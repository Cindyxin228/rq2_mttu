"2024-07-22T13:19:38Z"}, "body": "### Why\r\nThe `ngrok` backend is now accepting a new field for policy called `TrafficPolicy`. Unlike the original `Policy` field which was a highly structured protobuf, this new field is simply a string. The SDK therefore needs to be supported to send this new String policy field to the backend.\r\nAdditionally, we want users who are using the old `Policy` field to still be able to use that until we fully deprecate inbound/outbound so they only have to update their code once. Therefore, this change also serializes the old `Policy` field as a JSON string and sends it to the backend as `TrafficPolicy`.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThe policy field in the proto representation was renamed to `TrafficPolicy` and changed to a new enum type called `PolicyWrapper`. This new enum allows it to be either a `String` (new configuration) or a `Policy` (old configuration). For string, this just gets sent as is, over the wire, which works. For `Policy`, a new serialization method was added to convert it into a string upon serialization. Additionally, the serialization for action configs had to be updated to convert it from a `Vec<u8>` to a `String`. \r\n\r\nIn the BindOpts for each connection type, the `PolicyWrapper` is populated by either the `String` or the `Policy` type, depending on what the user set.\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\nTunnels using the old `Policy` stuff and the new `TrafficPolicy` field were opened through the `axum` example. Both successfully started and had working policy.\r\n\r\nA unit test was added to make sure `Policy` serializes and deserializes as we expect.\r\n\r\n### Why did I update the flake?\r\nI was getting an error from a number of different CI test, stating that the `#[diagnostic]` namespace is experimental. I found [this thread](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/discussions/2682) stating that it could be caused by using an outdated version of rust nightly. Considering we hadn't updated since Feb, I ran a quick `nix flake update` and everything seemed to work.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/issues/145/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/issues/145/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/issues/144", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/issues/144/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/issues/144/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/issues/144/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust/pull/144", "id": 2373262137, "node_id": "PR_kwDOIRJeAc5zh2XV", "number": 144, "title": "add rust language server to flake", "user": {"login": "TheConcierge", "id": 10949861, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ5ODYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10949861?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge", "html_url": "https://github.com/TheConcierge", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheConcierge/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-06-25T17:36:19Z", "updated_at": "2024-06-25T18:54:33Z", "closed_at": "2024-06-25T18:54:33Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ngrok/ngrok-rust/pulls/144", "html_url": "https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust/pull/144", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust/pull/144.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-rust/pull/144.patch", "merged_at": "2024-06-25T18:54:33Z"}, "body": "### Why \r\nFor nix-based workflow, we often install language servers within the project we are working on.
