Also the number of places where this type is needed (the additional account ID) increased because now the _oplog_ requires to have an associated account ID for each operation. Although this change increases the required information to be transferred in many cases, it unified the API a bit as now everything requires a combination of worker id and account id: this can be explained by worker executor needs to know who owns the worker, but it does not want to query an external service to determine so - so this information must be passed from the outer layers where authorization already calculated the information anyway (or in case all worker belongs to the same account, it is passed as a constant value).\r\n\r\nThe primary reason for passing this ownership information down to the oplog service is to be able to store oplog archives grouped by accounts, similarly how custom blobs are already stored grouped by accounts.

\r\n\r\nIntroduces three storage types:\r\n- key-value storage (also supporting storing sets and sorted sets) \r\n- indexed storage\r\n- blob storage\r\n\r\nThe key-value storage and indexed storage has Redis and in-memory implementations, the blob storage has S3, in-memory and local file system based implementations.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code as individual services no longer have different implementations (for example `PromiseService` used to have a redis and an in-memory implementation now there is only a single one depending on key-value storage, etc)\r\n\r\nAll three storage interfaces get _namespaces_ which are fixed enums, and they can use it in different ways to determine how to implement data. For example in Redis it affects key prefixes, and whether to use hashed objects or not, but other implementations may use it to use different tables, or choose to just use it as part of a key.\r\n\r\nCleaned up key paths in redis a bit (no longer using `instance:` for example)\r\n\r\nChanged how blob-storage is implemented: previously it was creating an S3 bucket for each \"container\" in the WASI blob-storage interface which is not very good because the number of buckets is limited in an AWS account and it also requires more rights than desirable.

\r\n* Evaluation of an expression now takes an `EvaluationContext` that can hold the values of global namespaces such as worker,  request, or custom variables (foo), instead of an arbitrary type-annotated-value\r\n\r\n* During evaluation of an expression in an `EvaluationContext`, the child values in these global namespaces get converted to `TypeAnnotatedValue` which is typed evaluation, allowing us to do things like `if request.user_id  == 1`. The difference here is, until evaluation we are never converting any of these details to `TypeAnnotatedValue`.\r\n\r\n* The `request` namespace in EvaluationContext is basically an `enum` of `Http` or in future `Grpc` and if it is `Http`, it will consist of `HttpRequestDetails`.\r\n \r\n* With this PR, more selection fields are supported. `worker.name`, `worker.component_id`, `worker.idempotency-key` , `worker.response` (implies `worker.response.foo`), `request.headers.idempotency-key`, `request.headers.foo`, `request.user-id` and so on.\r\n\r\n## `RefinedWorkerResponse` - instead of response always being a vector\r\n\r\n* After worker executor is executes the  resolved worker request, the response `WorkerResponse` is converted to `RefinedWorkerResponse` \r\n\r\n* `RefinedWorkerResponse` consist of refined results, by making  use of FunctionResult metadata to identify if they are named multiple results, or a single result, or unit function. This implies, the final http response goes from `RefinedWorkerResponse`. Therefore we have a `to_http_response` function under `RefinedWorkerResponse` given a `ResponseMapping` and  original`RequestDetails`  (in case mapping refers back to the original request details)\r\n\r\n\r\n* The logic is also done with the _assumptions_ which I confirmed by going through WASM AST code which essentially result in the current model of `FunctionResult` in golem-services/model.rs\r\n\r\n## Change in API Gateway Workflow\r\n\r\n* Step 1: Given the above changes, the workflow also had to be simplified. Now for a custom http request hitting the worker-bridge, it looks up the API definition corresponding to the request path pattern.\r\n\r\n* Step 2: Resolve the `worker-binding` (called `ResolvedWorkerBinding given the original http request, and `api-definition`. This is by making use of the instance of `WorkerBindingResolver` for `InputHttpRequest`. In future we will have `WorkerBindingResolver` instance for `GrpcRequest`.\r\n\r\n* Step 3: Unlike before, `ResolvedWorkerBinding` has concrete `WorkerRequest`, `RequestDetails` as well as optional `ResponseMapping`. Previously, we kept propagating the entire binding, partial informations (as expressions) which is not super easy to reason about.\r\n\r\n* Step 3: `ResolvedWorkerBinding` has `execute_with` function that executes the `WorkerRequest` and emit a Response (`A)` in the binding (given an executor) and instance of `ToResponse<A>`  for the `WorkerResponse`. Currently we have instances of `ToResponse<poem::Response>` for `WorkerResponse` as well as `WorkerExecutorError`. This allows us to easily add a GRPC version of these instances, without repeating the workflow.\r\n\r\n### Minor: Spec changes\r\n* Use `component_id ` instead of component\r\n* Use `worker_name` instead of `worker_id` (it's a name and not the worker-id)\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/golemcloud/golem/issues/475/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

"2024-04-12T02:02:26Z"}, "body": "### Features and fixes\r\n\r\n* Support for pattern matching on variants\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// given worker.response TypeAnnotatedValue::Variant { Foo ..}\r\n\r\nmatch worker.response {\r\n   Foo(value) => value.id\r\n   Bar(value) => value.id\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Fixed nested pattern matching - recursively identify the patterns\r\n```scala\r\n// given worker.response TypeAnnotatedValue::Variant { Foo ..{ Option { Result }\r\n\r\nmatch worker.response {\r\n   Foo(some(ok(value)) => value.id\r\n   Bar(none) => value.id\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Support on wild card\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nmatch worker.response {\r\n   some(_) => worker.response.id\r\n   none => 'not found'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Support on alias\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nmatch worker.response { \r\n  a @ ok(b @ _) => b \r\n  c @ err(d @ ok(e)) => {p : c, q: d, r: e.id} \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Introduction of TypeMismatch\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// given worker.response is TypeAnnotatedValue::U64(1)\r\n\r\n// Following will result in type-mismatch error for the first arm itself - where we tried to match 1 with `ok`\r\nmatch worker.response {\r\n   ok(_) => \"success\"\r\n   err(_) => \"failure\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Stricter pattern matching. Previously any value from worker.response could be considered as `Option::Some`. Now that we moved to `TypeAnnotatedValue` which clearly has `Some` and `None` types for optional values. So we can pattern match strictly, otherwise we get a `TypeMismatch` error.\r\n\r\n* Disallowed random constructions. Removed `Expr::Constructor0` to being explicit. That while we can pattern match on any variant, users cannot construct random constructors. \r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// Disallowed\r\nmatch worker.response {\r\n   some(_) => Foo(1)\r\n   none => 'not found'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Expr` cannot evaluate `Foo(1)` because it simply doesn't know what `Foo` is.\r\n\r\n* Expr::Result and Expr::Option (and removed Expr::Constructor0)\r\n\r\n* Tests in `text` module (for read and write) and `evaluator` module. The ones PR reviewers might be interested in is evaluator, to see the outcome of this PR\r\n\r\n\r\n* Cleanups that are as follows:\r\n   * Removed higher order functions to evaluate if-else expressions\r\n   * Separate module for if-else, to be consistent with other patterns\r\n   * Removed the complex structure InternalExprResult (which was holding a function insider, on what to do in the next loop). Works well only in Scala!\r\n   * Renaming. A pattern match should consist of `match_expression` and a collection of `arms` and LHS of `arm` is `arm_pattern` and rhs of arm is `arm_body`, following consistent naming around pattern matching expressions in the wild.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThere can be many things where we could optimize, I do have an eye on these things, but I think time to take a step back and progress with what we have now, and optimize it with specific tickets in place.   \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/golemcloud/golem/issues/368/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

RadixNode\r\n   - Implementation of a Radix Tree for an Http Router\r\n   - Supports: \r\n      - Literal Paths: `api`\r\n      - Variable Paths: `{worker-id}`\r\n      - Catch all paths: `*`\r\n- Router is used to validate incoming requests, and to validate that API Route Definitions are all unique during creation/update\r\n> The paths `/worker/{worker-id}` and `/worker/{id}` would conflict, regardless of variable name, because they have the same structure\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nThe fastest map implementation that I tested was FxHashMap. Here's the comparison after changing it from VecMap. \r\n\r\nTwo parameters are used in the latest benchmark\r\n- `hit` is the hit rate\r\n- `len` is the number of routes loaded into the tree\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmatches/len=10/hit=25   time:   [52.327 ns 52.882 ns 53.522 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-17.705% -16.328% -15.036%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/len=20/hit=25   time:   [58.998 ns 59.434 ns 59.869 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-19.565% -18.165% -16.963%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\nmatches/len=50/hit=25   time:   [66.727 ns 67.267 ns 67.837 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-17.955% -17.225% -16.383%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 4 outliers among 100 measurements (4.00%)\r\n  3 (3.00%) high mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/len=100/hit=25  time:   [69.895 ns 70.637 ns 71.355 ns]                                   \r\n                        change: [-21.483% -19.691% -18.186%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) low mild\r\nmatches/len=10/hit=50   time:   [55.228 ns 55.857 ns 56.491 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-15.261% -14.226% -13.151%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\nmatches/len=20/hit=50   time:   [61.549 ns 62.336 ns 63.355 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-18.253% -17.287% -16.300%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 2 outliers among 100 measurements (2.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/len=50/hit=50   time:   [68.583 ns 69.021 ns 69.456 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-22.123% -21.335% -20.621%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)\r\n  2 (2.00%) low mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\nmatches/len=100/hit=50  time:   [72.845 ns 73.404 ns 74.065 ns]                                   \r\n                        change: [-27.565% -25.900% -24.629%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 8 outliers among 100 measurements (8.00%)\r\n  3 (3.00%) low mild\r\n  3 (3.00%) high mild\r\n  2 (2.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/len=10/hit=75   time:   [59.045 ns 60.482 ns 62.218 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-12.785% -10.543% -7.8619%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\n  2 (2.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/len=20/hit=75   time:   [65.270 ns 66.695 ns 68.463 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-14.711% -13.262% -11.729%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)\r\n  3 (3.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/len=50/hit=75   time:   [71.911 ns 72.447 ns 72.962 ns]                                  \r\n                        change: [-22.867% -20.607% -19.000%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nmatches/len=100/hit=75  time:   [75.373 ns 75.710 ns 76.035 ns]                                   \r\n                        change: [-22.211% -21.144% -20.269%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\n```\r\n\r\n## OLD Performance\r\n\r\nThe route tree uses a radix tree which compresses the tree and makes it faster to traverse than a normal trie.\r\n\r\nEach node keeps a Vec of child nodes `Vec<(Pattern, RadixNode)>` in sorted order for static/literal paths. When searching for a literal node, we use binary search to make it more efficient. When checking a path, we will check all the static paths before checking if there is a variable path. \r\n\r\nThis is faster than a `BTreeMap <Pattern, RadixNode>` in the benchmarks\r\n\r\nWe still need a way to cache these Routers, because for now they're being generated on every incoming request. They are not cheap to construct.\r\n\r\n### BTreeMap (UNUSED)\r\n```shell\r\nmatches/0/len=10        time:   [97.592 ns 99.020 ns 100.57 ns]                             \r\nFound 4 outliers among 100 measurements (4.00%)\r\n  4 (4.00%) high mild\r\nmatches/1/len=20        time:   [115.90 ns 117.24 ns 118.91 ns]                             \r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/2/len=50        time:   [142.36 ns 143.79 ns 145.39 ns]                             \r\nFound 2 outliers among 100 measurements (2.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) low mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\nmatches/3/len=100       time:   [158.92 ns 159.78 ns 160.68 ns]                              \r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sorted Vec + Binary Search (USED)\r\n```shell\r\nmatches/0/len=10        time:   [60.163 ns 61.361 ns 62.583 ns]                             \r\n                        change: [-38.599% -37.484% -36.371%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nmatches/1/len=20        time:   [67.535 ns 68.440 ns 69.303 ns]                             \r\n                        change: [-42.160% -41.477% -40.789%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 1 outliers among 100 measurements (1.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\nmatches/2/len=50        time:   [78.137 ns 78.753 ns 79.358 ns]                             \r\n                        change: [-45.887% -45.351% -44.864%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 2 outliers among 100 measurements (2.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) low mild\r\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\r\nmatches/3/len=100       time:   [85.419 ns 85.849 ns 86.285 ns]                              \r\n                        change: [-47.168% -46.452% -45.929%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\r\n                        Performance has improved.\r\nFound 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)\r\n  1 (1.00%) low mild\r\n  2 (2.00%) high mild\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Performance (OLDEST)\r\n> This benchmark uses [divan](https://github.com/nvzqz/divan) but the reports were sub-optimal and there was a lot of noise.

"2024-04-09T09:41:55Z"}, "body": "Fixes #351 \r\nFixes #244 \r\nFixes #184 \r\nFixes #224 \r\n\r\nDocumentation on what's being done in progress:  https://www.notion.so/golemcloud/Worker-Bridge-Expression-Language-and-Recent-Developments-869c9b5d4a6d44f988d49adb500ce07b\r\n\r\nThe document will also cover some better explanation of the immediate tickets, since I feel some ticket details seem to be opaque.\r\n\r\n### Main parts of the PR\r\n\r\n* A complete revamp of read-write of `Expr`. Basically the syntax of `Expr` was up in the air until now  and now on it's `mostly` aligned with wasm-wave syntax.\r\n   * A **new writer module** handling writing Expr back.  https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/support_wave/golem-worker-service-base/src/expression/writer.rs. This is far more maintainable than what was before which was complicated code.\r\n   * A **new text module** with `from_string` and `to_string` for `Expr`: https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/support_wave/golem-worker-service-base/src/expression/text.rs\r\n   * These modules are with in `expression` module\r\n  \r\n* A complete rewrite of **tests for `Expr`  read-write round-trips,** covering another ticket. I have tried to come up with a _pattern_ in tests and make our `Expr` far more reliable. Check them out: https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/support_wave/golem-worker-service-base/src/expression/text.rs.  This spec covers all combinations of `Expr` within each type of `Expr` fixing numerous number of bugs. Tests are further divided into various modules `record_tests`, `sequence_tests`, `tuple_tests`, `flag_tests` etc.\r\n  \r\n* A complete revamp of `tokenizer` since we needed much more maintainable approach to handle complex usecases and parsing.  **Basically, `Cursor` is disappeared and `Tokeniser` is lazy**, with lots of new helper functions that helps with `Expr` parsing. https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/support_wave/golem-worker-service-base/src/tokeniser/tokenizer.rs#L218\r\n\r\n* A **new rules module** within tokenizer module. The opening-ending of tokens was all over the place before, killing time when trying to change code. Therefore introduced a `Rules` module within tokeniser to handle lookups that involves skipping nested tokens. Example: Find the position of the comma of the outer list in `[ [a, b], [c, d]]` or `({ flag1, flag2}, [ a, b], { a : b, c: d }]`. https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/support_wave/golem-worker-service-base/src/tokeniser/token_start_end_rules.rs \r\n\r\n* And obviously the main part which is expr parsing supporting wasm wave syntax (as much as I can, but will continue to do some minor changes in further PRs). https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/tree/support_wave/golem-worker-service-base/src/parser/expr. Each types has its own module for parsing, and all of these modules have functions that follow a common pattern making it maintainable \r\n\r\n\r\nI know there are changes here, but there is none that is unimportant here, and that's why I am trying to write a document on what's being covered here. \r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/golemcloud/golem/issues/356/reactions",

involving the worker executor tests, integration and sharding tests, and the (not merged) benchmarking suite.\r\n\r\nIntroduces a base library for all tests and benchmarks, and rebases the existing test code to use it.\r\n\r\n- Resolves #234\r\n- Resolves #235 \r\n- Resolves #236 \r\n- Resolves #237 \r\n- Resolves #327 \r\n\r\nThe primary motivation is to be able to use the same set of helper functions (test and benchmark DSL) for all layers of testing:\r\n- worker executor tests (only running worker executor itself as a \"libarary\")\r\n- integration tests (spawning multiple services, talking to them with gRPC)\r\n- golem-cli tests \r\n- benchmarks (with the ability to set up and talk to remote infrastructure)\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by restructuring and unifying the existing code, having:\r\n\r\n**test dependencies**\r\n\r\nThese are all the services (golem or third party) that are required for running the tests. Each has a couple of implementation, each implementation responsible for starting and stopping the dependency as well as being able to set up a communication channel to it, and to describe for other services how to access it (private / public host and IPs - private to be used \"between dependencies\", public to be used from the test runner)\r\n\r\n**configurations**\r\n\r\nThere are three implementations of `TestDependencies`, each setting up them in different ways.\r\n\r\n- `WorkerExecutorTestDependencies` only used for worker executor tests, and sets up the \"fake\", partial test dependency set that is enough to use the same DSL functions for worker executor tests as for the real integration tests\r\n- `EnvBasedTestDependencies` makes decisions based on environment variables and should work the same as the previous test runners worked\r\n- `CliTestDependencies` parses command line arguments and allows to configure all implementations of test dependencies (provided (already running), spawned (as native processes), docker, minikube and k8s-on-aws). This is intended to be used for benchmarks.\r\n\r\n**DSL**\r\nThe current set of test functions work on any `TestDependencies`, and it is mostly copied from what prevously was the worker executor tests.\r\nThere is also a separate set of types and functions targeting benchmarks, with an initial capability of recording key-value pairs where value is either a duration or a count, calculating some statistics, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Key differences from the previous code:**\r\n- The worker invocation test fuction now takes `wasm_rpc::Value`\r\n- The K8s resource dropping is now reseted to the \"drop each resource\" implementation - this probably has to be changed back to drop a full namespace but I wanted to see if it works.\r\n- I have dropped all `Result` propagation in the test code because I found that just panicking as early as possible provides a better test-debugging experience, and slightly simplifies the code\r\n- The test dependency implementations are more separated than before - using `dyn` traits\r\n- Avoided passing around the docker client lifetime (and had to because of the dyn traits) by assuming that for the tests, one global docker client is good enough.\r\n- Had to change the minikube port forwarding implementation to work on non-linux too. Tried to keep the linux implementation as well but did not test it.\r\n\r\n**Stability:**\r\n\r\n- The sharding tests now contain the new \"scripted\" version as well as the previous random one. The random one is still flaky, probably because of the known sharding-manager issues. If it is annoyingly flaky we can ignore it but I don't want to compeltely delete it\r\n- The benchmarks are now independent of the infrastructure setup in a way that they can be tested with fully local (\"spawned\" or \"docker\" modes). This works. However the minikube version fails for me for a weird reason (not being able to create the environment the _second_ time even though everything seems to be deleted).\r\n- Did not test on real AWS infra, but the code is the same as in the previous benchmark PR so if that worked it should still work.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/golemcloud/golem/issues/352/reactions",
