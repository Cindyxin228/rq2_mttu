implemented as an additional capability, but the implementation is not exactly obvious, and this type of use needs to be supported by the capabilities being orchestrated across, especially `crux_http`.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make the use of `async` across multiple capabilities more obvious. There are a few challenges to overcome\r\n\r\n- [x] The Orchestrate capability should probably come with crux_core\r\n- [ ] ~Automatically derive `Clone` for capabilities and the `Capabilities` struct, to avoid various lifetime errors when moving the capabilities or the context into the async blocks~  - decided against, it would conflict with custom `Clone` implementations\r\n- [x] Provide a `Never` operation type\r\n- [x] Avoid producing an `Effect` variant for capabilities who's ~operations are `Never` ()~ fields are `#[effect(skip)]`\r\n- [x] The use needs thorough documentation and an example\r\n- [ ] Existing capabilities need to expose an async version of their APIs (#180, #181, #182)\r\n\r\nAll feedback on the ergonomics of this is welcome at this stage, but I'd like to aim to ship this soon, ideally this week.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/redbadger/crux/issues/179/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":

There's also not much that can be done to handle it.

I'm opening this PR mainly to show that this combination works, and seems as clean as any of the other examples. This is all possible because of @charypar 's recent changes in #87. I'm not sure if we want to add this example to the repo. I realize that every example is a maintenance commitment, and we can't include everything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, some notes:\r\n\r\n- much of the code is lifted from other `counter` examples (e.g. cli), so it should be pretty familiar\r\n- the UI is vanilla React, but the React component is copied from `examples/web-nextjs`\r\n- so far I've only built this in the desktop dev environment\r\n    - I haven't packaged the app yet\r\n    - I've tried building iOS unsuccessfully. Tauri mobile is still in alpha, and it's pretty unstable at the moment. I just haven't had time to slog through the errors. This should be easy to update once the Tauri dependency settles down.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd examples/counter\r\ncargo build --package shared\r\ncargo build --package shared_types\r\ncd tauri\r\npnpm install\r\npnpm tauri dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: Corrected the `pnpm tauri dev` command that was causing an error with the missing `dist` folder", "reactions": {"url":

"2023-04-11T16:23:33Z"}, "body": "So far, the Crux core was fused together with the serialisation code supporting the FFI. This PR makes changes to separate the serialisation code into a self-contained Bridge, which will handle\r\n\r\n* Serialising and deserialising data for the FFI\r\n* Parking the effects emitted by the app under a UUID so they can be resolved later once the Shell is done.\r\n\r\nThe key changes in this are in how `Effects`, `Steps`,  and `Operations` stack up. Previously, Steps contained Effects, which contained Operations. That meant that Steps did not have access to Operation type information and had to work on serialised bytes. By swapping the order, Steps are now generic over Operations and Effect bundle them into an enum for the purposed of dispatch. Each of the types has a specific job:\r\n\r\n* Effect allows a type-checked dispatch in the Shell to the right capability implementation\r\n* Step (now an enum too) captures the semantics of the interaction - is it a notification, a request with a single response, or a subscription with a stream of responses\r\n* Operation captures the data needed to fulfil the interaction, and with the `Operation::Output` type, also the type of the result\r\n\r\nThere are a few consequences:\r\n* Rust clients get a strongly typed API for the core with no serialisation in site \ud83c\udf89 \r\n* Capability context construction had to change because of the assymetry between a Context of Effect and Contex of Step<Operation> (not a big deal, just no introduce a different type for the initial construction and updated the macro)\r\n* Sadly, this changes the Shell API once more. It now needs to be aware of steps. \r\n* This should, however, allow us to build foreign language interfaces to the core which hide the serialisation entirely, making Crux look native to them, and that API can now be the stable managed interface. This means that type generation and serialisation changes should no longer impact Shells. Or at least not as often.\r\n* Not sure if AppTester is still necessary, it might be entirely possible to simply work with the core directly now\r\n\r\n@obmarg I'd love to get your feedback on the work so far. I'm fairly confident this will work, but I may have missed something major.\r\n\r\n## Updated on April 4th\r\n\r\nThere were more consequences in the end. \r\n\r\n* We ended up with two type sets for the bridge and the direct API. Both have an `Effect` and a `Request`, but they contain each other in a different order. Bridged effect is Request(Effect(Operation)), direct effect is Effect(Request(Operation)). This _may_ change later down to line, when we hide the UUID mechanics in the foreign language shells.\r\n* The second Effect (called `EffectFfi` by default) is also macro generated. Original Effect now implements a trait which the bridge uses to serialize it. That turns the effect into its Ffi counterpart and a `ResolveBytes` which is an equivalent of Resolve that takes serialized output of the Operation. \r\n* A benefit of all this is that the foreign shell interface did not need to change \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n# To do\r\n- [x] re-stack Effect and Step\r\n- [x] remove serialisation code\r\n- [x] revisit construction of CapabilityContext\r\n- [x] implement Bridge and StepRegistry for the new world\r\n- [x] rename things to make more sense (hopefully)\r\n- [x] organise modules in `crux_core` better\r\n- [x] revisit AppTester and see how to make its API better for the new Effect/Request/Operation structure\r\n- [x] update all Rust clients in examples, which now need to be ~step~ `Request` aware\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
