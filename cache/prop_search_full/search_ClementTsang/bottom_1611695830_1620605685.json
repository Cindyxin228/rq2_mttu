If relevant (such as any change that modifies the UI), **please provide screenshots** of the change:_\r\n\r\nThis PR accomplishes two things:\r\n\r\n1.  This PR aims to add `mount_filter` to the config file.  This allows a user to filter their disk widget entries by the mount name as well; this was particularly a problem in trying to address #431.\r\n2.  A slight rework of how the filter system works due to the need of being able to manage two potentially conflicting filter sources, since the disk widget will now potentially filter on both the disk name and the mount name.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the second point, the new behaviour is as such:\r\n1. Is the entry allowed through any filter? That is, does it match an entry in a filter where `is_list_ignored` is `false`? If so, we always keep this entry.\r\n2. Is the entry denied through any filter? That is, does it match an entry in a filter where `is_list_ignored` is `true`? If so, we always deny this entry.\r\n3. Anything else is allowed.\r\n\r\nThis main (breaking) change is really the third point.  This would mean that `temp_filter` and `net_filter`, when set to allow listed entries with `is_list_ignored = false`, are kinda... useless, as a whitelist in the scenario of being the *only* filter is kinda pointless.  But hopefully this shouldn't be a problem...?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate this change with some examples:\r\n\r\nSuppose we have no filters, and our disk list looks like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/115795043-2459f400-a39d-11eb-9425-24c2ab1352e0.png)\r\n\r\nIf I set my config file to:\r\n```toml\r\n[disk_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = true\r\nlist = [\"/dev/sda\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/115795073-363b9700-a39d-11eb-8455-8839eb98ce96.png)\r\n\r\nIf I set my config file to:\r\n```toml\r\n[mount_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = true\r\nlist = [\"/mnt/.*\", \"/\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/115795175-6aaf5300-a39d-11eb-9eda-53e1bf2e0408.png)\r\n\r\nIf I set it to:\r\n```toml\r\n[disk_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = true\r\nlist = [\"/dev/sda\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = false\r\n\r\n[mount_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = true\r\nlist = [\"/mnt/.*\", \"/\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = true\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/115795207-77cc4200-a39d-11eb-9f6c-48c9e1db4292.png)\r\n\r\nNow let's show conflicting examples.  Suppose I set it to:\r\n```toml\r\n[disk_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = true\r\nlist = [\"/dev/sda\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = false\r\n\r\n[mount_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = false\r\nlist = [\"/mnt/.*\", \"/\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we get are saying that we want to ignore anything with `/dev/sda` in the string, but we want to also keep anything matching exactly `/mnt/*` or `/`.  So, we end up keeping only the entries that are allowed by the `mount_filter`, while rejecting anything left that matches `disk_filter`, then keeping everything else.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/115795245-8b77a880-a39d-11eb-855f-ddc16bd0bc51.png)\r\n\r\nAnd if we flip it around?\r\n```toml\r\n[disk_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = false\r\nlist = [\"/dev/sda\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = false\r\n\r\n[mount_filter]\r\nis_list_ignored = true\r\nlist = [\"/mnt/.*\", \"/\"]\r\nregex = true\r\ncase_sensitive = false\r\nwhole_word = true\r\n```\r\nBy our logic, we should keep anything matching `/dev/sda` and then reject anything left that matches the `mount_filter`.

If relevant (such as any change that modifies the UI), **please provide screenshots** of the change:_\r\n\r\nFor the process widget, we now sum the resource usage of the child processes on the parent entry when collapsing in tree mode.\r\n\r\nFor example - before collapsing:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113538978-a202bf00-95aa-11eb-85fb-82dd6e488cb4.png)\r\n\r\nAfter collapsing:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113538987-a7600980-95aa-11eb-809a-b8634ad0f80c.png)\r\n\r\nNote that if you search to filter, and collapse, it will not sum the pruned values (values that cannot be seen).  This is partly because I'm a bit lazy, and partly because I think this behaviour makes sense.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I search for a process with 4 child processes \"AA, AB, BA, BB\", with CPU usage 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 respectively.  Assume the parent process has 0 usage.\r\n\r\n- Without filter, it sums to 1.0\r\n- With a filter on A, it would sum to just 0.3\r\n- With a filter on AA, it would sum to 0.1\r\n\r\nI think this is fine because I'm treating this as summing any child that is still *visible* somehow.  Summing unseen values would probably be weird as it would look like it's not adding up.\r\n\r\nFurther note that if you had, say, a child \"CC\" with a usage of, say, 2.0, and its parent of \"AB\", and you searched for CC in our above example, you would get a sum of 2.2.  This is because AB is still visible by the fact that CC was the searched process, and AB must still exist (albeit faded out) in the tree hierarchy, and as such will still be displayed.\r\n\r\nWe can see this here:\r\n\r\nSearching \"btm\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539788-93b5a280-95ac-11eb-98f9-a7ce62531b96.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539808-9adcb080-95ac-11eb-857b-914be6f9d24b.png)\r\n\r\nSearching for \"zsh\" instead:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539839-ac25bd00-95ac-11eb-9a4c-4cce86ace75c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539846-afb94400-95ac-11eb-9bc6-3f4f809b9287.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n_If applicable, what issue does this address?_\r\n\r\nCloses: #424\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n_Remove the irrelevant ones:_\r\n\r\n- [x] _New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)_\r\n\r\n## Test methodology\r\n\r\n_If relevant, please state how this was tested:_\r\n\r\n_Furthermore, please tick which platforms this change was tested on:_\r\n\r\n- [ ] _Windows_\r\n- [ ] _macOS_\r\n- [x] _Linux_\r\n\r\n_If relevant, all of these platforms should be tested._\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_If relevant, ensure the following have been met:_\r\n\r\n- [x] _Change has been tested to work, and does not cause new breakage unless intended_\r\n- [x] _Code has been self-reviewed_\r\n- [x] _Documentation has been added/updated if needed (README, help menu, etc.)_\r\n- [x] _Passes CI pipeline (clippy check and `cargo test` check)_\r\n- [x] _Areas your change affects have been linted using rustfmt (`cargo fmt`)_\r\n- [x] _No merge conflicts arise from the change_\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n_Provide any other relevant information to this change:_\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/445/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/445/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444", "id": 849996305, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjA4NjM4MTIx", "number": 444, "title": "refactor: Switch from fnv to fxhash", "user": {"login": "ClementTsang", "id": 34804052, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODA0MDUy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34804052?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang", "html_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-04-05T00:34:25Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-05T00:48:20Z", "closed_at": "2021-04-05T00:48:19Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/pulls/444", "html_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444.patch", "merged_at": "2021-04-05T00:48:19Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n_A description of the change and what it does.

This still has one step to be optimized (cache results so we don't have to recalculate the legend each time), but will be done in another PR for sake of this one being too large already.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this change adds linear interpolation at the 0 point in the case a data point shoots too far back - this seems to have lead to ugly gaps to the left of graphs in some cases, because the left hand limit was not big enough for the data point.

If relevant, please provide screenshots of what results from the change:_\r\n\r\nTwo issues were highlighted as a result of using either Void Linux with disk encryption, or just disk encryption on Linux in general:\r\n\r\nTwo fixes:\r\n1. Fixes a failed `usage()` call in the `get_disk_usage` function from failing the entire result.  Now it only returns an entry with N/A results.  This occurred in some distros and disk encryption setups, for example, [the one for Void Linux](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/fde.html).\r\n2. Fixes a potential mapping issue with disk encryption on Linux in general.  Since the disk might map to `/dev/mapper/whatever`, but the I/O harvester was using another name, the mappings would not match.
