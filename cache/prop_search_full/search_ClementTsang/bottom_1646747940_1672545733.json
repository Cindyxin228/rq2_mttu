I've already stopped using it for 99% of my workflows at this point, so this is probably for the better.\r\n\r\nNote some actions are out of my control and have not yet updated - tracking list:\r\n\r\n- ~~`rustsec/audit-check` is on Node 12.~~ Resolved, see #1145 \r\n- ~~`upload-artifact` uses `set-output` (https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/351)~~ Resolved, see #887\r\n- ~~`action-gh-release` uses `set-output` (https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/issues/268)~~ Resolved, see #946\r\n- ~~`dev-drprasad/delete-tag-and-release` uses Node 12.~~ Resolved, see #888 \r\n\r\nThis also removes the GitHub workflow for macOS ARM since that is now handled by Cirrus CI.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n_If applicable, what issue does this address?_\r\n\r\nCloses: #\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n_If relevant, please state how this was tested.

If relevant (such as any change that modifies the UI), **please provide screenshots** of the change:_\r\n\r\nThe sysinfo crate grabs data in a way that sometimes will not work based on permissions on macOS, leading to some missing data - one case this comes up is parent PIDs, particularly noticeable in tree mode. Unless you run the program with `sudo`, if the parent PID is 1, the current sysinfo crate will fail to grab the parent PID for a process.\r\n\r\nThis can be circumvented by taking a page from htop's book and use `kinfo_procs` ([see here](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/0af08bcfc99e9533e84b84e374ce17a3c01b81e1/darwin/DarwinProcessList.c#L158)). This is actually what `heim` uses, and we can leverage some of its implementation over here to grab ppid in cases that sysinfo fails. In the future, we can further leverage this to get even more data (e.g. for missing processes).\r\n\r\nWe can see this demonstrated here - left is the new implementation, right is the old. We see how the left one correctly shows the tree structure since it can actually detect the PPIDs, while the right fails to do this correctly since it cannot find the PPID for some of the processes and ends up promoting those processes to orphans.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"620\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/195217023-2903a3a9-3398-4c4e-a3b2-86574116759e.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n_If applicable, what issue does this address?_\r\n\r\nCloses: #\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n_If relevant, please state how this was tested.
