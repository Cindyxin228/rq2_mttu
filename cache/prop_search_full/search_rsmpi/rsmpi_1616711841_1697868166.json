unintuitive to split the Communicator interface in `SystemCommunicator` and `UserCommunicator`.\r\nI drafted a PR to unify both into one common `enum SimpleCommunicator`:\r\n\r\n- I migrated topology-related code from UserCommunicator into the common enum, so both communicator variants can now call those functions. I couldn't confirm it outright, but the spec does not prohibit that explicitely, so I think this models the MPI interface more closely.\r\n- I refactored CartesianCommunicator to accept both World- and UserCommunicator, which is legal by spec, I don't know why this wasn't possible before.\r\n- since WorldCommunicator is no longer Copy, code that moved a reference to SystemCommunicator must now explicitly refer to IntraCommunicator::WorldCommunicator (see immediate_multiple_test.rs)\r\n- I added SelfCommunicator next to WorldCommunicator, because the MPI spec defines it and without it downstream crates would need unsafe code to create it, and call `free` on it when their `UserCommunicator` drops\r\n\r\nThings missing from this draft:\r\n\r\nThere is another weird split in the code-base: InterCommunicators use `SystemCommunicatorHandle` and `UserCommunicatorHandle`, even though those handle structs do the exact same as their communicator-counterparts (at least as far as I can tell).\r\nSince I have never worked with InterCommunicators before though, and there are neither integration-tests nor examples for them, I didn't migrate them to use `SimpleCommunicator` yet, as I wanted to get some feedback on their purpose.\r\n\r\nAll examples and tests are green, but I am not very familiar with the codebase yet, so somebody should scrutinize this.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/issues/155/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/issues/155/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/issues/154", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/issues/154/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/issues/154/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/issues/154/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi/pull/154", "id": 1613922556, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAlpA1s5LgEAj", "number": 154, "title": "CI: allow default llvm in Windows", "user": {"login": "jedbrown", "id": 3303, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3303?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown", "html_url": "https://github.com/jedbrown", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jedbrown/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-03-07T17:42:35Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-07T22:01:38Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-07T22:01:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsmpi/rsmpi/pulls/154", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi/pull/154", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi/pull/154.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi/pull/154.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-07T22:01:38Z"}, "body": "Choco with --version 14.0.6 errors with the following.

I expect it will work with upstream clang on Cray.\r\n\r\nI also fixed some incomplete propagation of `mpicc` and include paths that previously caused `rsmpi.c` to be compiled using default paths, and thus fail or build for the wrong MPI when intending to use a non-default MPI.\r\n\r\n@skailasa or @tbetcke Would you be able to test this on one of your systems?", "reactions": {"url":

This is partly based on @AndrewGaspar's original PR #36 but is slightly different. Based on some of the discussion in #29, I experimented with attaching references to each request as a way to allow the user to immediately perform some computation on the data as soon as the request has been waited on.\r\n\r\nUsing the modified request object as a basis I added a RequestCollection object, similar to the former PR, but including support for attached references. Requests can be added to the collection and then waited on using the wait_*() or test_*() methods. To ensure that requests have completed, I included a new `multiple_scope()` function which passes in both a reference to a scope object and a request collection.", "reactions": {"url":
