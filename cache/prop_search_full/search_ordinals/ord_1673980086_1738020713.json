previously some times the first savepoint would have been the tip/really close to tip sometimes and if a reorg happened it could not restore at all\r\n* if above happened it tried to infinitely restore the snapshot and it increased the index size by 1GB every few minutes (would be good to understand why did that happen)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThis happened while trying to index testnet4(ord 22.1), and it indexes all the way to the tip (in my case 63038), then this happens:\r\n* it commits to the tip and creates the savepoint at the tip. \r\n* Then a reorg of deep 2 happens, ord tries to rollback to oldest savepoint which is still 63038, thinks its recoverable (but its not, as the savepoint is not that old), \r\n* reverts to the oldest savepoint which basically does nothing, \r\n* and then does this in an infinite loop and increases the used disk space exponentially its like 1 more GB each 2-3 mins.

`/r/sat/<SAT_NUMBER>/at/<INDEX>/content` that returns the raw content of inscriptions on a specific sat at a given index. This endpoint complements the existing `/r/sat/<SAT_NUMBER>/at/<INDEX>` endpoint by directly returning the inscription content instead of just the inscription ID.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- New endpoint `/r/sat/<SAT_NUMBER>/at/<INDEX>/content`\r\n- Supports negative indices (e.g., -1 for most recent inscription)\r\n- Returns appropriate mime-type and content\r\n- Requires `--index-sats` flag like other sat-based endpoints\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- Added detailed documentation in `docs/src/inscriptions/recursion.md`\r\n- Includes example usage with curl\r\n- Follows existing recursive endpoint documentation format\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Endpoint follows the same pattern as existing recursive endpoints\r\n- Returns proper content-type headers and raw inscription content\r\n- Handles negative indices correctly\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -s -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\r\nhttp://0.0.0.0:80/r/sat/289488340427831/at/-1/content\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\n\r\nThis endpoint is particularly valuable for dynamic on-chain content that evolves over time through reinscriptions. For example:\r\n- On-chain blogs can automatically display their latest posts\r\n- Dynamic NFTs can fetch their most recent state\r\n- Decentralized applications can efficiently access updated content\r\n- Content aggregators can streamline their data fetching\r\n- Games can add special events that auto-update the game\r\n\r\nBy providing direct access to the latest inscription content on a specific sat, this endpoint reduces the number of API calls needed (from 2 to 1) and simplifies the development of applications that leverage reinscription functionality. This makes it easier to build applications that treat sats as updateable storage locations while maintaining the decentralized nature of ordinal inscriptions.

So to get the new behavior, you'll need to let it make one successful commit with the new code before you start making it crash.

hashes, outpoints, satpoints, addresses, and inscription IDs.\r\n\r\nAny node which has exactly one child node which is a text mode that matches a regex matching the above is eligible to be collapsed. A `data-original` attribute is added with the original text, and on resize, the size of the element is measured, and if smaller than the size of the text content, the text content is abridged in the middle with `\u2026`.\r\n\r\nSince the text content is now changed, we need to fix clipboard copying, so that users can copy the original unabridged text. This is accomplished by intersecting clipboard copy events, and, if they target a collapsible node, replacing the copied text with the original text. One failing of this approach is that if you copy multiple nodes, the target of the copy command will not be a collapsible node, but it may contain collapsible nodes, so the copied text will may contain abridged text. We could fix that by traversing the nodes which are copied and replacing any copied text with original text, but I think this PR is still an improvement, and we should merge it and fix that issue in a future PR.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which we should fix, I think also in a future PR, is not using heuristics to find collapsible nodes, and instead relying on the presence of a CSS class to determine if a node is collapsible. Since all collapsible items already have the CSS monospace class, we can simply replace `monospace` on collapsible classes with `collapsible`. (Or maybe `collapse`, since it's shorter and I can never spell \"collapsible\" on the first try.)\r\n\r\nOne thing which I'm not sure we can fully fix, but we should try, is visible resizing of the page after elements are collapsed. Text is collapsed after the page first renders, so element movement after collapsing is visible.\r\n\r\nEdit: Okay, I actually fixed visible resizing. I changed our JS from running as a `defer` script to running after the DOMContentLoaded event. This runs our JS after the DOM is loaded, but earlier than defer scripts, which wait for images, other scripts, stylesheets, etc. Apparently DOMContentLoaded runs before first render, so our JS can modify the HTML without the original HTML being visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>before and

I recently visited ordinals.com on windows, and there were hideous scrollbars on nearly every inscription.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a windows-specific issue, i.e., the scrollbars are there on macOS, they just look worse on Windows, which is why we didn't notice.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a couple things:\r\n\r\n- Add `float: left` to images in the image preview. This, for some reason, makes the images the correct size, so they don't overflow, due to some mysterious CSS behavior that I don't fully understand.\r\n- Add back `scrolling=no` to inscription thumbnails. This prevents scrollbars for appearing everywhere except the actual /inscription page, which I think is better. There's no reason to allow scrolling a thumbnail, especially if the user can just click it to scroll.\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure that we shouldn't just re-add `scrolling=no` to inscriptions. Users can click the content link if they want to scroll, and the bars on windows are absolutely disgusting looking. If you made an HTML inscription, previewed it on an old version of ord, and then inscribed it on mainnet, you're now getting scrollbars where before you didn't see any.\r\n\r\nHowever, this PR is a pareto improvement, unlikely removing scrollbars entirely, so I think we should merge this and if the remaining scroll bars are an issue, deal with them later.", "reactions": {"url":
