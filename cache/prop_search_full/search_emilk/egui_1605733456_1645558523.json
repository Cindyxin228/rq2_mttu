This returns an `egui::TextureHandle` which can be used with e.g. `ui.image(\u2026)`. The `TextureHandle` uses ref-counting, and when the last `TextureHandle` is dropped, the texture is freed. This makes it far more ergonomic and convenient to show images in `egui`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how to use it: https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/eframe/examples/image.rs\r\n\r\nBackend integrations need to adapt by handling the new `epaint::TexturesDelta` each frame, a struct that specifies what textures were loaded and freed each frame.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Currently, `f64::ord()` simply truncates to `f32`, which may yield incorrect results for high precision floats. I see three solutions:\r\n   * Make `OrderedFloat` generic on the float type. A bit more complex implementation, as we need to create traits to abstract over `f32` and `f64` for `is_nan()` etc.\r\n   * Use always `f32` (status quo) -- not recommended, can cause really nasty bugs\r\n   * Use always `f64` -- safe, but might incur minor performance penalty\r\n   \r\n2. Should this be part of the public API?\r\n   I moved it to a different crate, so it can't be `pub(crate)` anymore.

`Slider`. Closes #589.\r\n\r\n# What's new\r\n- Sliders demo now includes a radio button toggle for orientation\r\n- New enum `SliderOrientation` with variants `Horizontal` and `Vertical`\r\n- New mutator function `.orientation` to set the slider orientation\r\n- New constructor functions, `new_vertical` and `from_get_set_vertical` to instantiate with vertical orientation.\r\n- Vertical Sliders use alternate keycodes for increment/decrement (up/down instead of right/left).\r\n\r\n# What's changed\r\n- Replaces horizontal-specific Slider logic with some functions matching on `orientation` instead. Some functions and parameters are renamed (e.g. `x_range` -> `position_range`).\r\n- Some helper functions are now methods on `Slider` which match on the Slider's orientation.\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\n- If API breakage is ok, we could add an orientation argument to existing constructor functions (instead of creating new constructor functions).\r\n- We could expose only the `.orientation` mutator function (instead of changing or creating constructor functions).\r\n- We could expose a vertical slider as a different widget. The logic is similar enough that I think the sharing here is appropriate.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/875/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
