decided to revisit some of the changes from #24 and #21 . The main difference is that `Handler::sync` was changed back to return a `Result<SyncRequest, Error>`. The idea is basically that Handler shouldn't be _required_ to handle their own errors if they just want roperator to retry after a backoff period. This way, authors have the choice of whether they want to do their own error handling or let roperator do it for them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `roperator::handler::failable` module was added, which provides some other useful helpers for users who want to do some error handling in their Handlers. The `FailableHandler` trait was added to provide a somewhat more opinionated and simple trait for Handlers that want to opt in to error handling. The companion `DefaultFailableHandler` wraps `FalableHandler` impls and adapts them to the `Handler` trait.\r\n\r\nSo far, this seems like a better avenue for making error handling somewhat nicer, while still allowing users to easily implement it themselves. Nevertheless, I'd like to get some feedback on the API before cutting the 0.2 release.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/25/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/25/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/24", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/24/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/24/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/24/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/24", "id": 596234194, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDAwNTY5OTAw", "number": 24, "title": "WIP - Error handling tweaks", "user": {"login": "psFried", "id": 4495829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4495829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-04-08T00:45:07Z", "updated_at": "2020-04-08T01:47:06Z", "closed_at": "2020-04-08T01:47:01Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/pulls/24", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/24", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/24.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/24.patch", "merged_at": "2020-04-08T01:47:01Z"}, "body": "This PR rolls up the work done by @cassandracomar on #21 and some additional tweaks to the API and changes to get the tests working. The main difference between the API here and in #21 is that the error handling done by the framework is now totally separate from whatever error handling is done by the `Handler`. Handlers no longer return a `Result`, but instead return a `SyncResponse`, and they must do any error handling internally. This may seem initially like a regression, but the goal is to add a declarative API for building handler implementations that do various types of error handling for you.

A new impl has been added for `Handler` that sets up an error free `sync` function given a way to handle the possible errors from a fallible `sync` function. \r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change in both spec and semantics.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/21/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/21/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/20", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/20/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/20/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/20/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/20", "id": 589452760, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzk1MDAyNTA0", "number": 20, "title": "Add ability to specify a resync for some point in the future", "user": {"login": "psFried", "id": 4495829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4495829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-03-27T22:59:17Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-28T14:45:27Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-28T14:45:18Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/pulls/20", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/20", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/20.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/20.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-28T14:45:18Z"}, "body": "This PR doesn't add all of the error handling functionality we want, but rather just lays some of the groundwork. This implements a breaking change to the `SyncResponse` to add a new `resync` field. This field holds an `Option<std::time::Duration>`. If it's `Some`, then roperator will schedule a resync of the parent after the given time has elapsed. If `None` then the parent will only be synced again upon triggering any of the usual conditions. \r\n\r\nThe idea is that we can then support a variety of error handling and backoff strategies within handlers themselves, and can add provide an implementation that implements reasonable defaults.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth pointing out that this is all only for handling errors that originate from within the Handler impl itself. None of this applies to errors that originate from roperator itself of the k8s api server, since there's little that the Handler could do about those anyway. We might want to also add some sort of custom error handling for that type of thing, but it would be much more coarse grained, and would probably need to be provided in the `OperatorConfig` instead of the `SyncResponse`\r\n\r\nFinally, as implemented, this also supports scheduling re-syncs for happy-path scenarios, in addition to error-handling. These scenarios aren't super common, but there are definitely use cases where it's important. For example, if your operator syncs some state from a k8s resource to an external system, then it might be useful to check periodically in case the external resource gets out of sync.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/20/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/20/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/19", "id": 577615705, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1MzUxNzU0", "number": 19, "title": "Request has child", "user": {"login": "psFried", "id": 4495829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4495829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-03-09T02:04:03Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-09T02:44:27Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-09T02:44:24Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/pulls/19", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/19", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/19.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/19.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-09T02:44:24Z"}, "body": "This implements some of the suggestions from #12 . The reality of this ended up being a bit more tricky than expected. Basically, just because a resource exists in the `SyncRequest::children()` doesn't necessarily imply anything about its state. For example, a Pod resource could exist, even though the Pod _status_ indicates that it's no longer running. So a general function that's like `fn does_resource_exist(example_resource: &Value) -> bool` isn't actually a good fit in all cases, since the word \"exist\" could be interpreted in multiple ways, and a `bool` isn't actually a rich enough type to represent all the possible states.\r\n\r\nSo the solution I settled on for this was to simply have a function that returns a matching child resource if one exists. That way, users can inspect the state of it to decide how they should proceed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, I made some other quality of life improvements on `RequestChildren` and `Raw/TypedView`, and refactored the `ObjectId` and `ObjectIdRef` types. All the `Raw/TypedView` functions now accept `impl Into<ObjectIdRef<'_>>` instead of separate `namespace` and `name` arguments. This allows a lot more flexibility in how you can query about resources in `RequestChildren`, as it allows all functions to accept `&ObjectId` and `(&str, &str)` in addition to `ObjectIdRef`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18", "id": 577397730, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1MTkxMjE0", "number": 18, "title": "Request api improvements", "user": {"login": "psFried", "id": 4495829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4495829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-03-07T20:43:27Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-07T21:51:41Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-07T21:51:38Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/pulls/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-07T21:51:38Z"}, "body": "This PR includes some breaking changes in order to finally address #2 .
