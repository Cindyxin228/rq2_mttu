This is an embedded target.\r\n\r\nIn the past I've applied patches to `libunwind` in order to get it to work, however those patches are very difficult to get upstream. A recent change in llvm made C compiling difficult (https://reviews.llvm.org/D156642), and additional patches will be needed on top of Rust's hacked-up version of LLVM that adds support for SGX.\r\n\r\nWith these patches, along with an `unwinding` [backend](https://gist.github.com/xobs/0f322ff7432e117cd5ec0ad1a9e9fdf5) for the Rust `unwind` crate, I'm able to run tests and catch panics in Xous.\r\n\r\nThis patchset does two things:\r\n\r\n1. Add support for making `core` optional, which is necessary for building as part of the tree\r\n2. Make `text_base` optional, which is required due to the fact that Xous doesn't have this information and no platforms currently use it anyway\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that (2) is an API-level change, this API is not documented in either [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/unwinding/0.1.7/unwinding/index.html) or the `examples/` directory, so I'm not sure how widely used it is.", "reactions": {"url":
