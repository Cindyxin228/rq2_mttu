instead it is up to the build systems and users of `--check-cfg`\\[^check-cfg] to set it as a well known cfg using `--check-cfg=cfg(test)`.\n\n    This is done to enable build systems like Cargo to set it conditionally, as not all source files are suitable for unit tests.\n    [Cargo (for now) unconditionally sets the `test` cfg as a well known cfg](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14963).\n    \\[^check-cfg]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/check-cfg.html\n-   [Disable potentially incorrect type inference if there are trivial and non-trivial where-clauses](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132325)\n-   `std::env::home_dir()` has been deprecated for years, because it can give surprising results in some Windows configurations if the `HOME` environment variable is set (which is not the normal configuration on Windows). We had previously avoided changing its behavior, out of concern for compatibility with code depending on this non-standard configuration. Given how long this function has been deprecated, we're now fixing its behavior as a bugfix. A subsequent release will remove the deprecation for this function.\n-   [Make `core::ffi::c_char` signedness more closely match that of the platform-default `char`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132975)\n\n    This changed `c_char` from an `i8` to `u8` or vice versa on many Tier 2 and 3\n    targets (mostly Arm and RISC-V embedded targets).

(`-Cprofile-generate`, `-Cprofile-use`), which are unrelated and remain available.\n-   Support for the target named `wasm32-wasi` has been removed as the target is now named `wasm32-wasip1`. This completes the [transition](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/607) [plan](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/695) for this target following [the introduction of `wasm32-wasip1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120468) in Rust 1.78. Compiler warnings on [use of `wasm32-wasi`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126662) introduced in Rust 1.81 are now gone as well as the target is removed.\n-   [The syntax `&pin (mut|const) T` is now parsed as a type which in theory could affect macro expansion results in some edge cases](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130635#issuecomment-2375462821)\n-   [Legacy syntax for calling `std::arch` functions is no longer permitted to declare items or bodies (such as closures, inline consts, or async blocks).](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130443#issuecomment-2445678945)\n-   The `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` target's binary release of the standard library is now [built with the latest emsdk 3.1.68](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131533), which fixes an ABI-incompatibility with Emscripten >= 3.1.42. If you are locally using a version of emsdk with an incompatible ABI (e.g. before 3.1.42 or a future one), you should build your code with `-Zbuild-std` to ensure that `std` uses the correct ABI.\n-   [Declaring functions with a calling convention not supported on the current target now triggers a hard error](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129935)\n-   [The next-generation trait solver is now enabled for coherence, fixing multiple soundness issues](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130654)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"* * * * *\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR is behind base branch, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR was generated by [Mend Renovate](https://mend.io/renovate/).

[`v0.3.37`](https://redirect.github.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0337-2024-12-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.36...v0.3.37)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `Time::MAX`, equivalent to `time!(23:59:59.999999999)`\n-   `[year repr:century]` is now supported in format descriptions. When used in conjunction with\n    `[year repr:last_two]`, there is sufficient information to parse a date. Note that with the\n    `large-date` feature enabled, there is an ambiguity when parsing the two back-to-back.\n-   Parsing of `strftime`-style format descriptions, located at\n    `time::format_description::parse_strftime_borrowed` and\n    `time::format_description::parse_strftime_owned`\n-   `time::util::refresh_tz` and `time::util::refresh_tz_unchecked`, which updates information\n    obtained via the `TZ` environment variable. This is equivalent to the `tzset` syscall on Unix-like\n    systems, with and without built-in soundness checks, respectively.\n-   `Month::length` and `util::days_in_month`, replacing `util::days_in_year_month`.\n-   Expressions are permitted in `time::serde::format_description!` rather than only paths. This also\n    drastically improves diagnostics when an invalid value is provided.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   Obtaining the system UTC offset on Unix-like systems should now succeed when multi-threaded.\n    However, if the `TZ` environment variable is altered, the program will not be aware of this until\n    `time::util::refresh_tz` or `time::util::refresh_tz_unchecked` is called. `refresh_tz` has the\n    same soundness requirements as obtaining the system UTC offset previously did, with the\n    requirements still being automatically enforced. `refresh_tz_unchecked` does not enforce these\n    requirements at the expense of being `unsafe`. Most programs should not need to call either\n    function.\n\n    Due to this change, the `time::util::local_offset` module has been deprecated in its entirety. The\n    `get_soundness` and `set_soundness` functions are now no-ops.\n\n    Note that while calls *should* succeed, success is not guaranteed in any situation. Downstream\n    users should always be prepared to handle the error case.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Floating point values are truncated, not rounded, when formatting.\n-   RFC3339 allows arbitrary separators between the date and time components.\n-   Serialization of negative `Duration`s less than one second is now correct.

environment variable, similar to `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` but pointing directly to the manifest file.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14404/)\n-   [Added `package.autolib` to the

comment](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120736). This is similar to a third-party feature provided by the rustdoc-search-enhancements browser extension.\n\n<a id=\"1.83.0-Compatibility-Notes\"></a>\n\n## Compatibility Notes\n\n-   [Warn against function pointers using unsupported ABI strings.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128784)\n-   [Check well-formedness of the source type's signature in fn pointer casts.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129021) This partly closes a soundness hole that comes when casting a function item to function pointer\n-   [Use equality instead of subtyping when resolving type dependent paths.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129073)\n-   Linking on macOS now correctly includes Rust's default deployment target. Due to a linker bug, you might have to pass `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` or fix your `#[link]` attributes to point to the correct frameworks. See [#&#8203;129369](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129369).\n-   [Rust will now correctly raise an error for `repr(Rust)` written on non-`struct`/`enum`/`union` items, since it previous did not have any effect.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129422)\n-   The future incompatibility lint `deprecated_cfg_attr_crate_type_name` [has been made into a hard error](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129670). It was used to deny usage of `#![crate_type]` and `#![crate_name]` attributes in `#![cfg_attr]`, which required a hack in the compiler to be able to change the used crate type and crate name after cfg expansion.\n    Users can use `--crate-type` instead of `#![cfg_attr(..., crate_type = \"...\")]` and `--crate-name` instead of `#![cfg_attr(..., crate_name = \"...\")]` when running `rustc`/`cargo rustc` on the command line.\n    Use of those two attributes outside of `#![cfg_attr]` continue to be fully supported.\n-   Until now, paths into the sysroot were always prefixed with `/rustc/$hash` in diagnostics, codegen, backtrace, e.g.\n\n        thread 'main' panicked at 'hello world', map-panic.rs:2:50\n        stack backtrace:\n           0: std::panicking::begin_panic\n                     at /rustc/a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52/library/std/src/panicking.rs:616:12\n           1: map_panic::main::{{closure}}\n                     at ./map-panic.rs:2:50\n           2: core::option::Option<T>::map\n                     at /rustc/a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52/library/core/src/option.rs:929:29\n           3: map_panic::main\n                     at ./map-panic.rs:2:30\n           4: core::ops::function::FnOnce::call_once\n                     at /rustc/a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52/library/core/src/ops/function.rs:248:5\n        note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.\n\n    [RFC 3127 said](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3127-trim-paths.html#changing-handling-of-sysroot-path-in-rustc)\n\n    > We want to change this behaviour such that, when `rust-src` source files can be discovered, the virtual path is discarded and therefore the local path will be embedded, unless there is a `--remap-path-prefix` that causes this local path to be remapped in the usual way.\n\n    [#&#8203;129687](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/129687) implements this behaviour, when `rust-src` is present at compile time, `rustc` replaces `/rustc/$hash` with a real path into the local `rust-src` component with best effort.\n    To sanitize this, users must explicitly supply `--remap-path-prefix=<path to rust-src>=foo` or not have the `rust-src` component installed.\n-   The allow-by-default `missing_docs` lint used to disable itself when invoked through `rustc --test`/`cargo test`, resulting in `#[expect(missing_docs)]` emitting false positives due to the expectation being wrongly unfulfilled. This behavior [has now been removed](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130025), which allows `#[expect(missing_docs)]` to be fulfilled in all scenarios, but will also report new `missing_docs` diagnostics for publicly reachable `#[cfg(test)]` items, [integration test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#integration-tests) crate-level documentation, and publicly reachable items in integration tests.\n-   [The `armv8r-none-eabihf` target now uses the Armv8-R required set of floating-point features.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130295)\n-   [Fix a soundness bug where rustc wouldn't detect unconstrained higher-ranked lifetimes in a `dyn Trait`'s associated types that occur due to supertraits.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130367)\n-   [Update the minimum external LLVM version to 18.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130487)\n-   [Remove `aarch64-fuchsia` and `x86_64-fuchsia` target aliases in favor of `aarch64-unknown-fuchsia` and `x86_64-unknown-fuchsia` respectively.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130657)\n-   [The ABI-level exception class of a Rust panic is now encoded with native-endian bytes, so it is legible in hex dumps.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130897)\n-   [Visual Studio 2013 is no longer supported for MSVC targets.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131070)\n-   [The sysroot no longer contains the `std` dynamic library in its top-level `lib/` dir.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131188)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"* * * * *\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR is behind base branch, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR was generated by [Mend Renovate](https://mend.io/renovate/).

subcommand](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14141/)\n\n<a id=\"1.82.0-Compatibility-Notes\"></a>\n\n## Compatibility Notes\n\n-   We now [disallow setting some built-in cfgs via the command-line](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126158) with the newly added [`explicit_builtin_cfgs_in_flags`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#explicit-builtin-cfgs-in-flags) lint in order to prevent incoherent state, eg. `windows` cfg active but target is Linux based. The appropriate [`rustc` flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html) should be used instead.\n-   The standard library has a new implementation of `binary_search` which is significantly improves performance ([#&#8203;128254](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128254)). However when a sorted slice has multiple values which compare equal, the new implementation may select a different value among the equal ones than the old implementation.\n-   [illumos/Solaris now sets `MSG_NOSIGNAL` when writing to sockets](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128259). This avoids killing the process with SIGPIPE when writing to a closed socket, which matches the existing behavior on other UNIX targets.\n-   [Removes a problematic hack that always passed the --whole-archive linker flag for tests, which may cause linker errors for code accidentally relying on it.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128400)\n-   The WebAssembly target features `multivalue` and `reference-types` are now\n    both enabled by default. These two features both have subtle changes implied\n    for generated WebAssembly binaries. For the `multivalue` feature, WebAssembly\n    target support has changed when upgrading to LLVM 19. Support for generating\n    functions with multiple returns no longer works and\n    `-Ctarget-feature=+multivalue` has a different meaning than it did in LLVM 18\n    and prior. There is no longer any supported means to generate a module that has\n    a function with multiple returns in WebAssembly from Rust source code. For the\n    `reference-types` feature the encoding of immediates in the `call_indirect`, a\n    commonly used instruction by the WebAssembly backend, has changed. Validators\n    and parsers which don't understand the `reference-types` proposal will no\n    longer accept modules produced by LLVM due to this change in encoding of\n    immediates. Additionally these features being enabled are encoded in the\n    `target_features` custom section and may affect downstream tooling such as\n    `wasm-opt` consuming the module. Generating a WebAssembly module that disables\n    default features requires `-Zbuild-std` support from Cargo and more information\n    can be found at\n    [rust-lang/rust#128511](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128511).\n-   [Rust now raises unsafety errors for union patterns in parameter-position](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/130531)\n\n<a id=\"1.82.0-Internal-Changes\"></a>\n\n## Internal Changes\n\nThese changes do not affect any public interfaces of Rust, but they represent\nsignificant improvements to the performance or internals of rustc and related\ntools.\n\n-   [Update to LLVM 19](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/127513)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Both targets are the same, `wasm32-wasi` is only being renamed, and this [change to the WASI target](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/04/09/updates-to-rusts-wasi-targets.html) is being done to enable removing `wasm32-wasi` in January 2025.\n\n-   We have renamed `std::panic::PanicInfo` to `std::panic::PanicHookInfo`. The old name will continue to work as an alias, but will result in a deprecation warning starting in Rust 1.82.0.\n\n    `core::panic::PanicInfo` will remain unchanged, however, as this is now a *different type*.\n\n    The reason is that these types have different roles: `std::panic::PanicHookInfo` is the argument to the [panic hook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/panic/fn.set_hook.html) in std context (where panics can have an arbitrary payload), while `core::panic::PanicInfo` is the argument to the [`#[panic_handler]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/panic-handler.html) in no_std context (where panics always carry a formatted *message*). Separating these types allows us to add more useful methods to these types, such as `std::panic::PanicHookInfo::payload_as_str()` and `core::panic::PanicInfo::message()`.\n\n-   The new sort implementations may panic if a type's implementation of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) (or the given comparison function) does not implement a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order) as the trait requires. `Ord`'s supertraits (`PartialOrd`, `Eq`, and `PartialEq`) must also be consistent. The previous implementations would not \"notice\" any problem, but the new implementations have a good chance of detecting inconsistencies, throwing a panic rather than returning knowingly unsorted data.\n\n-   [In very rare cases, a change in the internal evaluation order of the trait\n    solver may result in new fatal overflow errors.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126128)\n\n<a id=\"1.81.0-Internal-Changes\"></a>\n\n## Internal Changes\n\nThese changes do not affect any public interfaces of Rust, but they represent\nsignificant improvements to the performance or internals of rustc and related\ntools.\n\n-   [Add a Rust-for Linux `auto` CI job to check kernel builds.](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125209/)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

this release, I am not planning to publish further versions of `serde_yaml` as none of my projects have been using YAML for a long time, so I have archived the GitHub repo and marked the crate deprecated in the version number.

It is recommended to use `std::time::Instant` directly, importing\n    `time::ext::InstantExt` for interoperability with `time::Duration`.\n-   `FormatItem` has been renamed to `BorrowedFormatItem`, avoiding confusion with `OwnedFormatItem`.\n    An alias has been added for backwards compatibility.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   The weekday is optional when parsing RFC2822.\n-   The range of sub-second values in `Duration` is documented correctly.

This is to support\n    the full POSIX range while permitting infallible negation.\n\n### [`v0.3.30`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0330-2023-10-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.29...v0.3.30)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `powerfmt::smart_display::SmartDisplay` has been added for the main types in the library. These\n    implementations ensure that values follow the requested fill, width, and alignment when using\n    `format!` or similar macros. `Display` is implemented in terms of `SmartDisplay`.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Large values no longer wrap around in release mode when using `NumericalDuration` or\n    `NumericalStdDuration`.\n\n### [`v0.3.29`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0329-2023-09-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.28...v0.3.29)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Niche value optimization for `Date` has been added. Both `Date` and `Option<Date>` are four bytes.\n-   Unit conversions have been added. It is now possible to write `Second::per(Day)`, which returns\n    the number of seconds in one day. See the types in the [`time::convert` module][time::convert module] for more\n    information.\n\n    [`time::convert` module]: https://time-rs.github.io/api/time/convert/index.html\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The diagnostic for `--cfg unsound_local_offset` has been removed.\n-   `#![feature(no_coverage)]` was previously used internally for code coverage. It is no longer used,\n    so it has been removed.\n-   The default value for `modifier::OffsetHour` has been changed. This was unintentionally changed in\n    v0.3.17 and went unnoticed until now. The sign is now only present if needed by default, as was\n    the case previously. This does not affect any situation where `format_description!` or\n    `format_description::parse` is used.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Adding or subtracting a `std::time::Duration` to/from an `OffsetDateTime` will not result in\n    integer overflow internally. It will still panic if the result is out of range.\n\n### [`v0.3.28`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0328-2023-08-27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.27...v0.3.28)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   More additional constants for the well-known `Iso8601` format description have been added. This\n    avoids the need to manually configure the format.\n-   An `[end]` component has been added. This is ignored during formatting, but is used to indicate\n    the end of input when parsing. If any input remains after this component, an error is returned.\n    This is useful when using the `[first]` component, as it avoids the need to reorder variants.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The exemption for MacOS introduced in 0.3.20 has been removed. This is because some supported\n    versions of MacOS do not meet the requirements for the exemption.\n-   The `UnexpectedTrailingCharacters` error variant has been moved to `ParseFromDescription`. All\n    previously-existing locations of this variant have been deprecated and will no longer be returned.\n\n### [`v0.3.27`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0327-2023-08-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.26...v0.3.27)\n\nThis sets the `serde` dependency requirement to `>= 1.0.184` where the binaries have been removed.\n\n### [`v0.3.26`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0326-2023-08-18)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.25...v0.3.26)\n\nThis release contains only a single change. `serde` is required to be a version prior to 1.0.171.\nThis is due to the decision by the maintainer of `serde` to include pre-built binaries that are\nexecuted without the end user's knowledge. As of the time of publishing, the included binary has not\neven been reproduced. This is a security risk, and the `time` project strongly opposes this\ndecision. While this may break some users' builds due to conflicting versions, it is a necessary\nstep to ensure the security.\n\n### [`v0.3.25`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0325-2023-08-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.24...v0.3.25)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Methods such as `Time::replace_milliseconds` would panic on some out-of-range values. This has\n    been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.3.24`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0324-2023-07-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.23...v0.3.24)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   The `subsecond` component is taken into account when parsing the `unix_timestamp` component. If\n    data is conflicting, the `subsecond` value takes precedence.\n-   Parsing a `Time` with only the `hour` component is now supported. The `minute` and `second`, and\n    `subsecond` components are assumed to be zero.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.67.0.\n-   The debug output for `Parsed` has been improved.\n-   When parsing, invalid values are now rejected sooner. Previously, the entire input would be parsed\n    before being rejected in the final step. Now, invalid values are rejected as soon as they are\n    encountered. This affects the error variant returned, which may cause minor breakage for any code\n    (incorrectly) relying on the exact error variant.\n-   When parsing a `Time`, an error is returned if components are present but not consecutive. For\n    example, if `hours` and `seconds` are present, `minutes` will not be assumed to be zero.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   The implementation of `Duration::checked_div` could return a slightly incorrect result in some\n    cases. This has been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.3.23`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0323-2023-07-08)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.22...v0.3.23)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `Date::next_occurrence`\n-   `Date::prev_occurrence`\n-   `Date::nth_next_occurrence`\n-   `Date::nth_prev_occurrence`\n-   `Weekday::nth_prev`\n-   `Month::nth_next`\n-   `Month::nth_prev`\n\n##### Changed\n\n**The minimum supported Rust version policy has been updated.** See [the README][msrv-policy] for\ndetails.\n\n[msrv-policy]: https://togithub.com/time-rs/time#minimum-rust-version-policy\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   `Duration::abs` correctly returns `Duration::MAX` when near the minimum value. The nanoseconds\n    value was previously incorrect.\n-   Compliance with ISO 8601 has been improved. Previously, a UTC offset would be incorrectly rejected\n    in some cases.\n\n### [`v0.3.22`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0322-2023-06-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.21...v0.3.22)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `OffsetDateTime::checked_to_offset`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>toml-rs/toml (toml)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.8.14`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.13...toml-v0.8.14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.13...toml-v0.8.14)\n\n### [`v0.8.13`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.12...toml-v0.8.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.12...toml-v0.8.13)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udc7b **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

The previous documentation\n    contained an off-by-one error.\n-   Leap seconds are now correctly handled when parsing ISO 8601.\n\n### [`v0.3.34`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0334-2024-02-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.33...v0.3.34)\n\n##### Fixed\n\nComputing the local offset on Windows works again. It was broken in some cases in v0.3.32 and\nv0.3.33.\n\n### [`v0.3.33`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0333-2024-02-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.32...v0.3.33)\n\n##### Fixed\n\nBuilds targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown` now work again.\n\n### [`v0.3.32`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0332-2024-02-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.31...v0.3.32)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Methods to replace the day of the year.\n    -   `Date::replace_ordinal`\n    -   `PrimitiveDateTime::replace_ordinal`\n    -   `OffsetDateTime::replace_ordinal`\n-   Modules to treat an `OffsetDateTime` as a Unix timestamp with subsecond precision for serde.\n    -   `time::serde::timestamp::milliseconds`\n    -   `time::serde::timestamp::microseconds`\n    -   `time::serde::timestamp::nanoseconds`\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   `Duration::time_fn` is deprecated.\n\n### [`v0.3.31`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0331-2023-12-19)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.30...v0.3.31)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `OffsetDateTime::new_in_offset`\n-   `OffsetDateTime::new_utc`\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The valid range of `UtcOffset` has been expanded from \u00b123:59:59 to \u00b125:59:59. This is to support\n    the full POSIX range while permitting infallible negation.\n\n### [`v0.3.30`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0330-2023-10-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.29...v0.3.30)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `powerfmt::smart_display::SmartDisplay` has been added for the main types in the library. These\n    implementations ensure that values follow the requested fill, width, and alignment when using\n    `format!` or similar macros. `Display` is implemented in terms of `SmartDisplay`.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Large values no longer wrap around in release mode when using `NumericalDuration` or\n    `NumericalStdDuration`.\n\n### [`v0.3.29`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0329-2023-09-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.28...v0.3.29)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Niche value optimization for `Date` has been added. Both `Date` and `Option<Date>` are four bytes.\n-   Unit conversions have been added. It is now possible to write `Second::per(Day)`, which returns\n    the number of seconds in one day. See the types in the [`time::convert` module][time::convert module] for more\n    information.\n\n    [`time::convert` module]: https://time-rs.github.io/api/time/convert/index.html\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The diagnostic for `--cfg unsound_local_offset` has been removed.\n-   `#![feature(no_coverage)]` was previously used internally for code coverage. It is no longer used,\n    so it has been removed.\n-   The default value for `modifier::OffsetHour` has been changed. This was unintentionally changed in\n    v0.3.17 and went unnoticed until now. The sign is now only present if needed by default, as was\n    the case previously. This does not affect any situation where `format_description!` or\n    `format_description::parse` is used.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Adding or subtracting a `std::time::Duration` to/from an `OffsetDateTime` will not result in\n    integer overflow internally. It will still panic if the result is out of range.\n\n### [`v0.3.28`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0328-2023-08-27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.27...v0.3.28)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   More additional constants for the well-known `Iso8601` format description have been added. This\n    avoids the need to manually configure the format.\n-   An `[end]` component has been added. This is ignored during formatting, but is used to indicate\n    the end of input when parsing. If any input remains after this component, an error is returned.\n    This is useful when using the `[first]` component, as it avoids the need to reorder variants.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The exemption for MacOS introduced in 0.3.20 has been removed. This is because some supported\n    versions of MacOS do not meet the requirements for the exemption.\n-   The `UnexpectedTrailingCharacters` error variant has been moved to `ParseFromDescription`. All\n    previously-existing locations of this variant have been deprecated and will no longer be returned.\n\n### [`v0.3.27`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0327-2023-08-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.26...v0.3.27)\n\nThis sets the `serde` dependency requirement to `>= 1.0.184` where the binaries have been removed.\n\n### [`v0.3.26`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0326-2023-08-18)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.25...v0.3.26)\n\nThis release contains only a single change. `serde` is required to be a version prior to 1.0.171.\nThis is due to the decision by the maintainer of `serde` to include pre-built binaries that are\nexecuted without the end user's knowledge. As of the time of publishing, the included binary has not\neven been reproduced. This is a security risk, and the `time` project strongly opposes this\ndecision. While this may break some users' builds due to conflicting versions, it is a necessary\nstep to ensure the security.\n\n### [`v0.3.25`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0325-2023-08-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.24...v0.3.25)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Methods such as `Time::replace_milliseconds` would panic on some out-of-range values. This has\n    been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.3.24`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0324-2023-07-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.23...v0.3.24)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   The `subsecond` component is taken into account when parsing the `unix_timestamp` component. If\n    data is conflicting, the `subsecond` value takes precedence.\n-   Parsing a `Time` with only the `hour` component is now supported. The `minute` and `second`, and\n    `subsecond` components are assumed to be zero.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.67.0.\n-   The debug output for `Parsed` has been improved.\n-   When parsing, invalid values are now rejected sooner. Previously, the entire input would be parsed\n    before being rejected in the final step. Now, invalid values are rejected as soon as they are\n    encountered. This affects the error variant returned, which may cause minor breakage for any code\n    (incorrectly) relying on the exact error variant.\n-   When parsing a `Time`, an error is returned if components are present but not consecutive. For\n    example, if `hours` and `seconds` are present, `minutes` will not be assumed to be zero.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   The implementation of `Duration::checked_div` could return a slightly incorrect result in some\n    cases. This has been fixed.\n\n### [`v0.3.23`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0323-2023-07-08)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.22...v0.3.23)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `Date::next_occurrence`\n-   `Date::prev_occurrence`\n-   `Date::nth_next_occurrence`\n-   `Date::nth_prev_occurrence`\n-   `Weekday::nth_prev`\n-   `Month::nth_next`\n-   `Month::nth_prev`\n\n##### Changed\n\n**The minimum supported Rust version policy has been updated.** See [the README][msrv-policy] for\ndetails.\n\n[msrv-policy]: https://togithub.com/time-rs/time#minimum-rust-version-policy\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   `Duration::abs` correctly returns `Duration::MAX` when near the minimum value. The nanoseconds\n    value was previously incorrect.\n-   Compliance with ISO 8601 has been improved. Previously, a UTC offset would be incorrectly rejected\n    in some cases.\n\n### [`v0.3.22`](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0322-2023-06-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.21...v0.3.22)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   `OffsetDateTime::checked_to_offset`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>toml-rs/toml \n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udc7b **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

Support for `rustc-serialize` will be [soft-destabilized in the next Rust edition](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116016). Removing the feature will not break existing users of the feature; Cargo will just not update dependents that rely on it to newer versions of chrono.\n\nIn chrono 0.4.36 we made an accidental breaking change by switching to `derive(Copy)` for `DateTime` instead of a manual implementation.

unexpected breaking change and was yanked. In it `LocalResult` was renamed to `MappedLocalTime` to avoid the impression that it is a `Result` type were some of the results are errors. For backwards compatibility a type alias with the old name was added.\n\nAs it turns out there is one case where a type alias behaves differently from the regular enum: you can't import enum variants from a type alias with `use chrono::LocalResult::*`. With 0.4.37 we make the new name `MappedLocalTime` the alias, but keep using it in function signatures and the documentation as much as possible.\n\nSee also the release notes of [chrono 0.4.36](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.36) from yesterday for the yanked release.\n\n### [`v0.4.36`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.36)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.35...v0.4.36)\n\nThis release un-deprecates the methods on `TimeDelta` that were deprecated with the 0.4.35 release because of the churn they are causing for the ecosystem.\n\nNew is the `DateTime::with_time()` method. As an example of when it is useful:\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::{Local, NaiveTime};\n// Today at 12:00:00\nlet today_noon = Local::now().with_time(NaiveTime::from_hms_opt(12, 0, 0).unwrap());\n```\n\n### Additions\n\n-   Add `DateTime::with_time()` ([#&#8203;1510](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1510))\n\n### Deprecations\n\n-   Revert `TimeDelta` deprecations ([#&#8203;1543](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1543))\n-   Deprecate `TimeStamp::timestamp_subsec_nanos`, which was missed in the 0.4.35 release ([#&#8203;1486](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1486))\n\n### Documentation\n\n-   Correct version number of deprecation notices ([#&#8203;1486](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1486))\n-   Fix some typos ([#&#8203;1505](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1505))\n-   Slightly improve serde documentation ([#&#8203;1519](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1519))\n-   Main documentation: simplify links and reflow text ([#&#8203;1535](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1535))\n\n### Internal\n\n-   CI: Lint benchmarks ([#&#8203;1489](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1489))\n-   Remove unnessary `Copy` and `Send` impls ([#&#8203;1492](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1492), thanks [@&#8203;erickt](https://togithub.com/erickt))\n-   Backport streamlined `NaiveDate` unit tests ([#&#8203;1500](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1500), thanks [@&#8203;Zomtir](https://togithub.com/Zomtir))\n-   Rename `LocalResult` to `TzResolution`, add alias ([#&#8203;1501](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1501))\n-   Update windows-bindgen to 0.55 ([#&#8203;1504](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1504))\n-   Avoid duplicate imports, which generate warnings on nightly ([#&#8203;1507](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1507))\n-   Add extra debug assertions to `NaiveDate::from_yof` ([#&#8203;1518](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1518))\n-   Some small simplifications to `DateTime::date_naive` and `NaiveDate::diff_months` ([#&#8203;1530](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1530))\n-   Remove `unwrap` in Unix `Local` type ([#&#8203;1533](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1533))\n-   Use different method to ignore feature-dependent doctests ([#&#8203;1534](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1534))\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n### [`v0.4.35`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.35)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.34...v0.4.35)\n\nMost of our efforts have shifted to improving the API for a 0.5 release, for which cleanups and refactorings are landing on the 0.4.x branch.\n\nThe most significant changes in this release are two sets of deprecations.\n\n-   We deprecated all timestamp-related methods on `NaiveDateTime`. The reason is that a timestamp is defined to be in UTC. The `NaiveDateTime` type doesn't know the offset from UTC, so it was technically wrong to have these methods. The alternative is to use the similar methods on the `DateTime<Utc>` type, or from the `TimeZone` trait.\n\n    Converting from `NaiveDateTime` to `DateTime<Utc>` is simple with `.and_utc()`, and in the other direction with `.naive_utc()`.\n\n-   The panicking constructors of `TimeDelta` (the new name of the `Duration` type) are deprecated. This was the last part of chrono that defaulted to panicking on error, dating from before rust 1.0.\n\n-   A nice change is that `NaiveDate` now includes a niche. So now `Option<NaiveDate>`, `Option<NaiveDateTime>` and `Option<DateTime<Tz>>` are the same size as their base types.\n\n-   `format::Numeric` and `format::Fixed` are marked as `non_exhaustive`. This will allow us to improve our formatting and parsing support, and we have reason to believe this breaking change will have little to no impact on users.\n\n### Additions\n\n-   Add `DateTime::{from_timestamp_micros, from_timestamp_nanos}` ([#&#8203;1234](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1234))\n-   Add getters to `Parsed` ([#&#8203;1465](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1465))\n\n### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate timestamp methods on `NaiveDateTime` ([#&#8203;1473](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1473))\n-   Deprecate panicking constructors of `TimeDelta` ([#&#8203;1450](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1450))\n\n### Changes/fixes\n\n-   Use `NonZeroI32` inside `NaiveDate` ([#&#8203;1207](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1207))\n-   Mark `format::Numeric` and `format::Fixed` as `non_exhaustive` ([#&#8203;1430](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1430))\n-   `Parsed` fixes to error values ([#&#8203;1439](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1439))\n-   Use `overflowing_naive_local` in `DateTime::checked_add*` ([#&#8203;1333](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1333))\n-   Do complete range checks in `Parsed::set_*` ([#&#8203;1465](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1465))\n\n### Documentation\n\n-   Rustfmt doctests ([#&#8203;1452](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1452))\n-   Improve docs for crate features ([#&#8203;1455](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1455), thanks [@&#8203;edmorley](https://togithub.com/edmorley))\n-   Add more documentation and examples to `Parsed` ([#&#8203;1439](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1439))\n\n### Internal\n\n-   Refactor `internals` module ([#&#8203;1428](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1428), [#&#8203;1429](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1429), [#&#8203;1431](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1431), [#&#8203;1432](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1432), [#&#8203;1433](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1433), [#&#8203;1438](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1438))\n-   CI: test cross-compiling to `x86_64-unknown-illumos` instead of Solaris ([#&#8203;1437](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1437))\n-   CI: lint Windows target, fix clippy warning ([#&#8203;1441](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1441))\n-   CI: only run `cargo hack check` on Linux ([#&#8203;1442](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1442))\n-   Update windows-bindgen to 0.54 ([#&#8203;1462](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1462), [#&#8203;1483](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1483))\n-   Simplify error value of `parse_internal` ([#&#8203;1459](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1459))\n-   Simplify `SerdeError` ([#&#8203;1458](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1458))\n-   Simplify `NaiveDate::from_isoywd` a bit ([#&#8203;1464](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1464))\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>assert-rs/trycmd (snapbox)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.5.9`](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.5.8...snapbox-v0.5.9)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.5.8...snapbox-v0.5.9)\n\n### [`v0.5.8`](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.5.7...snapbox-v0.5.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.5.7...snapbox-v0.5.8)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>toml-rs/toml (toml)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.8.12`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.11...toml-v0.8.12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.11...toml-v0.8.12)\n\n### [`v0.8.11`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.10...toml-v0.8.11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.10...toml-v0.8.11)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>BurntSushi/walkdir (walkdir)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.5.0`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.4.0...2.5.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.4.0...2.5.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udc7b **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

manual parsing of token trees in proc macro\n    code which expect a particular structure after `.to_string()`, rather than just arbitrary Rust code.\n-   [Make `IMPLIED_BOUNDS_ENTAILMENT` into a hard

Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.33...v0.4.34)\n\n### Notable changes\n\n-   In chrono 0.4.34 we finished the work to make all methods const where doing so is supported by rust 1.61.\n-   We renamed the `Duration` type to `TimeDelta`. This removes the confusion between chrono's type and the later `Duration` type in the standard library. It will remain available under the old name as a type alias for compatibility.\n-   The Windows implementation of `Local` is rewritten. The new version avoids panics when the date is outside of the range supported by windows (the years 1601 to 30828), and gives more accurate results during DST transitions.\n-   The `Display` format of `TimeDelta` is modified to conform better to ISO 8601. Previously it converted all values greater than 24 hours to a value with days. This is not correct, as doing so changes the duration from an 'accurate' to a 'nominal' representation to use ISO 8601 terms.\n\n### Fixes\n\n-   Add missing range check in `TimeDelta::milliseconds` ([#&#8203;1385](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1385), thanks [@&#8203;danwilliams](https://togithub.com/danwilliams))\n-   Remove check for `DurationExceedsTimestamp` in `DurationRound`

base implementation on `GetTimeZoneInformationForYear` ([#&#8203;1017](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1017))\n\n### Additions\n\n-   Add `TimeDelta::try_milliseconds` ([#&#8203;1385](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1385), thanks [@&#8203;danwilliams](https://togithub.com/danwilliams))\n-   Add `TimeDelta::new`

where possible ([#&#8203;1400](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1400))\n-   Make `Display` format of `TimeDelta` conform better to ISO 8601 ([#&#8203;1328](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1328))\n\n### Documentation\n\n-   Fix the formatting of `timestamp_micros`'s Example doc

docrs.rs build of [chrono 0.4.32](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.32).\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Make `rkyv` feature imply `size_32` ([#&#8203;1383](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1383))\n-   Fixed typo in `Duration::hours()` exception ([#&#8203;1384](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1384), thanks [@&#8203;danwilliams](https://togithub.com/danwilliams))\n\n### [`v0.4.32`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.32)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.31...v0.4.32)\n\nIn this release we shipped part of the effort to reduce the number of methods that could unexpectedly panic, notably for the `DateTime` and `Duration` types.\n\nChrono internally stores the value of a `DateTime` in UTC, and transparently converts it to the local value as required. For example adding a second to a `DateTime` needs to be done in UTC to get the correct result, but adding a day needs to be done in local time to be correct. What happens when the value is near the edge of the representable range, and the implicit conversions pushes it beyond the representable range? *Many* methods could panic on such inputs, including formatting the value for `Debug` output.\n\nIn chrono 0.4.32 the range of `NaiveDate`, `NaiveDateTime` and `DateTime` is made slightly smaller. This allows us to always do the implicit conversion, and in many cases return the expected result. Specifically the range is now from January 1, -262144 until December 31, 262143, one year less on both sides than before. We expect this may trip up tests if you hardcoded the `MIN` and `MAX` dates.\n\n`Duration` had a similar issue. The range of this type was pretty arbitrary picked to match the range of an `i64` in milliseconds. Negating an `i64::MIN` pushes a value out of range, and in the same way negating `Duration::MIN` could push it out of our defined range and cause a panic. This turns out to be somewhat common and hidden behind many layers of abstraction. We adjusted the type to have a minimum value of `-Duration::MAX` instead and prevent the panic case.\n\nOther highlights:\n\n-   `Duration` gained new fallible initialization methods.\n-   Better support for `rkyv`.\n-   Most methods on `NaiveDateTime` are now const.\n-   We had to bump our MSRV to 1.61 to keep building with our dependencies. This will also allow us to make more methods on `DateTime` const in a future release.\n\nComplete list of changes:\n\n#### Fixes\n\n-   Fix panic in `TimeZone::from_local_datetime`

some literal optimizations.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE 04f5d7be](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/04f5d7be4efc542864cc400f5d43fbea4eb9bab6):\n    Loosen ASCII-compatible rules such

Broader the reverse suffix optimization to apply in more cases.\n\n### [`v1.10.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1100-2023-10-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.6...1.10.0)\n\n\\===================\nThis is a new minor release of `regex` that adds support for start and end\nword boundary assertions. That is, `\\<` and `\\>`. The minimum supported Rust\nversion has also been raised to 1.65, which was released about one year ago.\n\nThe new word boundary assertions are:\n\n-   `\\<` or `\\b{start}`: a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the left,\n    `\\w` on the right).\n-   `\\>` or `\\b{end}`: a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\w` on the left, `\\W|\\z`\n    on the right)).\n-   `\\b{start-half}`: half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the\n    left).\n-   `\\b{end-half}`: half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\z` on the\n    right).\n\nThe `\\<` and `\\>` are GNU extensions to POSIX regexes. They have been added\nto the `regex` crate because they enjoy somewhat broad support in other regex\nengines as well (for example, vim). The `\\b{start}` and `\\b{end}` assertions\nare aliases for `\\<` and `\\>`, respectively.\n\nThe `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` assertions are not found in any\nother regex engine (although regex engines with general look-around support\ncan certainly express them). They were added principally to support the\nimplementation of word matching in grep programs, where one generally wants to\nbe a bit more flexible in what is considered a word boundary.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;469](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469):\n    Add support for `\\<` and `\\>` word boundary assertions.\n-   [FEATURE(regex-automata) #&#8203;1031](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1031):\n    DFAs now have a `start_state` method that doesn't use an `Input`.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1051](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1051):\n    Unicode character class operations have been optimized in `regex-syntax`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1090](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1090):\n    Make patterns containing lots of literal characters use less memory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1046](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1046):\n    Fix a bug that could result in incorrect match spans when using a Unicode word\n    boundary and searching non-ASCII strings.\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1047](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1047):\n    Fix panics that can occur in `Ast->Hir` translation (not reachable from `regex`\n    crate).\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1088](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1088):\n    Remove guarantees in the API that connect the `u` flag with a specific HIR\n    representation.\n\n`regex-automata` breaking change release:\n\nThis release includes a `regex-automata 0.4.0` breaking change release, which\nwas necessary in order to support the new word boundary assertions. For\nexample, the `Look` enum has new variants and the `LookSet` type now uses `u32`\ninstead of `u16` to represent a bitset of look-around assertions. These are\noverall very minor changes, and most users of `regex-automata` should be able\nto move to `0.4` from `0.3` without any changes at all.\n\n`regex-syntax` breaking change release:\n\nThis release also includes a `regex-syntax 0.8.0` breaking change release,\nwhich, like `regex-automata`, was necessary in order to support the new word\nboundary assertions. This release also includes some changes to the `Ast`\ntype to reduce heap usage in some cases. If you are using the `Ast` type\ndirectly, your code may require some minor modifications. Otherwise, users of\n`regex-syntax 0.7` should be able to migrate to `0.8` without any code changes.\n\n`regex-lite` release:\n\nThe `regex-lite 0.1.1` release contains support for the new word boundary\nassertions. There are no breaking changes.\n\n### [`v1.9.6`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#196-2023-09-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.5...1.9.6)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a panic that can occur when the default\nregex size limit is increased to a large number.\n\n-   [BUG aa4e4c71](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/aa4e4c7120b0090ce0624e3c42a2ed06dd8b918a):\n    Fix a bug where computing the maximum haystack length for the bounded\n    backtracker could result underflow and thus provoke a panic later in a search\n    due to a broken invariant.\n\n### [`v1.9.5`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#195-2023-09-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.4...1.9.5)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that hopefully mostly fixes a performance bug that\noccurs when sharing a regex across multiple threads.\n\nIssue [#&#8203;934](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/934)\nexplains this in more detail. It is [also noted in the crate\ndocumentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#sharing-a-regex-across-threads-can-result-in-contention).\nThe bug can appear when sharing a regex across multiple threads simultaneously,\nas might be the case when using a regex from a `OnceLock`, `lazy_static` or\nsimilar primitive. Usually high contention only results when using many threads\nto execute searches on small haystacks.\n\nOne can avoid the contention problem entirely through one of two methods.\nThe first is to use lower level APIs from `regex-automata` that require passing\nstate explicitly, such as [`meta::Regex::search_with`](https://docs.rs/regex-automata/latest/regex_automata/meta/struct.Regex.html#method.search_with).\nThe second is to clone a regex and send it to other threads explicitly. This\nwill not use any additional memory usage compared to sharing the regex. The\nonly downside of this approach is that it may be less convenient, for example,\nit won't work with things like `OnceLock` or `lazy_static` or `once_cell`.\n\nWith that said, as of this release, the contention performance problems have\nbeen greatly reduced. This was achieved by changing the free-list so that it\nwas sharded across threads, and that ensuring each sharded mutex occupies a\nsingle cache line to mitigate false sharing. So while contention may still\nimpact performance in some cases, it should be a lot better now.\n\nBecause of the changes to how the free-list works, please report any issues you\nfind with this release. That not only includes search time regressions but also\nsignificant regressions in memory usage. Reporting improvements is also welcome\nas well! If possible, provide a reproduction.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;934](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/934):\n    Fix a performance bug where high contention on a single regex led to massive\n    slow downs.\n\n### [`v1.9.4`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#194-2023-08-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.3...1.9.4)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where `RegexSet::is_match(..)` could\nincorrectly return false (even when `RegexSet::matches(..).matched_any()`\nreturns true).\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1070](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1070):\n    Fix a bug where a prefilter was incorrectly configured for a `RegexSet`.\n\n### [`v1.9.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#193-2023-08-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.2...1.9.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where some searches could result in\nincorrect match offsets being reported. It is difficult to characterize the\ntypes of regexes susceptible to this bug. They generally involve patterns\nthat contain no prefix or suffix literals, but have an inner literal along with\na regex prefix that can conditionally match.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1060](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1060):\n    Fix a bug with the reverse inner literal optimization reporting incorrect match\n    offsets.\n\n### [`v1.9.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#192-2023-08-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.1...1.9.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes another memory usage regression. This\nparticular regression occurred only when using a `RegexSet`. In some cases,\nmuch more heap memory (by one or two orders of magnitude) was allocated than in\nversions prior to 1.9.0.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1059](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059):\n    Fix a memory usage regression when using a `RegexSet`.\n\n### [`v1.9.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#191-2023-07-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.0...1.9.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release which fixes a memory usage regression. In the regex\n1.9 release, one of the internal engines used a more aggressive allocation\nstrategy than what was done previously. This patch release reverts to the\nprior on-demand strategy.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1027](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027):\n    Change the allocation strategy for the backtracker to be less aggressive.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>assert-rs/trycmd (snapbox)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.14`](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.4.13...snapbox-v0.4.14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.4.13...snapbox-v0.4.14)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>toml-rs/toml (toml)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.8.6`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.5...toml-v0.8.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.5...toml-v0.8.6)\n\n### [`v0.8.5`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.4...toml-v0.8.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.4...toml-v0.8.5)\n\n### [`v0.8.4`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.3...toml-v0.8.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.3...toml-v0.8.4)\n\n### [`v0.8.3`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.2...toml-v0.8.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.2...toml-v0.8.3)\n\n### [`v0.8.2`](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.1...toml-v0.8.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/toml-rs/toml/compare/toml-v0.8.1...toml-v0.8.2)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udc7b **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

[`v0.4.31`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.31): 0.4.31\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.30...v0.4.31)\n\nAnother maintenance release.\nIt was not a planned effort to improve our support for UNIX timestamps, yet most PRs seem related to this.\n\n##### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate `timestamp_nanos` in favor of the non-panicking `timestamp_nanos_opt` ([#&#8203;1275](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1275))\n\n##### Additions\n\n-   Add `DateTime::<Utc>::from_timestamp` ([#&#8203;1279](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1279), thanks [@&#8203;demurgos](https://togithub.com/demurgos))\n-   Add `TimeZone::timestamp_micros` ([#&#8203;1285](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1285), thanks [@&#8203;emikitas](https://togithub.com/emikitas))\n-   Add `DateTime<Tz>::timestamp_nanos_opt` and `NaiveDateTime::timestamp_nanos_opt` ([#&#8203;1275](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1275))\n-   Add `UNIX_EPOCH` constants ([#&#8203;1291](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1291))\n\n##### Fixes\n\n-   Format day of month in RFC 2822 without padding ([#&#8203;1272](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1272))\n-   Don't allow strange leap seconds which are not on a minute boundary initialization methods ([#&#8203;1283](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1283))\n    This makes many methods a little more strict:\n    -   `NaiveTime::from_hms_milli`\n    -   `NaiveTime::from_hms_milli_opt`\n

[`v0.4.30`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.30): 0.4.30\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.29...v0.4.30)\n\nIn this release, we have decided to swap out the `chrono::Duration` type (which has been a re-export of time 0.1 `Duration` type) with our own definition, which exposes a strict superset of the `time::Duration` API. This helps avoid warnings about the [CVE-2020-26235] and [RUSTSEC-2020-0071] advisories for downstream users and allows us to improve the `Duration` API going forward.\n\nWhile this is technically a SemVer-breaking change, we expect the risk of downstream users experiencing actual incompatibility to be exceedingly limited (see [our analysis](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1095#issuecomment-1571716955) of public code using a crater-like experiment), and not enough justification for the large ecosystem churn of a 0.5 release. If you have any feedback on these changes, please let us know in [#&#8203;1268](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1268).\n\n##### Additions\n\n-   Add `NaiveDate::leap_year` ([#&#8203;1261](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1261))\n\n##### Documentation\n\n-   Update main documentation from README ([#&#8203;1260](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1260), thanks [@&#8203;Stygmates](https://togithub.com/Stygmates))\n-   Add history of relation between chrono and time 0.1 to documentation ([https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1264](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1264), [https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1266](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1266))\n-   Clarify `Timelike::num_seconds_from_midnight` is a simple mapping ([#&#8203;1255](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1255))\n\n#### Relation between chrono and time 0.1\n\nRust first had a `time` module added to `std` in its 0.7 release. It later moved to `libextra`, and then to a `libtime` library shipped alongside the standard library. In 2014 work on chrono started in order to provide a full-featured date and time library in Rust. Some improvements from chrono made it into the standard library; notably, `chrono::Duration` was included as `std::time::Duration` ([rust#15934]) in 2014.\n\nIn preparation of Rust 1.0 at the end of 2014 `libtime` was moved out of the Rust distro and into the `time` crate to eventually be redesigned ([rust#18832], [rust#18858]), like the `num` and `rand` crates. Of course chrono kept its dependency on this `time` crate. `time` started re-exporting `std::time::Duration` during this period. Later, the standard library was changed to have a more limited unsigned `Duration` type ([rust#24920], [RFC 1040]), while the `time` crate kept the full functionality with `time::Duration`. `time::Duration` had been a part of chrono's public API.\n\nBy 2016 `time` 0.1 lived under the `rust-lang-deprecated` organisation and was not actively maintained ([time#136]). chrono absorbed the platform functionality and `Duration` type of the `time` crate in [chrono#478] (the work started in [chrono#286]). In order to preserve compatibility with downstream crates depending on `time` and `chrono` sharing a `Duration` type, chrono kept depending on time 0.1. chrono offered the option to opt out of the `time` dependency by disabling the `oldtime` feature (swapping it out for an effectively similar chrono type). In 2019, [@&#8203;jhpratt](https://togithub.com/jhpratt) took over maintenance on the `time` crate and released what amounts to a new crate as `time` 0.2.\n\n[rust#15934]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15934\n\n[rust#18832]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/18832#issuecomment-62448221\n\n[rust#18858]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/18858\n\n[rust#24920]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/24920\n\n[RFC 1040]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1040-duration-reform.html\n\n[time#136]: https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/issues/136\n\n[chrono#286]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/286\n\n[chrono#478]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/478\n\n##### Security advisories\n\nIn November of 2020 [CVE-2020-26235] and [RUSTSEC-2020-0071] were opened against the `time` crate. [@&#8203;quininer](https://togithub.com/quininer) had found that calls to `localtime_r` may be unsound ([chrono#499]). Eventually, almost a year later, this was also made into a security advisory against chrono as [RUSTSEC-2020-0159], which had platform code similar to `time`.\n\nOn Unix-like systems a process is given a timezone id or description via the `TZ` environment variable. We need this timezone data to calculate the current local time from a value that is in UTC, such as the time from the system clock. `time` 0.1 and chrono used the POSIX function `localtime_r` to do the conversion to local time, which reads the `TZ` variable.\n\nRust assumes the environment to be writable and uses locks to access it from multiple threads. Some other programming languages and libraries use similar locking strategies, but these are typically not shared across languages. More importantly, POSIX declares modifying the environment in a multi-threaded process as unsafe, and `getenv` in libc can't be changed to take a lock because it returns a pointer to the data (see [rust#27970] for more discussion).\n\nSince version 4.20 chrono no longer uses `localtime_r`, instead using Rust code to query the timezone (from the `TZ` variable or via `iana-time-zone` as a fallback) and work with data from the system timezone database directly. The code for this was forked from the [tz-rs crate] by [@&#8203;x-hgg-x](https://togithub.com/x-hgg-x). As such, chrono now respects the Rust lock when reading the `TZ` environment variable. In general, code should avoid modifying the environment.\n\n[CVE-2020-26235]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235\n\n[RUSTSEC-2020-0071]: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0071\n\n[chrono#499]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/499\n\n[RUSTSEC-2020-0159]: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159.html\n\n[rust#27970]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27970\n\n[chrono#677]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/677\n\n[tz-rs crate]: https://crates.io/crates/tz-rs\n\n##### Removing time 0.1\n\nBecause time 0.1 has been unmaintained for years, however, the security advisory mentioned above has not been addressed. While chrono maintainers were careful not to break backwards compatibility with the `time::Duration` type, there has been a long stream of issues from users inquiring about the time 0.1 dependency with the vulnerability. We investigated the potential breakage of removing the time 0.1 dependency in [chrono#1095] using a crater-like experiment and determined that the potential for breaking (public) dependencies is very low. We reached out to those few crates that did still depend on compatibility with time 0.1.\n\nAs such, for chrono 0.4.30 we have decided to swap out the time 0.1 `Duration` implementation for a local one that will offer a strict superset of the existing API going forward. This will prevent most downstream users from being affected by the security vulnerability in time 0.1 while minimizing the ecosystem impact of semver-incompatible version churn.\n\n[chrono#1095]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1095\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n### [`v0.4.29`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.29): 0.4.29\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.28...v0.4.29)\n\nThis release fixes a panic introduced in chrono 0.4.27 in `FromStr<DateTime<Utc>>` ([#&#8203;1253](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1253)).\n\nChrono now has a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/sXpav4PS7M).\n\n#### Fixes\n\n-   Fix arbitrary string slicing in `parse_rfc3339_relaxed` ([#&#8203;1254](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1254))\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate `TimeZone::datetime_from_str` ([#&#8203;1251](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1251))\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   Correct documentation for `FromStr` for `Weekday` and `Month` ([#&#8203;1226](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1226), thanks [@&#8203;wfraser](https://togithub.com/wfraser))\n\n#### Internal improvements\n\n-   Revert \"add test_issue\\_866\" ([#&#8203;1238](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1238))\n-   CI: run tests on `i686` and `wasm32-wasi` ([#&#8203;1237](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1237))\n-   CI: Include doctests for code coverage ([#&#8203;1248](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1248))\n-   Move benchmarks to a separate crate ([#&#8203;1243](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1243))\n    This allows us to upgrade the criterion dependency to 5.1 without changing our MSRV.\n-   Add Discord link to README ([#&#8203;1240](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1240), backported in [#&#8203;1256](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1256))\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>rust-cli/anstyle (colorchoice-clap)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.0.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/anstyle/compare/colorchoice-clap-v1.0.2...colorchoice-clap-v1.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/anstyle/compare/colorchoice-clap-v1.0.2...colorchoice-clap-v1.0.3)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>kornelski/deunicode (deunicode)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.4.0`](https://togithub.com/kornelski/deunicode/compare/v1.3.3...v1.4.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/kornelski/deunicode/compare/v1.3.3...v1.4.0)\n\n### [`v1.3.3`](https://togithub.com/kornelski/deunicode/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/kornelski/deunicode/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>assert-rs/trycmd (snapbox)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.13`](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.4.12...snapbox-v0.4.13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/assert-rs/trycmd/compare/snapbox-v0.4.12...snapbox-v0.4.13)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>BurntSushi/walkdir (walkdir)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.4.0`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.3...2.4.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.3...2.4.0)\n\n### [`v2.3.3`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.2...2.3.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.2...2.3.3)\n\n### [`v2.3.2`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.1...2.3.2)\n\n### [`v2.3.1`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.0...2.3.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/compare/2.3.0...2.3.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 5am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udc7b **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

improvements\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>chronotope/chrono (chrono)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.28`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.28): 0.4.28\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.27...v0.4.28)\n\nThis release fixes a test failure on 32-bit targets introduced with 0.4.27, see [https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1234](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1234).\n\n### [`v0.4.27`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.27): 0.4.27\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.26...v0.4.27)\n\nThis release bumps the MSRV from 1.56 to 1.57. This allows us to take advantage of the panicking in const feature. In this release most methods on `NaiveDate` and `NaiveTime` are made const, `NaiveDateTime` and others will follow in a later release.\n\nThe parser for the `%+` formatting specifier and the `RFC3339` formatting item is switched from a strict to a relaxed parser (see [https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1145](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1145)). This matches the existing documentation, and the parser used by `DateTime::from_str`. If you need to validate the input, consider using `DateTime::from_rfc3339`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate `DateTime::{from_local, from_utc}`

`ParseWeekdayError` and `ParseMonthError` ([https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/539](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/539), thanks [@&#8203;mike-kfed](https://togithub.com/mike-kfed))\n-   Make methods on `NaiveTime` const, update MSRV to 1.57

In the regex\n1.9 release, one of the internal engines used a more aggressive allocation\nstrategy than what was done previously. This patch release reverts to the\nprior on-demand strategy.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1027](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027):\n    Change the allocation strategy for the backtracker to be less aggressive.\n\n### [`v1.9.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#190-2023-07-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.4...1.9.0)\n\n\\==================\nThis release marks the end of a [years long rewrite of the regex crate\ninternals](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656). Since this is\nsuch a big release, please report any issues or regressions you find. We would\nalso love to hear about improvements as well.\n\nIn addition to many internal improvements that should hopefully result in\n\"my regex searches are faster,\" there have also been a few API additions:\n\n-   A new `Captures::extract` method for quickly accessing the substrings\n    that match each capture group in a regex.\n-   A new inline flag, `R`, which enables CRLF mode. This makes `.` match any\n    Unicode scalar value except for `\\r` and `\\n`, and also makes `(?m:^)` and\n    `(?m:$)` match after and before both `\\r` and `\\n`, respectively, but never\n    between a `\\r` and `\\n`.\n-   `RegexBuilder::line_terminator` was added to further customize the line\n    terminator used by `(?m:^)` and `(?m:$)` to be any arbitrary byte.\n-   The `std` Cargo feature is now actually optional. That is, the `regex` crate\n    can be used without the standard library.\n-   Because `regex 1.9` may make binary size and compile times even worse, a\n    new experimental crate called `regex-lite` has been published. It prioritizes\n    binary size and compile times over functionality (like Unicode) and\n    performance. It shares no code with the `regex` crate.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;244](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/244):\n    One can opt into CRLF mode via the `R` flag.\n    e.g., `(?mR:$)` matches just before `\\r\\n`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;259](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/259):\n    Multi-pattern searches with offsets can be done with `regex-automata 0.3`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;476](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/476):\n    `std` is now an optional feature. `regex` may be used with only `alloc`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;644](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/644):\n    `RegexBuilder::line_terminator` configures how `(?m:^)` and `(?m:$)` behave.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;675](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/675):\n    Anchored search APIs are now available in `regex-automata 0.3`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;824](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/824):\n    Add new `Captures::extract` method for easier capture group access.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;961](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/961):\n    Add `regex-lite` crate with smaller binary sizes and faster compile times.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;1022](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1022):\n    Add `TryFrom` implementations for the `Regex` type.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;68](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/68):\n    Added a one-pass DFA engine for faster capture group matching.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;510](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/510):\n    Inner literals are now used to accelerate searches, e.g., `\\w+@&#8203;\\w+` will scan\n    for `@`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;787](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/787),\n    [PERF #&#8203;891](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/891):\n    Makes literal optimizations apply to regexes of the form `\\b(foo|bar|quux)\\b`.\n\n(There are many more performance improvements as well, but not all of them have\nspecific issues devoted to them.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;429](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/429):\n    Fix matching bugs related to `\\B` and inconsistencies across internal engines.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;517](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/517):\n    Fix matching bug with capture groups.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;579](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/579):\n    Fix matching bug with word boundaries.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;779](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/779):\n    Fix bug where some regexes like `(re)+` were not equivalent to `(re)(re)*`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;850](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/850):\n    Fix matching bug inconsistency between NFA and DFA engines.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;921](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/921):\n    Fix matching bug where literal extraction got confused by `$`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;976](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/976):\n    Add documentation to replacement routines about dealing with fallibility.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1002](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1002):\n    Use corpus rejection in fuzz testing.\n\n### [`v1.8.4`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#184-2023-06-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.3...1.8.4)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where `(?-u:\\B)` was allowed in\nUnicode regexes, despite the fact that the current matching engines can report\nmatch offsets between the code units of a single UTF-8 encoded codepoint. That\nin turn means that match offsets that split a codepoint could be reported,\nwhich in turn results in panicking when one uses them to slice a `&str`.\n\nThis bug occurred in the transition to `regex 1.8` because the underlying\nsyntactical error that prevented this regex from compiling was intentionally\nremoved. That's because `(?-u:\\B)` will be permitted in Unicode regexes in\n`regex 1.9`, but the matching engines will guarantee to never report match\noffsets that split a codepoint. When the underlying syntactical error was\nremoved, no code was added to ensure that `(?-u:\\B)` didn't compile in the\n`regex 1.8` transition release. This release, `regex 1.8.4`, adds that code\nsuch that `Regex::new(r\"(?-u:\\B)\")` returns to the `regex <1.8` behavior of\nnot compiling. (A `bytes::Regex` can still of course compile it.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1006](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1006):\n    Fix a bug where `(?-u:\\B)` was allowed in Unicode regexes, and in turn could\n    lead to match offsets that split a codepoint in `&str`.\n\n### [`v1.8.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#183-2023-05-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.2...1.8.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where the regex would report a\nmatch at every position even when it shouldn't. This could occur in a very\nsmall subset of regexes, usually an alternation of simple literals that\nhave particular properties. (See the issue linked below for a more precise\ndescription.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;999](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999):\n    Fix a bug where a match at every position is erroneously reported.\n\n### [`v1.8.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#182-2023-05-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.1...1.8.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where regex compilation could panic\nin debug mode for regexes with large counted repetitions. For example,\n`a{2147483516}{2147483416}{5}` resulted in an integer overflow that wrapped\nin release mode but panicking in debug mode.

Specifically, the bug occurs when a pattern contains some\nliteral prefixes that could be extracted *and* an optional word boundary in the\nprefix.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;981](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/981):\n    Fix a bug where a word boundary could interact with prefix literal\n    optimizations and lead to a false positive match.\n\n### [`v1.8.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;180-2023-04-20)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a sizeable release that will be soon followed by another sizeable\nrelease. Both of them will combined close over 40 existing issues and PRs.\n\nThis first release, despite its size, essentially represents preparatory work\nfor the second release, which will be even bigger. Namely, this release:\n\n-   Increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.0, which was released about 1 year ago.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `aho-corasick` to the recently released 1.0\n    version.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `regex-syntax` to the simultaneously released\n    `0.7` version. The changes to `regex-syntax` principally revolve around a\n    rewrite of its literal extraction code and a number of simplifications and\n    optimizations to its high-level intermediate representation (HIR).\n\nThe second release, which will follow ~shortly after the release above, will\ncontain a soup-to-nuts rewrite of every regex engine. This will be done by\nbringing [`regex-automata`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata) into\nthis repository, and then changing the `regex` crate to be nothing but an API\nshim layer on top of `regex-automata`'s API.\n\nThese tandem releases are the culmination of about 3\nyears of on-and-off work that [began in earnest in March\n2020](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656).\n\nBecause of the scale of changes involved in these releases, I would love to\nhear about your experience. Especially if you notice undocumented changes in\nbehavior or performance changes (positive *or* negative).\n\nMost changes in the first release are listed below. For more details, please\nsee the commit log, which reflects a linear and decently documented history\nof all changes.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;501](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/501):\n    Permit many more characters to be escaped, even if they have no significance.\n    More specifically, any ASCII character except for `[0-9A-Za-z<>]` can now be\n    escaped. Also, a new routine, `is_escapeable_character`, has been added to\n    `regex-syntax` to query whether a character is escapeable or not.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/547):\n    Add `Regex::captures_at`. This filles a hole in the API, but doesn't otherwise\n    introduce any new expressive power.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;595](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/595):\n    Capture group names are now Unicode-aware. They can now begin with either a `_`\n    or any \"alphabetic\" codepoint. After the first codepoint, subsequent codepoints\n    can be any sequence of alpha-numeric codepoints, along with `_`, `.`, `[` and\n    `]`. Note that replacement syntax has not changed.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/810):\n    Add `Match::is_empty` and `Match::len` APIs.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/905):\n    Add an `impl Default for RegexSet`, with the default being the empty set.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;908](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/908):\n    A new method, `Regex::static_captures_len`, has been added which returns the\n    number of capture groups in the pattern if and only if every possible match\n    always contains the same number of matching groups.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;955](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/955):\n    Named captures can now be written as `(?<name>re)` in addition to\n    `(?P<name>re)`.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now supports empty character classes.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has an optional `std` feature. (This will come\n    to `regex` in the second release.)\n-   FEATURE: The `Hir` type in `regex-syntax` has had a number of simplifications\n    made to it.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` has support for a new `R` flag for enabling CRLF\n    mode. This will be supported in `regex` proper in the second release.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has proper support for \"regex that never\n    matches\" via `Hir::fail()`.\n-   FEATURE: The `hir::literal` module of `regex-syntax` has been completely\n    re-worked. It now has more documentation, examples and advice.\n-   FEATURE: The `allow_invalid_utf8` option in `regex-syntax` has been renamed\n    to `utf8`, and the meaning of the boolean has been flipped.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   PERF: The upgrade to `aho-corasick 1.0` may improve performance in some\n    cases. It's difficult to characterize exactly which patterns this might impact,\n    but if there are a small number of longish (>= 4 bytes) prefix literals, then\n    it might be faster than before.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;514](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/514):\n    Improve `Debug` impl for `Match` so that it doesn't show the entire haystack.\n-   BUGS [#&#8203;516](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/516),\n    [#&#8203;731](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/731):\n    Fix a number of issues with printing `Hir` values as regex patterns.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;610](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/610):\n    Add explicit example of `foo|bar` in the regex syntax docs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;625](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/625):\n    Clarify that `SetMatches::len` does not (regretably) refer to the number of\n    matches in the set.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;660](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/660):\n    Clarify \"verbose mode\" in regex syntax documentation.\n-   BUG [#&#8203;738](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/738),\n    [#&#8203;950](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/950):\n    Fix `CaptureLocations::get` so that it never panics.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;747](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/747):\n    Clarify documentation for `Regex::shortest_match`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;835](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/835):\n    Fix `\\p{Sc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Currency_Symbol}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;846](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/846):\n    Add more clarifying documentation to the `CompiledTooBig` error variant.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;854](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/854):\n    Clarify that `regex::Regex` searches as if the haystack is a sequence of\n    Unicode scalar values.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;884](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/884):\n    Replace `__Nonexhaustive` variants with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;893](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/893):\n    Optimize case folding since it can get quite slow in some pathological cases.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;895](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/895):\n    Reject `(?-u:\\W)` in `regex::Regex` APIs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;942](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/942):\n    Add a missing `void` keyword to indicate \"no parameters\" in C API.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;965](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/965):\n    Fix `\\p{Lc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Cased_Letter}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;975](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/975):\n    Clarify documentation for `\\pX` syntax.\n\n### [`v1.7.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;173-2023-03-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.2...1.7.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small release that fixes a bug in `Regex::shortest_match_at` that\ncould cause it to panic, even when the offset given is valid.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;969](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/969):\n    Fix a bug in how the reverse DFA was called for `Regex::shortest_match_at`.\n\n### [`v1.7.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;172-2023-03-21)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.1...1.7.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small release that fixes a failing test on FreeBSD.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;967](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/967):\n    Fix \"no stack overflow\" test which can fail due to the small stack size.\n\n### [`v1.7.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;171-2023-01-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.0...1.7.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis release was done principally to try and fix the doc.rs rendering for the\nregex crate.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;930](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/930):\n    Optimize `replacen`.

general problem. I'd like some feedback before I go further.\r\n\r\n# User facing problem\r\n\r\nIf you have a syntax error in the front matter of a post, the error message does not give you any hint which part might be wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding from `d:\\src\\awise.us\\input` into `E:\\externsrc\\cobalt.rs\\_site`\r\nError: Failed to parse posts/2005-10-24-starting-up.md\r\nInfo: caused by Failed to parse frontmatter\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the changes in this PR, a slightly more helpful error message is printed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding from `d:\\src\\awise.us\\input` into `E:\\externsrc\\cobalt.rs\\_site`\r\nError: Failed to parse posts/2005-10-24-starting-up.md\r\nInfo: caused by Failed to parse frontmatter\r\n\r\n\r\nInfo: caused by the 'offset minute' component could not be parsed\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see me fixing the problem with timezones in `published_date` in this commit: https://github.com/AustinWise/austinwise.github.com/commit/54f574916f0a8b7715f1bf49740088a8b1682424\r\n\r\n# Cause\r\n\r\nCobalt's `config` sub-crate uses the `status` crate for errors. The main Cobalt crate uses the `failure` crate for errors. When translating from `status::Status` to `failure::Error`, the `source` of `Status` is lost. This contains the lower level failure information, such as why parsing the front matter failed.\r\n\r\n# Possible solutions\r\n\r\nI can think of 3 possible solutions, the first of which I implemented in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Customize conversion from `status::Status` to `failure::Error`. I have implemented this in the PR for the one location that is effected by front matter parsing. Many other locations could potentially benefit from the extra source information.\r\n2. Define a custom error type for Cobalt instead of `failure::Error`. Define a `From` implementation that preserves the sources on a `status::Status`. I'm not sure how disruptive to programs that use Cobalt as a crate programmatically, but it would cover every occurrence of the problem.\r\n3. Unify the error type across all crates, instead of having to convert between `status::Status` to `failure::Error` at crate boundaries.\r\n\r\n# Where to go from here?\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to add a new error type to Cobalt to ensure that all lower-level errors are surfaced? Or are more targeted fixes desired.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure if there is a nicer way to implement these error structs.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/1127/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/1127/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/1126", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/1126/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/1126/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/1126/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/1126", "id": 1650227746, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAYrdfc5NZa7M", "number": 1126, "title": "chore(deps): update rust crate concolor to 0.1.1", "user": {"login": "renovate[bot]", "id": 29139614, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90MjkxMzk2MTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2740?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/renovate", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-01T01:18:15Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-03T15:21:39Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-03T15:21:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pulls/1126", "html_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/1126", "diff_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/1126.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/1126.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-03T15:21:38Z"}, "body": "[![Mend Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [concolor](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/concolor) | dependencies | minor | `0.0.12` -> `0.1.1` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rust-cli/concolor</summary>\n\n### [`v0.1.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/concolor/compare/concolor-v0.1.0...concolor-v0.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/concolor/compare/concolor-v0.1.0...concolor-v0.1.1)\n\n### [`v0.1.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/concolor/compare/concolor-v0.0.12...concolor-v0.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-cli/concolor/compare/concolor-v0.0.12...concolor-v0.1.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 3am on the first day of the month\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
