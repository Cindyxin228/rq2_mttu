Adds a new Pact Source to enable pact verification using the new \"pacts for verification\" endpoint (https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/issues/307)\r\n1. Pending pacts, WIP pacts and tags are now supported\r\n1. Updates the provider CLI with new these (and other) options (currently does not allow users to specific \"selectors\" via the CLI, this would be easily achieved after this PR is sorted), which uses the new source\r\n1. Adds basic environment variable support to the verifier to match the existing one\r\n\r\n**General comments:**\r\n* The code is still WIP and there are TODOs/Cleanups that need to happen (including moving to that streaming API where it makes sense). It does work though \ud83d\udc4d \r\n* I'd specifically created a new `PactSource` because I wasn't aware of any backwards compatibility issues by changing it. If we don't need that because the only public interface is the CLI, then I'll replace the old implementation instead\r\n* To pass the pending/verification notices to the actual verifier, I've threaded an optional `PactVerificationContext` which contains the notices alongside the Pacts and Pact source through the same process. As there are a few layers in which this passes, it's had an unfortunately side-effect of requiring a lot of functions to change. This probably also needs to be considered for backwards compatibility \r\n* There are a few places where duplication started appearing as a result of this (e.g. the CLI Main), I'll clean that up\r\n\r\nIf you have better/other ideas that I could try here, let me know (I considered a number of options, but they didn't feel right).\r\n\r\n**Areas I'd like some specific feedback/assistance on:**\r\n\r\n* Use of serde_json to serialise/deserialise the payloads. Dealing with the raw `serde_json::Value` was making this code very unreadable. Moving to to `serde_json::to_string` (and `from_value`) made this a lot nicer. Is there a reason this approach wasn't taken elsewhere?\r\n* Where to put things. The pact_broker.rs file is getting pretty big. Currently, I've just dumped some types in there along side the new implementation to fetch pacts. Let me know if you'd like it moved\r\n* Test approach: should we create a Pact test for this? :) Any other pointers? I've tried following previous \r\n* Code formatting: my editor badly wants to try and reformat the code, but doing so would have made this PR unreadable.

It should not be long. But I'm creating the PR anyway so that the essential parts can be reviewed.~~\r\n\r\nThe PR is now ready.\r\n\r\nLib upgrades:\r\n* Requires Rust 1.39.0 for async/await syntax\r\n* Upgrades tokio to 0.2\r\n* Upgrades hyper to 0.13\r\n* Upgrades reqwest to 0.10\r\n\r\nAPI breaking changes:\r\n~~`pact_consumer`: `trait StartMockServer` + `trait ValidatingMockServer`.~~\r\n\r\n~~I've tried my best to make consumer tests work nicely with the recently released `tokio-0.2`. As the mock server itself is implemented asynchronously, I feel that it's correct to publicly expose its async interface, and make it compatible with the `[tokio::test]` macro. An publicly asynchronous mock server needs to be shut down explicitly, which I tried to make clear in the docs.~~\r\n\r\nRemoved `StartMockServer::create_mock_server`\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any support for starting the `pact_consumer` mock server asynchronously. This idea of mine was flawed. It's now instead always run in a separate thread. Implementation inspired by https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/master/tests/support/server.rs.\r\n\r\nThis is good because it makes that API completely tokio-independent (no `async` functions exposed).\r\n\r\nFixes #51 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/55/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/55/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/53", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/53/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/53/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/53/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/53", "id": 524058936, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzQxOTA1OTU3", "number": 53, "title": "Update to Rust 2018 edition", "user": {"login": "audunhalland", "id": 5767935, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njc5MzU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5767935?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland", "html_url": "https://github.com/audunhalland", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/audunhalland/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2019-11-17T22:33:38Z", "updated_at": "2019-11-24T04:22:30Z", "closed_at": "2019-11-24T04:22:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pulls/53", "html_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/53", "diff_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/53.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/53.patch", "merged_at": "2019-11-24T04:22:30Z"}, "body": "The Rust 2018 edition removes the need to specify `extern crate`, and supports scoped macros, which I tend to like, especially for log statements: `log::info!(...)`.
