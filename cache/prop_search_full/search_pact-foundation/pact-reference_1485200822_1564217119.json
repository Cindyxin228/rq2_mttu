yet; it's intended to provide an opportunity for ongoing feedback.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains my various API experiments proposed in https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/17, plus a few other useful Rust tricks. I'm making an effort to keep each commit clear and independent, with a commit message describing the motivation by the change.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create a top-level cargo workspace allowing us to run `cargo test --all` across all crates.\r\n- [x] Make sure all the tests work.\r\n- [x] Make a compilable and runnable version of the `pact_consumer` doctest, so that we have a metric by which to evaluate the API simplicity (and a fully working example for people using the library).\r\n- [x] Remove the need to import `OptionalBody` directly.\r\n- [x] Replace the `s!` macro with `Into<String>`.\r\n- [x] Remove the need to pass hash tables to `headers` and `query`.\r\n- [x] Figure out if we can avoid the need to wrap things in `OptionalBody`.\r\n- [x] Think about the internal state machine, and whether or not it would be worth exposing this as part of the API types. (Diesel does something similar.) This interacts with the \"builder\" pattern in some important ways, though. (Don't worry, I'll explain this later!)\r\n- [x] Provide an `Into<PactPattern>` interface (or something with a similar name), which allows the mixing of `String`, `&str`, `Regex`, `like(...)`, `serde_json::Value`, etc., when building interactions.\r\n- [x] Experiment with some new ideas for the running & validation APIs.\r\n- [x] Port unit tests elsewhere in the tree to the new API.\r\n\r\nOutstanding API questions:\r\n\r\n- [x] Do we want separate `StringPattern` and `JsonPattern` types? This would make it much easier to add `XmlPattern` someday. But it may add more complexity than we want. Experimentation required.\r\n- [x] Q: Can we avoid needing to write `SomethingLike::new(json_pattern!(\"Archimedes\"))` by using `Into` _without_ making it impossible to add `StringPattern` later? A: No.\r\n- [x] What should we do about multiple values for a `query_param`? Getting a clean API for this with no hacks probably requires a bit of thought.\r\n- [x] Add a `pact_term!` macro.\r\n- [x] Add explicit support for `something_like` and `array_like` to the `json_pattern!` syntax.\r\n- [x] Add a `url_for(\"/users/12\")` method that calls `join` and `expect` with a relative path.\r\n- [x] Add helpers like `content_type`, `json`, `not_found`, `created`, etc.\r\n- [x] Q: Should we shorten the name of `json_pattern!` to something like `json_pat!`? A: Probably not.\r\n- [x] Q: Should we rename `array_like!` (matches Ruby) to `each_like!` (matches JavaScript)? What about `something_like!` to `like!`?\r\n- [x] Q: Do regex expressions all need `^` and `$`, or is that supplied by Ruby? A: Required on the Rust side.\r\n- [x] Can we add `min` to the `array_like!` macro without too much messing around?\r\n- [x] Add `charset=utf-8` (with case insensitive regex) to default JSON header.\r\n- [x] Add helper to strip null object fields from `serde_json::Value`.\r\n- [x] Figure out what's going on in the Ruby code, especially re: `min` and `match`.\r\n- [x] ~~Add output directory configuration.~~ Will move to another PR.\r\n- [x] Spent 10 Oct 2017 writing code against this API, fix any remaining issues, and submit this PR by EOD.\r\n\r\nOther cleanup:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a helper method for `.get_or_insert_with(Default::default)`, and clean up everywhere.\r\n- [x] Add an example testing with a domain object serialized to JSON.\r\n- [x] Update top-level crate documentation to contain a brief explanation of what Pact is and why it's cool, for people who discover this crate at http://docs.rs/pact_consumer/\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/18/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/18/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/16", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/16/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/16/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/16/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/16", "id": 258644813, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQxNzIyMjc4", "number": 16, "title": "Add a Gitter chat badge to README.md", "user": {"login": "gitter-badger", "id": 8518239, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTgyMzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8518239?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger", "html_url": "https://github.com/gitter-badger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gitter-badger/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2017-09-18T22:51:43Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-18T22:52:22Z", "closed_at": "2017-09-18T22:52:22Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pulls/16", "html_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/16", "diff_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/16.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/16.patch", "merged_at": "2017-09-18T22:52:22Z"}, "body": "### pact-foundation/pact-reference now has a Chat Room on Gitter\n\n@uglyog has just created a chat room.
