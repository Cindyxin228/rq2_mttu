The current state of this branch is\r\nthat all unit tests except backup are passing. Backup needs to be\r\nupdated with how to handle the transaction log.\r\n\r\nMost of the refactor in this change is switching from a single Roots\r\ninstance to multiple instances. This is how BonsaiDb used to be\r\nstructured with multiple instances of Sled, but I switched away from\r\nthat method to minimize the issues with multiple caches and not being\r\nable to control the number of background processes sled was using.\r\n\r\nSince I'm in control of Nebari, I just added the support necessary to\r\nshare thread pools and file managers. To avoid issues with Database and\r\nStorage keeping each other alive, the Context type is used to share\r\nRoots instances between Database instances.\r\n\r\n- [x] ~Re-implement transaction log backup~ Bad idea -- Nebari creates a new transaction log history when importing the data. I can't think of a valid reason to keep the transaction log data in a restore situation -- the transaction log data is primarily for replication, and if you're using replication, there's no reason to do a restore from backup -- you'd swap over to the replica or restore from the replica using replication, not this backup process.\r\n- [x] Store executed transactions directly in Nebari (needs

We will have simple, easy to understand documentation about this before long, but the summary is that the password for the users will be encrypted on the client before being sent to the server, and the server has no way of knowing the original password. Yet, it can be confident on a subsequent login that the password provided is the same with additional validations being able to be done on the client if state is able to be saved. tl;dr: what's better than storing salted+hashed passwords?
