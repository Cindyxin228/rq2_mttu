That may have been ok-ish for internal use, but I had to make the method public so we can probably use an enum there?\r\n- The IO trait may benefit of being extended with an `add_event` function. Right now, the trait it has just ui_scale and resolution methods. This also means getting an thyme::Event exposed (that's not the winit one).\r\n- Would be good to drop the reliance on geometry shaders so we could emit vertices on the CPU (in that way we can emmit them regardless of the backend. e.g. as all graphics APIs are public and geometry shaders are problematic http://www.joshbarczak.com/blog/?p=667 and https://static.docs.arm.com/100019/0100/arm_mali_application_developer_best_practices_developer_guide_100019_0100_00_en2.pdf see chapter on avoiding geom. shaders on page 19).
