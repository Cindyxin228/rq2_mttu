For example, if throttling occurs while trying to publish aws-smithy-query, then `publisher publish --continue-from aws-smithy-query` can be run to resume from where it left off.\r\n\r\nBy submitting

It has two subcommands:\r\n\r\n- `fix-manifests`: This is to be run after importing the latest generated code from smithy-rs. It will add versions to all path dependencies for all crates.\r\n- `publish`: This will be run when ready to actually publish to crates.io. It figures out the correct order to publish the crates in, chunks them into batches, and runs them with some throttled concurrency. It currently doesn't retry on failure, but this can be added later.\r\n\r\nI tested everything works correctly except for the final publish, which, can't be tested until we actually publish. Doing a dry-run publish succeeds for the first few crates that don't have any path dependencies.\r\n\r\nSample output of the publish command:\r\n```\r\nOct 12 18:44:08.509  INFO publisher::subcommand::publish: Discovering crates to publish...\r\nOct 12 18:44:09.432  INFO publisher::subcommand::publish: Crates discovered.\r\nPublish plan:\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/protocol-test-helpers\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-async\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-types\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-eventstream\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-sigv4\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-types\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-http\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-http-tower\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-json\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-query\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-xml\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-endpoint\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-auth\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-http\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/smithy-client\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-sig-auth\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-hyper\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/sts\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  wait\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/aws-config\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/accessanalyzer\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/account\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/acm\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/acmpca\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/alexaforbusiness\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/amp\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/amplify\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/amplifybackend\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/apigateway\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/apigatewaymanagement\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/apigatewayv2\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/appconfig\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/appflow\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/appintegrations\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/applicationautoscaling\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/applicationcostprofiler\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/applicationdiscovery\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/applicationinsights\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/appmesh\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/apprunner\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/appstream\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/appsync\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n  [in \"/home/jdisanti/src/aws-sdk-rust/sdk/athena\"]: cargo publish --dry-run\r\n\r\n... snip ...\r\n\r\nContinuing will publish to crates.io.
