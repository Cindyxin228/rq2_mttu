to release SDKs for those services. However, after we've automated the model update process, we realize that some of the model filenames are not in sync with our automation tool, creating two different files for the same service ([example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/pull/1019)).\r\n\r\nThis PR does a full audit to make model filenames in sync with our automaton tool. I wrote a small script that does the renaming and the following script log should explain why changed files in the PR are the way they are.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>full log of running a rename
