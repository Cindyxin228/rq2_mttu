But\r\nif someone has stored a waker for a task, it's still valid for them to\r\ninvoke the waker even though the corresponding task has finished (the\r\nfutures API doesn't give them a way to check). For example, the\r\n`futures` implementation of `mpsc` can try to wake the receiver when\r\ndropping a sender, even if the receiver task has already gone away. So\r\nwe need to not resurrect a task that has already finished if its waker\r\nis later invoked. In fact, a task in Finished state should never change\r\nstates again, so I added assertions preventing that.\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter your PR description here -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/shuttle/issues/12/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/shuttle/issues/12/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
