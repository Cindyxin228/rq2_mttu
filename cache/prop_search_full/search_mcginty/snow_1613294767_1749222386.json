RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/tree/master/p256). This is a pure-Rust implementation.\r\n* As per feedback in previous abandoned PR https://github.com/mcginty/snow/pull/38#issuecomment-435416354, the code is feature gated, as this is a non-standard curve.\r\n* Includes PR #181 which updates curve25519-dalek, which unbreaks the build for me.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis curve is used for the Noise handshake in [CTAP2 Hybrid Transport](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.2-rd-20230321/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.2-rd-20230321.html#hybrid-qr-initiated). This is the protocol used for browsers to access FIDO2 credentials (aka Passkeys) on roaming authenticators connected over the internet, such as phones running Android and iOS. \r\n\r\nI'm using snow in my implementation of CTAP2, aimed at bringing Passkeys to the Linux desktop, see [xdg-credentials-portal](https://github.com/AlfioEmanueleFresta/xdg-credentials-portal).\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nAll
