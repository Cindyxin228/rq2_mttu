PKGBUILD available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=lowcharts).\r\n- [lowcharts-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lowcharts-bin) --> Bin package installed from the pre-compiled binaries from the latest release of the GitHub repo. PKGBUILD available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=lowcharts-bin).\r\n- [lowcharts-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lowcharts-git) --> VCS package compiled from the latest commit of the GitHub repo (and not from the latest release). PKGBUILD available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=lowcharts-git).\r\n\r\nI'm obviously down to maintain them on the AUR for all the future updates `lowcharts` will get !\r\n\r\nIf that's okay for you, I modified the README of the Github repo to let people know that `lowcharts` is now available on the AUR as well (hence this PR).\r\nIf you want me to make some changes to that PR, feel free to ask (for instance, if you don't want to consider the AUR as an official source of installation and you want it to be tagged as such in the README).\r\nAlso, if you don't want to promote this installation method at all for some reason, I'll understand if you reject my PR ;)\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to reach me if you need more info.\r\nOnce again, thanks for your work !\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\nWhile talking about the AUR `lowcharts` packages: I have a suggestion to make about the content of the pre-compiled binary archives that would facilitate the maintenance of the [lowcharts-bin]( https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lowcharts-bin) AUR package on my side and would also respects best practices. I'll open a specific issue for that, so we can discuss it there ;)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/juan-leon/lowcharts/issues/3/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/juan-leon/lowcharts/issues/3/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
