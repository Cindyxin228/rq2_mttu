The goal is thus:\r\n\r\nSynchronous database pool and connection usage, *including* creation, usage, and `Drop`, should always be done inside some kind of \"blocking-safe\" environment. Since #1375 databases use `spawn_blocking`; alternatives include `block_in_place` (risky) or a dedicated thread with message passing to communicate between the async and sync code (safer, but probably not better than the status quo in terms of complexity to implement maintain or troubleshoot and likely still pretty bad ergonomically).\r\n\r\nThis problem is now addressed by starting the database pool inside a `spawn_blocking` closure. Usage of the database pool (i.e. acquiring connections) was already wrapped, along with usage of the connections themselves. This leaves `Drop`, which was also already wrapped properly -- aside from a race condition between server shutdown and handlers that were still running, which was recently fixed in e1307dd.",
