Since the 2018-12-28 nightly, `FooX: UriDisplay<Path>` failing to be implemented shows up again as unsatisfied trait bounds for the implementation of `FromUriParam`. I'm not thrilled with the current error output but wanted to at least ensure it passes the CI with this change.\r\n\r\nOne possible fix would be to add a trivial where constraint (`impl FromUriParam<...> for &Foo1 where Foo1: UriDisplay<...>`), but that feels inappropriate as a way to fix error messages and requires use of another unstable feature.", "reactions": {"url":
