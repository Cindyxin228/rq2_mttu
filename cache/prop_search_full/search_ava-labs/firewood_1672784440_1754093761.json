However, neither are in use and created confusion with the other Proposal object. So, they were removed as part of unwrapping the Arc around proposals.\r\n\r\nA nit change also was to give names to all of the lifetimes in the proposal and db traits.

This is convenient for all of the places where we represent the children of a branch node in the trie.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a method to construct the array in const context, allowing for easy creation of `Children<T>` instances.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most controversial in this change will be the changes to `children_addresses` and `children_hashes`. Instead of returning an iterator, they instead return the array of requested values. The implementation of this is also of particular note because I `zip` over an `iter_mut` preventing the need for any array indexing like was previously used to construct these arrays.\r\n\r\nThis change was primarily motivated by my range proof verification work. I was touching code that indicated differences with branch_factor_256, so I expanded my clippy checks to ensure that the code compiles with the feature enabled and discovered that it didn't unrelated to my changes. The `Default::default()` calls work for the children array when `branch_factor_256` is disabled because rust stdlib has an [implementation for arrays of up to 32 elements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html#:~:text=Arrays%20of%20sizes,to%20size%2032.).

"feat(deferred-allocate): Part 3: Defer allocate\r\n\r\nThis implements deferred allocaion that delays allocating space for\r\nnodes until commit time.\r\n\r\nThe nodestore refactor consisted of removing the 'new' hashmap, which\r\nmapped newly allocated nodes to their contents in a proposal. Instead,\r\nnow we store those newly allocated nodes directly from the `Child`\r\nstruct.\r\n\r\nThe implementation constisted of:\r\n - A new type, NodeAllocator, to consolidate all the allocation code\r\n - Removing the 'new' hashmap, as freshly allocatred nodes are found\r\n   by traversing the trie and inspecting their state\r\n - Use the most recently committed revision's freelist to allocate\r\n   new nodes. This will change in a future revision when the freelist\r\n   is tied to storage rather than the revision.\r\n - Rewrite flush_nodes to serialize then allocate. Previously, the node\r\n   was serialized twice, once to determine the size during proposal\r\n   creation (allocation time) and once to store it\r\n - Changes to the commit flow by separating the node persistence logic\r\n   (see comments in commit.rs)\r\n\r\nSome miscellaneous changes included in this diff (could be split out):\r\n - Branch children iterators can no longer return reference to hashes,\r\n   since they are sometimes behind an ArcSwap\r\n - Propogate logger feature in fwdctl (helped with debugging)\r\n - Remove use of stored_len in tests\r\n - size_from_area_index was a method on nodestore, but didn't use\r\n   nodestore\r\n - uncached_node_and_size was dead code\r\n - New clippy lint for hash_helper not needing &self in non-ethhash\r\n   fixed\r\n\r\nTask completion status:\r\n  [x] Roots may not be persisted (Part 1: #1041)\r\n  [x] BranchNode children can now be Node, LinearAddress or a\r\nMaybePersistedNode (Part 2: #1045 and #1047)\r\n  [x] When converting a `MutableProposal` to an `ImmutableProposal`,\r\ndon't actually allocate space, just create `SharedNode`s from the\r\n`Node`s. (Part 3: #1055 and this PR)\r\n  [ ] Remove `NodeStoreHeader` from `NodeStore`. The header should move\r\ninto the `RevisionManager`.\r\n  [ ] Allocate new nodes from the recently-freed nodes from an expired\r\nrevision, then from the freelist. This can be done by maintaining a\r\nlocal freelist from the nodes deleted in the expiring revision and\r\nfalling back to the actual freelist. Deleted nodes that are not reused\r\nmust still be pushed onto the freelist.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1061/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1061/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1060", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1060/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1060/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1060/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1060", "id": 3230265452, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJV-Kkc6e4ggc", "number": 1060, "title": "feat(deferred-allocate): UnpersistedIterator", "user": {"login": "rkuris", "id": 3193068, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTMwNjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193068?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris", "html_url": "https://github.com/rkuris", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuris/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-07-14T23:12:20Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-16T18:19:45Z", "closed_at": "2025-07-16T18:19:43Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/pulls/1060", "html_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1060", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1060.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1060.patch", "merged_at": "2025-07-16T18:19:43Z"}, "body": "An UnpersistedIterator iterates through a NodeStore looking for unpersisted nodes.

If this area is allocated for a trie node, the root or the parent trie node will be returned. If this area is free, the free list head or the parent of this free area is returned. We return the parent because, if we were to fix the misalignment issue (by migrating to another area or remove it from the free list), the parent pointer needs to be updated accordingly. \r\n\r\nAs a side effect, `FreeListIterator` will return the parent of the free list item. This design can help checker fix various issues it sees when traversing the free list but will add some overhead if it is used for other purposes.

I also removed the metrics field from `CreateOrOpenArgs`.\r\n\r\nGiven that starting the metrics exporter is now a separate function call, I also removed the special case of not starting the metrics exporter for when `metrics_port = 0`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test for starting up the metrics server and querying it.", "reactions": {"url":
