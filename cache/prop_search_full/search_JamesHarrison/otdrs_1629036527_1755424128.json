It introduces two new methods on the `SORFile` object:\n\n- `to_bytes()`: Serializes the `SORFile` object into a Python `bytes` object.\n- `write_file(path)`: Writes the serialized `SORFile` to a file on disk.\n\nThis functionality is crucial for users who want to programmatically modify SOR files and save their changes.\n\nThe implementation exposes the existing Rust-based serialization functionality to the Python bindings. A comprehensive round-trip test suite has been added to ensure that files can be read, written, and read back without data loss.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/JamesHarrison/otdrs/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/JamesHarrison/otdrs/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
