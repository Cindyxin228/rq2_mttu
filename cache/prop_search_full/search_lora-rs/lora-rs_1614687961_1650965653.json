more clearly in the radio API:\r\n\r\n* The TX buffer is now passed as a [u8] slice rather than using the\r\n  associated radio type.

It also now only has\r\n  read access to the TX buffer.\r\n* The RX buffer is accessed by lorawan-device after an RxDone event, in\r\n  which case it really only needs a &mut [u8] to parse the packet, and\r\n  -device doesn't really change at all.\r\n* Introduce a RadioBuffer type thats used internally to wrap the\r\n  provided TX buffer slice, with a way to conveniently append to the\r\n  buffer.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of lifetime arguments being added, in order to allow the\r\nTX buffer to be provided externally. I believe this will be useful in order to fix get_random to use \r\nproper traits as well. There are some important performance benefits from these changes:\r\n\r\n* TX buffer allocation can be done externally to lorawan-device,\r\n  which is crucial for keeping async future stack usage down because the\r\n  size of the buffer will not impact the stack anymore.\r\n* Radio implementations are now free to decide how the RX buffer is\r\n  managed as well, for the same reasons as above.\r\n\r\nAlthough I would ideally like TX and RX to share buffer, I think that would better come in a later PR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/issues/42/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/issues/42/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/issues/40", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/issues/40/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/issues/40/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/issues/40/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs/pull/40", "id": 933034578, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjgwMzA0MDYw", "number": 40, "title": "ABP support", "user": {"login": "lthiery", "id": 1606640, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY2NDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606640?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery", "html_url": "https://github.com/lthiery", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lthiery/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2021-06-29T19:22:21Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-17T22:58:41Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-17T05:58:32Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lora-rs/lora-rs/pulls/40", "html_url": "https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs/pull/40", "diff_url": "https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs/pull/40.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs/pull/40.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-17T05:58:32Z"}, "body": "Implements support for Activation by Personalization (ABP).
