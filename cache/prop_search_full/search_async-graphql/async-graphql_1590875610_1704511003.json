#1361 \r\n\r\nHeya :wave:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for defining entities without a reference resolver using the [`resolvable` parameter of the `@key` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#key) on the `SimpleObject` and `Object` macros.\r\n\r\nThe key to be marked unresolvable can be either implicitly (`#[graphql(unresolvable)]`) or explicitly (`#[graphql(unresolvable = \"<key>\")]`) defined. When implicitly defined, the macro assumes all non-skipped fields are part of the key. When explicitly defined, the macro assumes the provided key is valid for the object.

\ud83d\udc4b \r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the [`@interfaceObject` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/interfaces) on the `SimpleObject`, `Object` and `MergedObject` macros.\r\n\r\nExample usage in Rust:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(SimpleObject)]\r\n#[graphql(interface_object)] // <-- New attribute\r\nstruct MyInterfaceObject {\r\n    pub id: u64,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGraphQL schema generated by the above example:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n#                                         v-- New directive\r\ntype MyInterfaceObject @key(fields: \"id\") @interfaceObject {\r\n    id: Int!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `@interfaceObject` directive is supported since Federation v2.3, so I had to also update the referenced Federation version used in the `@link` directives when exporting the schema, according to the [Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/interfaces#enabling-support). **I am not sure whether this is a breaking change or not!** I couldn't find any information in the official docs, but it probably is.\r\n\r\nCloses #1238.", "reactions": {"url":

`async_graphql` supports only \"execution\" type directives (which can be specified on query fields) and provided function is called during query execution.\r\n\r\nThere is another type of directives supported by grapqhl spec - type system directives, which simply acts like type level decorators http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#TypeSystemDirectiveLocation\r\n\r\nAlthough those type of directives doesn't (and shouldn't) alter the behaviour of library itself, but its a powerful tool to communicate additional metadata to schema introspectors and with @composeDirective support, it can be used in various ways to communicate meta type info to supergraph routers etc.\r\n\r\nThe alternative way would be reuse already available @tag directives, limitation being that the value of tag is just a string which lacks further syntax check etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes new proc macro `TypeDirective` which is similar to currently implemented `Directive` and is also is applied to rust functions. The difference is that function is used to generate arguments for directive definition, and later can be called on graphql construct to generate actual directive \"invocation\". Example:\r\n```rust\r\n    #[TypeDirective(\r\n        location = \"fielddefinition\",\r\n        location = \"object\",\r\n    )]\r\n    fn testDirective(scope: String, input: u32, opt: Option<u64>) {}\r\n```\r\nwill result in following defintion on generated SDL schema:\r\n```\r\ndirective @testDirective(scope: String!, input: Int!, opt: Int) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT\r\n```\r\nand can be invoked on object or field level like this:\r\n```rust\r\n    struct Query;\r\n    ...\r\n    #[Object(\r\n        directive = testDirective::apply(\"object type\".to_string(), 3, None),\r\n    )]\r\n    impl Query {\r\n        #[graphql(\r\n        directive = testDirective::apply(\"object field\".to_string(), 4, None),\r\n        ]\r\n        async fn value(&self) -> &'static str {\r\n            \"abc\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nwhich will result in the following SDL fragment:\r\n```\r\ntype Query @testDirective(scope: \"object type\", input: 3) {\r\n\tvalue: String! @testDirective(scope: \"object field\", input: 4) @noArgsDirective\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis allows to a nice way to extend grapqhl schema with additional metadata information.\r\nAnother powerful feature which is defined by apollo federation v2.1 is @composeDirective, which essentially says that any directives which need to be preserved on supergraph composition need to be declared with @composeDirective.\r\nIn order to achieve that two additional things need to be done on TypeDirective level and on SDL export options:\r\n```rust\r\n// enable composeDirective support\r\nSDLExportOptions::new().federation().compose_directive();\r\n```\r\nand on TypeDirective additional property is requred:\r\n```rust\r\n    #[TypeDirective(\r\n        location = \"fielddefinition\",\r\n        location = \"object\",\r\n        composable = \"https://custom.spec.dev/extension/v1.0\"\r\n    )]\r\n    fn testDirective(scope: String, input: u32, opt: Option<u64>) {}\r\n```\r\ncomposable property needs to contain strict URL with at least two path segments (last is always semver style version like v1.0) or apollo federation supergraph checks will fail.\r\nThe addtions above will result in additional schema fragment, which basically exposes directive as composable and is preserved in supergraph construction:\r\n```\r\nextend schema @link(\r\n\turl: \"https://custom.spec.dev/extension/v1.0\"\r\n\timport: [\"@testDirective\"]\r\n)\r\n\t@composeDirective(name: \"@testDirective\")\r\n```\r\nDifferent type directives can contain different compose extension urls - they will be grouped accordingly.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nCurrently this PR supporst only OBJECT and FIELD_DEFINITION locations, to keep the scope a bit smaller, but support for other grapqhl constructs can be added easily in the future.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- which name is better TypeDirective or SchemaDirective for macro?\r\n- it is possible to call function directly instead of directive::apply(...) style but since we generate a struct under the hood which we register as directive in that case we need a separate name for struct itself i.e:\r\n```rust\r\n#[TypeDirective]\r\nfn something(...)\r\n```\r\nand invocation can be \r\n```rust\r\ndirective=something(...)\r\n```\r\nBut the struct can be named as `somethingDirective` and registered as `schema.type_directive(somethingDirective)`. For me this might feel a little bit more natural, but generates two objects instead of one (currently apply function is a method inside struct).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/1308/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/1308/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/1305", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/1305/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/1305/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/1305/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/1305", "id": 1760385062, "node_id": "PR_kwDODo0plc5TLX3F", "number": 1305, "title": "Make type_name pub", "user": {"login": "banool", "id": 7816187, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTYxODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7816187?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool", "html_url": "https://github.com/banool", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/banool/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-06-16T10:54:59Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-16T20:32:13Z", "closed_at": "2023-06-16T20:32:12Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/pulls/1305", "html_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/1305", "diff_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/1305.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/1305.patch", "merged_at": "2023-06-16T20:32:12Z"}, "body": "I am building some somewhat complex code where I build a schema by recursing through an existing tree of types.

that reference themselves as nullable fields.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if I have this kind of type system:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput type Parent {\r\n    child: Child\r\n}\r\n\r\ninput type Child {\r\n    parent: Parent\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the checks would hit a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nMy attempt at a fix is to move the recursive part of the checks inside of the if statement which is handling nullable or list types. This also means reversing the order of the if statements.\r\n\r\nThis should mean that neither schema below will hit a stack overflow, and the first should pass where the second fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype TopLevel {\r\n    mid: MidLevel!\r\n}\r\ntype MidLevel {\r\n    bottom: BottomLevel\r\n    list_bottom: [BottomLevel!]!\r\n}\r\ntype BottomLevel {\r\n    top: TopLevel!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype TopLevel {\r\n    mid: MidLevel!\r\n}\r\ntype MidLevel {\r\n    bottom: BottomLevel!\r\n}\r\ntype BottomLevel {\r\n    top: TopLevel!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs part of doing this, I included a `typeref_nonnullable_name` function. The logic of this is suspiciously absent from the `type_ref.rs` implementation and I wonder if I should move this code to that location?\r\n\r\nI also added some tests.

generator.\r\n\r\n**What has changed?**\r\n- The source generator now uses a templating solution (handlebars), which makes the generator more robust. We can directly pass the `GraphiQLSource` struct to generate the source, instead of doing a lot of 'manual' string based manipulations. This introduces a dependency, but I think it is worth it from a long-term maintenance perspective.\r\n- Changed `credentials` field to an enum. I think that is better than allowing arbitrary strings. **[breaking change]**\r\n- The `endpoint` and `subscription_endpoint` are now relative urls instead of absolute ones. This matches with how routes are defined in most web frameworks; `Route::new().at(\"/\", ...)` in poem for example. This way, we do not have to know the exact origin url when developing the application, increasing the 'seperation of concerns'. **[breaking change]**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also created a PR to update the

have any mechanism to attach custom schema directives, there's no need to support renaming directives (since we know we won't have any name conflicts), nor any reason to support importing schema directives beyond the apollo ones (since they wouldn't be usable anyway).\r\n\r\nIn a future where custom schema directives are supported, this implementation will need to be replaced (presumably using the mechanisms that will support custom schema directives to configure the attached ink directives, plus some mechanism for handling renaming of \"known\" directives).\r\n\r\nTodo for the current approach\r\n- [x] write tests to verify the new printing\r\n- [x] apply apollo's testing harness to verify that this approach is in fact sufficient\r\n- [x] decide: should enable_apollo_link
