This also includes rewriting the inner literal extractor. The new extractor can now pluck literals out of more complex regexes such as `\\s+(Sherlock|[A-Z]atso[a-z]|Moriarty)\\s+`. The current version of ripgrep doesn't do any literal optimizations for that regex in particular.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this PR actually marks the end of ripgrep depending on `regex` directly for its primary search work load. It now depends on `regex-automata` directly, which exposes a more expressive API. For example, it lets one build regexes directly from `Hir`, which is quite useful in ripgrep's case because of the transformations it does on `Hir`. Previously, we had to roundtrip `Hir` back to the concrete syntax in order to turn it into a `regex::Regex`, since the `regex` crate very intentionally has no public dependency on `regex-syntax`. But `regex-automata`, as a more internal library that can evolve more rapidly, does have a public dependency on `regex-syntax`.", "reactions": {"url":

Because of our bad abstraction boundaries, we added a kludge to\r\ndeal with PCRE2 look-around by extending the bytes we search by a fixed\r\namount to hopefully permit any look-around to operate. But because of\r\nthat kludge, we wind up over extending ourselves in some cases and\r\ndragging along those extra bytes.\r\n\r\nWe had fixed this for simple searching by simply rejecting any matches\r\npast the end point. But we didn't do the same for replacements. So this\r\ncommit extends our kludge to replacements.\r\n\r\nThanks to @sonohgong for diagnosing the problem and proposing a fix. I\r\nmostly went with their solution, but adding the new replacement routine\r\nas an internal helper rather than a new APIn in the 'grep-matcher'\r\ncrate.\r\n\r\nFixes #2095, Fixes #2208",
