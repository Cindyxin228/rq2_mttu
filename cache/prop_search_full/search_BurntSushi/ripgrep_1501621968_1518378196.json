The commit messages have most of the details (including some goodies like a 2x decrease in release build time), but the TL;DR is that ripgrep now recognizes a `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. When set and non-empty, ripgrep will read shell arguments from it (one per line) and prepend them to whatever explicit CLI arguments have been given. A new flag, `--no-config`, prevents any sort of configuration from being loaded from a file.\r\n\r\nThis does not add any support for auto-loading config files from pre-determined locations like one's `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory.

However, the `gitignore` documentation seems to state very clearly that it should *not* behave this way:\r\n\r\n>Otherwise [if the pattern contains a slash], Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a / in the pathname. **For example, \"Documentation/*.html\" matches \"Documentation/git.html\" but not \"Documentation/ppc/ppc.html\" or \"tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html\".**\r\n\r\nThe real-world behaviour of git 2.16.1 is consistent with this.\r\n\r\nLooking at the `ignore` unit tests, the test patterns borrowed from [behnam/gitignore-test](https://github.com/behnam/gitignore-test) seem to have made this assumption as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# NO_MATCH\r\ndir_deep_02/*\r\n\r\n# NO_MATCH\r\ndir_deep_03/**\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth patterns say `NO_MATCH`, but the unit tests designed for them *do* in fact expect a match. I don't see any comments anywhere that explain why it should be different, so i'm guessing it wasn't an intentional design decision or anything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, *without* this change, if you check out the `gitignore-test` repo, build the file tree, and then compare `rg --files` to `git add . && git status`, you'll see that `rg` is missing the two matches for those directories. *With* the change, they both match exactly the same files.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/762/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

Don't feel strongly about it though.\r\n\r\nAlso, in hind sight maybe it's not worth mentioning that it's equivalent to adding a `^` pattern, since it's just an implementation detail that isn't really useful to anyone.

Please review and let me know if things can be improved upon.\r\n\r\nA few thoughts I had as I worked on this:\r\n\r\n- Rust's `format!` macro currently has no way of providing a custom padding character as a parameter. You have to provide it directly in the format string itself. (As per [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#syntax), only the width can be provided as a parameter.)\r\n- This meant that adding support for format strings as suggested in the issue discussion proved to be difficult. Right now, the argument only accepts a number. It seems that we'll have to write a custom code for left padding or rely on a library to achieve this. I'm open to suggestions on this one.\r\n- Should we handle possible combinations of CLI args? In the long help message for `line-number-width`, I've mentioned that it has no effect if `--no-line-number` is enabled, which is very obvious. Should I handle any other cases specific to this newly introduced argument to ensure nothing breaks?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!", "reactions": {"url":

Some of the lines exceed 80 cols, for example. And then some of the types are broken into multiple lines even though there are only like three entries. Is there any formatting work i can do on this for you? Would it be easier to read if each pattern was on its own line? Or is that too much vertical space?\r\n\r\n* Should i add an `ini` (e.g., `php.ini`)?\r\n\r\n* Given that `zsh` has zsh profile/`rc` files, should i also add `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, &c., for `sh`?\r\n\r\n* On the subject of shell types, it's kind of weird: `fish` gets its own type, which makes sense to me, since it's out doing its own thing. But `zsh` having its own type when it's a more-or-less Bourne/ksh-descended shell just like bash is a little strange, especially when you consider that bizarro incompatible shells like tcsh are included with bash.\r\n\r\n* Should i add `*.psql` (PostgreSQL) for `sql`?\r\n\r\n* Should i add a `systemd`? systemd has loads of different extensions: `*.conf`, `*.service`, `*.target`, &c.\r\n\r\n* Should i add a `license` or similar for `LICEN[CS]E`, `COPYING`, &c.?\r\n\r\n* I'm thinking `*.xsl` belongs with `xml`?\r\n\r\n* Might consider `*.xml.dist` for `xml` too \u2014 this is common in the PHP world.\r\n\r\n* If we're considering lock files (`Cargo.lock`) i suppose we should probably also add the ones for Composer, Yarn, &c.?\r\n\r\nLet me know if i'm getting all over-engineer-y
