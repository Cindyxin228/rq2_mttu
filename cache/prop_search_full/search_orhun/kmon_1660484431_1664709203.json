Utilize `clap_mangen` and `clap_complete`.\r\n\r\n- `target/man`: contains the manpage\r\n- `target/completions`: contains the shell completions\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nUpdating the manpage with each command-line change is a maintenance burden. After switching to clap4, it makes sense to let it generate the manpage.\r\nWhile we're at it, we can also generate shell completions.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n`cargo build`\r\n\r\n## Screenshots / Output (if appropriate):\r\n\\-\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
