This made it impossible to render pixel-perfect in some cases, which would be required in things like pixelart games or maybe other cases like UI rendering.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the changes as minimal as possible, but only with these changes I was able to render pixel-perfect textures, where one pixel in the texture exactly matches a pixel in the final canvas:\r\n\r\n- Allow the size given in the CSS styles to be fractional, as this is intended behavior. For example, if the canvas is 200 native pixels wide (so the HTML attribute says width=\"200\"), with a device pixel ratio of 1.5 the CSS width should be:\r\n  `(200/1.5)px = 133.333333px`\r\n- Made sure width & height passed to the viewport in the FrameInput is the actual size in native pixels. Previously, the original native pixels (returned by `canvas.width()` and `canvas.height()`) were first converted to account for the device pixel ratio and then rounded, as this is expected for the window_width and window_height attributes in the FrameInput. However, then these values were extrapolated again to get the viewport width + height, which resulted in rounding errors to make the viewport not match the actual size in native pixels.\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\nIf you have a fractional device pixel ratio such as 1.5 (you can fake it by using the browser zoom), then you can watch the width/height attributes of the `<canvas>` as well as the width/height CSS styles of the `<canvas>`, as well as log the `viewport` and `window_width` & `window_height` attributes of `FrameInput` during rendering. You will notice, in the previous versions there will be a mismatch of these metrics that are off by some pixels in some cases where rounding errors happened.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the native pixels (width/height HTML attributes of the canvas and also the width/height attributes of the FrameInput's viewport) will __always match__, and the CSS styles of width/height will __always__ be `(native pixels / device pixel ratio)px`, even if it's fractional (which is desired).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asny/three-d/issues/166/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":

I discovered that egui was still rendering with the wrong viewport dimension size when using a non-integer display scaling factor. So I thought I'd prepare a contribution to try to fix it.\r\n\r\nPrior to this fix, it was casting pixels_per_point to a usize, so non-integer scaling factors (for instance, 1.5) resulted in rendering\r\nthe gui with the wrong viewport dimensions. This bug could be reproduced by running the lighting example with a display scale of 150%.\r\n\r\nThe main fix here is to ensure the cast happens after applying the scaling factor, and to make sure the scaling factor multiplication happens in f32.\r\n\r\nA more subtle change is that we explicitly round the result to the nearest integer. This is to reduce the potential error in cases where the multiplication does not produce a whole number.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asny/three-d/issues/100/reactions",

This is due to the tight event/render loop (becoming a busy loop) when there is nothing to render.\r\n\r\nI added another FrameOutput argument, `wait_next_event`, to wait until an event occurs before calling the next render_loop. By default its value is false to maintain old behavior (=opt-in). This is especially useful for programs that do not depend on time (no animations) and only need to redraw on user interaction such as model viewers, GUIs, etc...\r\n\r\nIt allows saving battery time on devices like phone/tablet or laptops and reduce heat/fan noise unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented for desktop and web platforms (although there was no CPU usage problem on web (chrome), but it's nice to save battery/heat).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asny/three-d/issues/88/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0,
