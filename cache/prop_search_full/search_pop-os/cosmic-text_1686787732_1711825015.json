The editor seems to be always marked as changed unless manually set to unchanged.\r\n\r\nI fixed this issue by adding a save point to the editor which sets the current change to the last saved state.

I believe this is ok, due to the fact that:\r\n  1. Nothing sets a language on the shaping buffer,\r\n  2. I would expect there to only be one direction per script value (not to mention the fact that the max multiplication factor is 2), and\r\n  3. I would expect there to usually be only one script value per font (e.g.: Latin/Hebrew/Chinese).\r\n* Exposing the `ShapePlanCache` via `FontFallbackIter` is nasty, but there isn't a great alternative given the fact that `ShapePlanCache` is held by `FontSystem` and `FontFallbackIter` holds a `&mut FontSystem` and we need a `&mut ShapePlanCache` in `shape_fallback`.  That said, this nastiness is narrowly scoped and entirely internal to this crate.\r\n\r\nAll tests in `cosmic-text` still pass with this change.\r\n\r\nFor some anecdotal evidence on performance

"2023-08-28T17:01:12Z"}, "body": "Try to ensure that using \"the width computed during an unconstrained layout\" as the width constraint during a relayout produces the same layout. Note, here I aim to also make this work for cases where the initial width limit isn't completely unconstrained. This is useful for certain UI layout algorithms.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/134\r\n\r\n* Instead of computing the LayoutLine width from the positioned and aligned glyphs, we pass through width computed during line wrapping (unless justified alignment is used, in this case we use the old approach because the use case for measuring the width isn't really applicable to justified text since that will just expand to the provided width). For the produced width to later give the same wrapping results when passed in as the `line_width` it needs to use the same exact float arithmetic that was used to compute the width that is compared against `line_width` when making line wrapping choices. Passing this width through as the LayoutLine width is the most convenient option without making more major changes to the API. Nevertheless, I am imagining that if we get a dedicated measurement method (i.e. that doesn't do the final positioning and alignment of glyphs and which caches `Vec<VisualLine>`), then this width can just be exposed there instead of preserving it in LayoutLine.\r\n**edit:** one thing that I was going to mention here is that this means the width in LayoutLine might not as precisely match the positioned glyphs where their positions have been perturbed by different floating point errors. \r\n* Incidentally, this fixes https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/169. **Note:** If that behavior was intentional, then a different approach is needed to expose the width to the user.\r\n* Switch subtraction from `fit_x` to checking whether potential addition to the current line width would exceed the `line_width`. This avoids the float error being dependent on the provided `line_width` value.\r\n* When eliminating trailing space from the line width, we avoid backtracking with subtraction (which would not give the same exact value due to float error) and instead save the previous width and use that.\r\n* If the previous word did not exceed the line_width, we now include a single blank word even if it would cross the width limit since its width won't be counted. This is necessary to get the same wrapping behavior when re-using the measured width (which doesn't count a single trailing blank word). Note, this whitespace logic may be reworked anyway if <https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/155> is addressed.\r\n* Change tests to use `opt-level=1` to keep test runtime down.\r\n* Add `fonts` folder for fonts used in tests.\r\n* Fix an issue where a non-breaking whitespace was assumed to be the start of a section of spaces which included characters that weren't even whitespace.\r\n* Add some TODOs about incongruencies between `is_whitespace`, justification, and line breaks.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/175/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/175/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/174", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/174/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/174/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/174/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/pull/174", "id": 1863588946, "node_id": "PR_kwDOIQGngs5YnJ1X", "number": 174, "title": "enable fontconfig feature by default", "user": {"login": "urlordjames", "id": 32751441, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzUxNDQx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32751441?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames", "html_url": "https://github.com/urlordjames", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/urlordjames/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-08-23T15:43:52Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-09T07:30:09Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-23T20:10:23Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/pulls/174", "html_url": "https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/pull/174", "diff_url": "https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/pull/174.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/pull/174.patch", "merged_at": "2023-08-23T20:10:23Z"}, "body": "Resolves #167.

applied and potential avenues for reusing layout work done for width measurement when performing the final layout) and noticed a few things that could be easily de-duplicated or adjusted to improve clarity (IMO).\r\n\r\n* Some variables declared at the top of `ShapeLine::layout` weren't used until the second phase which is much farther down, so I moved them down to be at the start of that phase.\r\n* Replaced the `push_line` `bool` with checking `layout_lines.is_empty()` which is effectively equivalent.\r\n* Some variables defined outside the loop over `visual_lines` were reset with each loop iteration, so I moved their definitions down into the loop.\r\n* Added a separate `justification_expansion` instead of reusing the `alignment_correction` variable (which just shifts the line in all other modes, but was used to hold how much each space should be expanded when justifying). This is more clear to the reader and avoids several later checks of whether the alignment is `Align::Justified` in spots where `alignment_correction` is used. _(I may have gone overboard with the other changes but I think at least this one is pretty useful)_\r\n* I was able to factor out the common code during iterating visual line ranges for LTR/RTL text into a `process_range` closure as well as combine several cases of iterating over glyphs during this.\r\n* Removed unnecessary `mem::swap(&mut glyphs, &mut glyphs_swap); ` (`glyphs` is not used later and can just be directly moved out of)\r\n\r\nNone of these changes should affect the behavior (If I didn't make any mistakes!).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/170/reactions",
