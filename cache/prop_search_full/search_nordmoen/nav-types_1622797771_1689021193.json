On a recent dependabot run, I noticed that nalgebra <0.27.1 has a critical vulnerability. This PR updates the versions of serde and nalgebra to the latest, and changes the RealField trait to RealFieldCopy to mimic simba v0.5.1 behavior to make the crate build. I did look into updating quickcheck and rand, but it turned out to break the tests in a way where it wasn't clear whether the code or the test had the issue.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nordmoen/nav-types/issues/12/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nordmoen/nav-types/issues/12/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
