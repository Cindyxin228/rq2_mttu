We use this in the Prometheus exporter to apply generational semantics to metric updates, which powers recency and idle timeout behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen we wrote the code, we inadvertently created metric handles which wrapped the inner atomic itself, instead of wrapping the `Generational<T>` wrapper.  Without proxying updates through `Generational`, we never update the generation.  This leads to idle timeout logic being broken.  Woops.\r\n\r\nThe actual change to fix it is simple: clone the `Generational<T>`, not the `T`.  We've also added a test that asserts that recent metrics live past the idle timeout based off their initial creation time.\r\n\r\nFixes #263.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Toby Lawrence

where histograms did not appear to be removed after they exceeded the configured idle timeout.\r\n\r\nThere were two bugs, one in the version the user reproduced the issue with and one in the current version of the code:\r\n- used wrong method to check for/delete idle histograms (current version)\r\n- did not remove aggregated distributions for histograms that were reported as inactive (both versions)\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the issue centered around the fact that the exporter aggregated histograms (distributions) internally every time something wants to render the metrics.  This provided bounded memory usage over time for a given metric, as well as tracking aggregated histograms/summaries in the way that Prometheus expects.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though we would correctly delete a histogram from the registry when we detected that it had been idle too long, we did not delete the internally aggregated version that the exporter also held... and since rendering works off of the internally aggregated data, it essentially ended up as the histogram continuing to be rendered/reported.\r\n\r\nFixes #228.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Toby Lawrence <toby@nuclearfurnace.com>",

Metadata only, essentially.\r\n\r\nNow that those macros exist, the concept of using them to register a metric no longer exists, and so having an optional description doesn't make much sense.  As such, the macros now require a description to be passed, and we've tweaked the methods on `Recorder` to reflect this.  Units are still optional.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we no longer support passing a full metric key (name + labels) as, again, these macros no longer need to support registering a specific metric in the

Specifically, it provided a mechanism to get a \"handle\" to a metric: instead of blindly using the macros, you could hold a tangible object that gave you access to increment counters or set gauges, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis provided a meaningful performance boost when you could deal with the limitations of that -- can't have dynamic labels -- but was ultimately a little too coupled for my taste, and I wasn't yet a good enough developer to find a suitably decoupled design to continue providing it.\r\n\r\n### Present day\r\nThis PR explores a design that moves back towards what `metrics-runtime` provided -- metric handles -- while fitting into the current ecosystem in such a way that the handles can be decoupled and backed by an arbitrary implementation.\r\n\r\nThis shows up in a few ways:\r\n- `Recorder` now only hands back handles, it does not deal with updating a metric at all\r\n- there are three new types (`Counter`, `Gauge`, and `Histogram`) with concrete sets of methods specific to the metric\r\n- each of those types can be backed by an arbitrary value that implements a trait that fulfills the interface of the metric i.e. the `GaugeFn` trait requires a way to increment, decrement, or set the absolute value of the metric\r\n- we have new macros for defining a metric -- description/unit -- called `describe_*!` while `register_*` now create metric handles for a given metrics\r\n\r\nCrucially, the macros for updating a metric have not changed, so this change is backwards-compatible for many use cases where metrics were never being \"registered\".  For use cases where metrics were \"registered\" ahead of time, they'll now have to change to \"describing\" those metrics instead.\r\n\r\nFor static metrics -- no dynamic labels -- this represents a significant performance boost opportunity when the handles can be stored or held.  In cases where the macros are still used normally i.e. `counter!(...)`, there will be a slight performance decrease as we're creating a new handle just to perform the operation, as well looking up the metric in the registry.  There's a pathway to store the handle in a local static so that we can reduce the overhead to simply an atomic load, when compared to holding the handle and updating it directly.\r\n\r\nFor dynamic metrics, the performance should be on par.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\nIn some cases, using handles will provide a reduction/regression in behavior.  Take the `metrics-tracing-context` layer, for example: it grabs the fields of the current `tracing` span, if there is one, and augments the labels of the metric being emitted using those fields.\r\n\r\nWhen using metric handles, those fields would only be grabbed when the handle is created.  In cases where the tracing fields represented something dynamic, like the user ID for a given web request, or something else of that nature, the ability to implicitly capture that would be lost if the metric handle was held as a field on a struct that was created before the point where the metric was expected to be updated.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, stateless layers -- make all metrics start with a specific prefix, or don't emit metrics whose name matches a list of patterns, etc -- will experience no difference in behavior.", "reactions": {"url":

As we rebuild `Key`s on every metric emission, and shuffle around vectors of strings and so on, we generally perform a lot of extra work in the critical path of emitting metrics that readily shows up in profiling.\r\n\r\nAs a practical example, the usage of `metrics`, `tracing`, and `metrics-tracing-context` within a popular open-source observability project, [Vector](https://vector.dev), represents nearly 40-50% of all computation on certain workloads.  This is an untenable position for any project that is performance-conscious and goes against one of the core goals of `metrics` to be a zero-cost abstraction.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we've significantly altered how the integration layer accomplishes its job.  In no specific order:\r\n- span fields are now denormalized amongst spans to avoid traversing span stacks every time we want to access them\r\n- the underlying field storage is now pooled so it can be re-used over time\r\n- we've reworked the way we enter the `tracing` codepath to avoid needlessly generating objects which involve expensive computation in their `Drop` implementations\r\n\r\nAs I work on Vector officially, we'll demonstrate the performance benefits of this PR using it as an example: with these changes, we see a roughly 17% improvement in performance on a representative workload that emits roughly 250K metrics/second, purely from reducing the overhead of emitting those metrics.", "reactions": {"url":

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[ 0.10.0 ] - 2021-06-27</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>mock!</code> will now allow both methods and trait impls to be gated with\n<code>#[cfg()]]</code> attributes.  The attributes will be forwarded to all generated\ncode.  This allows for example only mocking certain traits on certain OSes.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/asomers/mockall/pull/297\">#297</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>automock will now automatically generate Debug implementations for traits and\nstructs.  mock! will to, if you put <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> above the struct's\nname.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/asomers/mockall/pull/289\">#289</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for specific impls.  A specific impl is an implementation of a\ntrait on a generic struct with specified generic parameters.  For example,\n<code>impl Foo for Bar&lt;i32&gt;</code> as opposed to <code>impl&lt;T&gt; Foo for Bar&lt;T&gt;</code>.  Mockall does\nnot yet support generic methods in such traits.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/asomers/mockall/pull/274\">#274</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mockall is pickier now about how you mock a trait on a generic struct.\nPreviously you could usually omit the generics.  Now, they're required.\ni.e.,\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>mock!{\n    MyStruct&lt;T: Bounds&gt; {...}\n    impl Foo for MyStruct {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\nshould now be written as\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>mock!{\n    MyStruct&lt;T: Bounds&gt; {...}\n    impl&lt;T: Bounds&gt; Foo for MyStruct&lt;T&gt; {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/asomers/mockall/pull/274\">#274</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed setting simultaneous expectations with different generic types on\ngeneric methods whose generic parameters appear in neither the arguments nor\nthe return type.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/asomers/mockall/pull/272\">#272</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.9.1] - 2021-02-13</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
