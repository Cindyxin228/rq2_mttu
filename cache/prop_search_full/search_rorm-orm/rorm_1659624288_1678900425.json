Windows and MacOS without caching (\"build from scratch\")\r\n- Fixed clippy SARIF results to use the correct relative paths (prefix `rorm/`)\r\n- Added scripts to convert the result file of `dscanner` to the SARIF file format for Code QL\r\n- Fixed caching issues on Windows (it's still slow, it's Windows)\r\n- Added MariaDB 10.7 to the pipeline (it has End Of Life in Feb 2023)\r\n- Dropped the clippy check from the Windows pipeline (for speed-up and to remove duplication)\r\n\r\nNote that CI on Windows and Linux currently still fails due to incompatible changes in the integration tests and (probably) a regression in SQL building for Postgres.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rorm-orm/rorm/issues/26/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
