Boxing the Large Terms like Reference, ExternalFun, InternalFun to decrease the size of the enum from ~152bit to ~64bit\r\n2. Changing the Map to actually use a HashMap, simplifying it's use.\r\n3. Adding ByteList to handle STRING_EXT\r\n     -> This can cause issues when a system happens to send a list of numbers which could but are not neccesarily under u8 as this would cause matches which expect a ByteList to fail.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it up to you if you are interested in these changes. \r\n\r\nBest Regards!
