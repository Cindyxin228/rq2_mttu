To work\r\naround that, the `toJson` function was used so that Scylla returns the\r\nparameters encoded as a JSON string. The serde_json library was added to\r\ndependencies solely for the purpose of parsing the encoded json map.\r\n\r\nSupport for direct deserialization of map types has been merged some\r\ntime ago, so there is no need to involve JSON as an intermediate step.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the logic responsible for parsing the `replication`\r\nmap from JSON representation and now the map is parsed directly from its\r\nCQL representation.

multiple paged queries to fetch results, and then merge all those results into one.  \r\n`page_size` must be set on the query that is passed to those methods.\r\n\r\nCurrently we use a single unpaged query to fetch data, but this might cause stalls (#298).\r\nIt's better to use many smaller queries and merge results locally.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nConnection::query_all(\r\n        &self,\r\n

The decision is based on the fact that `LocalSerial` is the one that provides acceptable performance. Users interested in strong, cross-dc consistency - which could also cause prohibitive latencies - should override to `Serial`.\r\n\r\nThe series also comes with a doc entry which briefly explains LWT queries (they weren't mentioned at all so far), as well as an extra validation layer which would prevent users from setting a wrong consistency level, without introducing any backward incompatible changes.\r\n\r\nThis series introduces a breaking change - serial consistency is now defined as a separate enum. Fixing the existing aplications is trivial and consists of replacing all occurrences of `Consistency::LocalSerial` to `SerialConsistency::LocalSerial` and `Consistency::Serial` to `SerialConsistency::Serial`.\r\n\r\nFixes #277\r\n\r\n## Pre-review checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Make sure you took care of the issues on the list.\r\n    Put 'x' into those boxes which apply.\r\n

When the control connection breaks, it attempts to\r\nre-establish by trying nodes from the `known_peers` list in random\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe `known_peers` list is modified only in two situations:\r\n\r\n- It is initialized from the known nodes list from the session's\r\n  configuration,\r\n- When topology refresh is requested, current control connection breaks\r\n  and is successfully reconnected, the `known_peers` list is\r\n  reinitialized from fetched topology info.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not enough. If only known node is provided in the\r\nsession configuration and the node is removed from the cluster, the\r\nTopologyReader won't be able to reconnect the control connection because\r\nthe only node from the `known_peers` list has just been removed.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is to update the `known_peers` list on each\r\ntopology refresh. This way, the `known_peers` list will be up-to-date\r\nand the TopologyReader will consider all nodes in the cluster when\r\nre-establishing the control connection.\r\n\r\nFixes #269\r\n\r\n## Pre-review checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Make sure you took care of the issues on the list.\r\n    Put 'x' into those boxes which apply.\r\n    You can also create the PR now and click on all relevant checkboxes.\r\n    See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have split my patch into logically separate commits.\r\n- [x] All commit messages clearly explain what they change and why.\r\n- [ ] ~I added relevant tests for new features and bug fixes.~\r\n- [x] All commits compile, pass static checks and pass test.\r\n- [x] PR description sums up the changes and reasons why they should be introduced.\r\n- [x] I added appropriate `Fixes:` annotations to PR description.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/270/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/270/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/264", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/264/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/264/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/264/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/264", "id": 940731394, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg2NzYwMjk5", "number": 264, "title": "docs: remove stray hashes from rust-driver.docs.scylladb.com", "user": {"login": "psarna", "id": 10433047, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDMzMDQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10433047?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna", "html_url": "https://github.com/psarna", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psarna/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2021-07-09T12:43:31Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-12T13:33:49Z", "closed_at": "2021-07-10T07:49:03Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pulls/264", "html_url": "https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/264", "diff_url": "https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/264.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/264.patch", "merged_at": "2021-07-10T07:49:03Z"}, "body": "Sphinx, the framework used for publishing docs on\r\nrust-driver.docs.scylladb.com, can't handle mdbook's comments\r\nstarting with '#', which results in broken docs pages.\r\nA simple heuristics for removing incorrectly generated snippets\r\nis added to the deploy script -

The connection keeper was not removed as it is still used for managing the control connection.\r\n\r\nThe new management scheme has following advantages over the previous approach:\r\n\r\n- The number of connections per node is now configurable.\r\n- Support for establishing per-shard connections over the non-shard-aware port (9042),\r\n- Automatic detection of the shard-aware port on a per-node basis - the driver uses it unless explicitly disabled in the configuration,\r\n- In case the shard-aware port is unreachable or hidden behind source-port translating NAT, the driver falls back to using the non-shard-aware port.\r\n\r\n__TODO__: I did some minimal testing (node restart, node add/remove) but should probably do some more (resharding, shard-aware port unreachable, shard-aware port is disabled/enabled after restart).
