Currently fetch flags and send metrics share the same poller but the next PR will need to change it to sync with other SDKs (15s interval for fetch flags, 60s interval for metrics).\r\n\r\nI updated the test checking all headers including the new `unleash-interval` header.\r\n\r\n### Important files\r\n<!-- PRs can contain a lot of changes, but not all changes are equally important. Where should a reviewer start looking to get an overview of the changes? Are any files particularly important?  -->\r\nThe most interesting change is not the header but the way we test our headers.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect is the \"seam\" where I decided to add interval. We can't have a static setting for the entire SDK because not all calls need the interval header (e.g. registration is not using it) and also we want to decouple interval for get flags and send metrics.\r\n\r\n## Discussion points\r\n<!-- Anything about the PR you'd like to discuss before it gets merged?

The headers are:\r\n- `unleash-appname`: the name of the application that is using the client. \r\n- `unleash-connection-id`: a unique identifier for the current instance of the client generated by the built-in UUID lib\r\n- `unleash-sdk`: sdk information in the format `unleash-client-rust:<version>`\r\n\r\nAll the headers are intended for the Unleash team so clients should not be affected.\r\nThe main use cases we have are:\r\n* capacity planning by knowing the number of unique connections made to the backend API\r\n* debugging misconfigured SDKs sending more traffic than expected\r\n\r\n### Important files\r\n<!-- PRs can contain a lot of changes, but not all changes are equally important. Where should a reviewer start looking to get an overview of the changes? Are any files particularly important?  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion points\r\n<!-- Anything about the PR you'd like to discuss before it gets merged? Got any questions or doubts? -->\r\nI added 2 new dependencies deliberately choosing versions that work on 1.60.0. However some transitive dependencies of existing dependencies have changed and require 1.63.0. I found that any dependency update will trigger this error. I updated MSRV check in Github Actions.\r\n\r\nAlso we have a new way of adding library version at compile time from the Cargo file.", "reactions": {"url":

The commit has been changed to one that has backported the changes related to variant hashing as described in the backgrund section.\r\n- Removed the override tests from the client spec tests we run. There is no logic to handle overrides in this SDKs, so those tests would always fail.\r\n- Update the way we test variant tests for the client spec (we previously only checked the enabled state, which is not sufficient).\r\n- Fix bugs in distribution algorithms for gradual rollout and variant selection (we were using `>` instead of `>=`).\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nAfter a customer reported that variant distribution seemed skewed we performed some testing and found that since we use the same hash string for both gradual rollout and variant allocation we'd reduced the set of groups we could get to whatever percentage our gradual rollout was set.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nTake a gradualRollout of 10%, this will select normalized hashes between 1 and 10, when we then again hash the same string that gave us between 1 and 10, but with modulo 1000 for variants, this will only give us 100 possible groups, instead of the expected 1000.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nForce the normalization to accept a seed, and make sure to use a new seed when normalizing the variant distribution hash.\r\n\r\n## Worth noting\r\nThis will require releasing a new minor version, since we are changing how hashing works on a pre-1.0 package.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/69/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0,

What are they and why are they being introduced? Feel free to also add screenshots or steps to view the changes if they're visual. -->\r\nI was trying out Unleashed for the first time (product is awesome!) but noticed features would never become enabled in the Rust client. I noticed if I only had features with descriptions things _did_ work, and tracked it down to the poller failing to parse the features from json. Not relevant to the Rust sdk but it does seem like if you create a new feature and don't give a description, the field is `null` in the json response, but if you create it with a description but then erase the description and save it, it returns `\"\"` instead of `null`.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the `description` field on a `feature` can be `null` - when it is `null` it fails to parse since it's represented by a `String` in the Rust representation.\r\n\r\nThe obvious way to fix this would be just changing `description: String` to `description: Option<String>`, but it does seem like it was intentional since there are other optional fields and it has a `#[serde(default)]` attribute. Maybe someone has some more context on that?\r\n\r\nThe default serde attribute isn't enough in this case because it doesn't apply when the field is present, but set to null, it only applies if the field isn't given at all.\r\n\r\nAssuming it was intentional to not make the description optional, this parser should turn an incoming `description: null` into `description: \"\"`.\r\n\r\nI added a test that fails before this change but passes afterward.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does it close an issue? Multiple? -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- (For internal contributors): Does it relate to an issue on public roadmap? -->\r\n<!--\r\nRelates to [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Unleash/projects/10) item: #\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Important files\r\n<!-- PRs can contain a lot of changes, but not all changes are equally important. Where should a reviewer start looking to get an overview of the changes? Are any files particularly important?  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion points\r\n<!-- Anything about the PR you'd like to discuss before it gets merged? Got any questions or doubts? -->\r\nIf it wasn't intentional to make the description _not_ optional we can go that route instead and just make it optional. I think there's some more work to do there since there is other code that assumes the field will be `String` and not `Option<String>`, but happy to do that work if that's the route we want to go.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/66/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,

It does not implement serialization and submission to Unleash. I'd like to handle that in a follow-up PR after we agree on the implementation of the counting.\n\n## Improvements from #57\n\nThis PR has a smaller impact than #57 in two significant ways:\n1. It does not introduce any new dependencies\n2. It does not negatively affect benchmarks (ran locally)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe disabled variant is counted on the feature level (`CachedFeature`), while each actual variant is counted on the individual variant (`CachedVariant`).\n\nThis PR introduces a new `CachedVariant` struct. That struct wraps all the data that exists in `api::Variant` and adds a new `count` property.\n\nAdditionally, I've introduced a `variants_metrics` method for the `CachedFeature` struct serializes its variant metrics into hash map.\n\n## Discussion points\n\n### Manual counting of variants\n\nI've left the task of counting variants as a manual job, keeping in line with how `yes` and `no` are counted. We could add an `increment_count` method to the `CachedVariant` struct, but I don't know if it's worth it.\n\n### Benches\n\nRunning the benches locally, I see no significant changes between the main branch and this. All differences appear to be within the noise threshold.\n\nThe one benchmark that is the most interesting is probably the \"batch/parallel unknown-features(str)\", which took a pretty significant hit in #57.\n\nRunning it with the latest changes in this branch (against main), actually resulted in _improved_ performance. This is probably noise, but it at least seems to indicate that this is fairly safe.\n```\nbatch/parallel unknown-features(str)\n                        time:   [3.6369 ms 3.6503 ms 3.6651 ms]\n

updated at: 2023-06-20T09:46:36+02:00)\r\n\r\nSimplify the CI build matrices as suggested in #56.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes our MSRV build from the standard build matrix and creates a new job called `msrv`. The `msrv` job builds the project using the `release` and `no-default-fetaures` flags.\r\n\r\nTo try and keep the builds more consistent, this PR also includes a `Cargo.lock.msrv` file. The file doesn't come into play for non-MSRV builds, but gets renamed before the MSRV build to pin the dependencies.\r\n\r\n## On building MSRV without tests\r\n\r\nWhile the build works with MSRV, the test fail. This appears to be due to a dev dependency on Tokio that requires a more recent version of `time` than we can use with the MSRV. As such (and because we already run tests on stable, beta, and nightly), I have removed the test stage from the MSRV jobs.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/58/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/58/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/55", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/55/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/55/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/issues/55/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/pull/55", "id": 1617305635, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD5zrGc5LrfnN", "number": 55, "title": "fix: variant weight can be up to `1000`", "user": {"login": "teqm", "id": 37597226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTk3MjI2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37597226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm", "html_url": "https://github.com/teqm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/teqm/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2023-03-09T13:53:12Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-23T11:22:22Z", "closed_at": "2023-06-23T11:18:28Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/pulls/55", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/pull/55", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/pull/55.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-rust-sdk/pull/55.patch", "merged_at": "2023-06-23T11:18:28Z"}, "body": "<!-- Thanks for creating a PR!
