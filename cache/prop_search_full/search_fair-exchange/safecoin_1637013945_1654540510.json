key values leading to unfair voting.  This is completely plausible because the function does, in fact use the authorized voter pub key as a string (*after* converting to bs58).  It is gobblety-gook code that is difficult to read (and apparently not a fair hash algorithm.)\r\n\r\n#### Summary of Changes\r\nreplace that sad code using standard solana_sdk::hash::Hash.  \r\n1. We use Hash.extend_and_hash to add the pub key to the vote hash.  \r\n2. This gets us a 256 bit hash\r\n3.  Convert that to a 128 bit value (so we can do math)\r\n4. take the value and modulo by 10 \r\n5. if that result is zero (should be 1/10th of the values) then return true.\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Fair-Exchange/Safecoin/issues/46/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Fair-Exchange/Safecoin/issues/46/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
