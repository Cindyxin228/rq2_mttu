start by saying that you have a very nice project here.\r\nI've been enjoying using it for couple of the last days, however the lack of support for multiple files in `KUBECONFIG` makes it pretty usable for me.\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with it a bit and decided to hack together a simple support for multiple files (addressing #49).\r\n\r\nWhat I'm doing here is that I'm processing all paths in `KUBECONFIG` into separate `config::Config` structs and then merging them into a single one that is then fed into the environment.\r\nThe source_file field is merged using OS specific path separators.\r\nWhile merging of the other fields is done by simple map extending.\r\n\r\nI've tested it with my workflow and it worked flawlessly, but I can image the change might break something I've not tested.\r\n \r\nLet me know what you think, I'm open to any suggestions.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/databricks/click/issues/63/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
