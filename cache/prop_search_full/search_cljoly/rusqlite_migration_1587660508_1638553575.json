There is a public re-export so nothing will break, it just makes the code easier to navigate.\r\n- Added `.down()` method on migrations\r\n- Added `.to_version()` method for migrating to an arbitrary version\r\n- Added logging to integration tests, this makes debugging much easier. One new dev dependency.\r\n- Improve logging somewhat\r\n- New error variants\r\n- Deprecated and hidden `MigrateToLowerNotSupported`. It's kept for back-compat, ideally should be removed.\r\n\r\nI split it to smaller commits, so you can cherry-pick if you like, but I think all the changes make sense\r\n\r\nSome things I noticed:\r\n- If `SchemaVersion::Inside` was not off-by-one, it would be more straightforward to use. `.to_version()` uses the natural version numbering: 0=nothing run yet, 1 = after first migration, etc.\r\n- Proposing to rename `.latest()` to `.to_latest()` or similar (just keep the two migrating methods consistent). \"latest\" doesn't evoke \"migrate to latest version\" in me at a first glance, more like something about getting the latest version number...", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cljoly/rusqlite_migration/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
