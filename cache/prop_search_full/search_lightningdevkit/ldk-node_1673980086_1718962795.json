is empty. This is fine/potentially needed for, e.g., Signet where Esplora's `fee-estimates` endpoint would return an empty dictionary.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to detect the empty map and fail our fee estimation if we encounter such a case, rather than using the 1 sat/vbyte fallback on mainnet, where differences in fee estimation could lead to costly force-closures.

#22.\r\n\r\nPreviously, transaction broadcasting and fee estimation was the concern of our BDK-based onchain wallet and its `EsploraBlockchain`. However, this for one meant these functions would also be subject to BDK's locking requirements, pontentially even requiring additional runtime threads. Given that the `Blockchain` trait is going away in BDK 1.0 anyways, the little convenience it gave us wasn't worth the additional complexity. Moreover, the prior design was not particularly modular, which made creating mock objects for tests hard, e.g., in #152.\r\n\r\nHere, we therefore move transaction broadcasting and fee estimation to two dedicated modules which take a cloned `EsploraClient` instance. This also allows us to make the calls in an async fashion while providing the blocking interface to LDK objects in a more reasonable manner that doesn't lean on tokio's `block_in_place`.\r\n\r\nWhile general rebroadcasting of transactions will be initiated via the `OutputSweeper` to come in #152, we now also immediately retry rebroadcasts after a small delay if they fail due to connection (or HTTP) errors.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/ldk-node/issues/205/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":

Rust.\r\n* Currently it is tested against a local instance of VSS. But we will be testing this as part of our CI pipeline as discussed in sync, currently working on it.\r\n* Alternative to env-var was feature-gate, but I didn't see much reason to introduce new feature for this test and it could be confusing.
