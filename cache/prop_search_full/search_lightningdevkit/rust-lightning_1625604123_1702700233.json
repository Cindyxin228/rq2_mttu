To reduce diff, this was\r\npreviously done with channel IDs, converting the `OutPoint`s to\r\nchannel IDs before using the map.\r\n\r\nThis worked fine, but is somewhat brittle - because we allow\r\nredundant channel IDs across different peers, we had to avoid\r\ninsertion until we had a real channel ID, and thus also had to be\r\ncareful to avoid removal unless we were using a real channel ID,\r\nrather than a temporary one.\r\n\r\nThis brittleness actually crept in to handling of errors in funding\r\nacceptance, allowing a remote party to get us to remove an entry by\r\nsending a overlapping temporary channel ID with a separate real\r\nchannel ID.\r\n\r\nLuckily, this map is relatively infrequently used, only used in the\r\ncase we see a monitor update completion from a rather ancient\r\nmonitor which is unaware of the counterparty node.\r\n\r\nEven after this change, the channel -> peer tracking storage is\r\nstill somewhat brittle, as we rely on entries not being added until\r\nwe are confident no conflicting `OutPoint`s have been used across\r\nchannels, and similarly not removing unless that check has\r\ncompleted.", "reactions": {"url":

all nodes support onion messages, so it may not be possible for a `MessageRouter` to find a complete path to an `OnionMessage`'s destination. A direct connection to the first node in an `OnionMessagePath` is therefore required. This PR adds a `ConnectionNeeded` event to signal to users to connect to a node.\r\n\r\nWhen sending an `OnionMessage` or replying to one -- but not when forwarding -- `OnionMessenger` will buffer messages for immediate recipients that are not peers and upon connection make them available for processing as normal. A new `release_pending_connections` method is added to the `OnionMessageHandler` trait for the `PeerManager` to call and provide the necessary `ConnectionNeeded` events. Thus, `PeerManager` now implements `EventsProvider` and is called in `BackgroundProcessor` accordingly.\r\n\r\n`PeerManager` calls the new method in its own `timer_ticks_occurred` method. This allows `OnionMessenger` to drop any buffered messages for nodes that haven't been connected in a certain number of timer ticks.", "reactions": {"url":

I played around with a lower_bound `Writeable` method to optimize out some cases of having to run through the logic, but it doesn't really help in `ChannelManager` and `ChannelMonitor` or other deeply-nested structs because we're calling `write` there which hits our `LengthCalculatingWriter` instead of being able to use an optimized version. We could totally restructure the API to have `Writeable`s call a magic method on the `Writer` which can short-circuit the write, but that's a lot of indirection and I'm lazy.\r\n * `Avoid allocating when checking gossip message signatures` probably isn't a huge regression, cause hashers are buffered, in essence, anyway, but I didn't check.", "reactions": {"url":

"Currently, our holder commitment broadcast only goes through the `OnchainTxHandler` for anchor outputs channels because we can actually bump the commitment transaction fees with it. For non-anchor outputs channels, we would just broadcast once directly via the `ChannelForceClosed` monitor update, without going through the `OnchainTxHandler`.\r\n\r\nAs we add support for async signing, we need to be tolerable to signing failures. A signing failure of our holder commitment will currently panic, but once the panic is removed, we must be able to retry signing once the signer is available. We can easily achieve this via the existing `OnchainTxHandler::rebroadcast_pending_claims`, but this requires that we first queue our holder commitment as a claim. This commit ensures we do so everywhere we need to broadcast a holder commitment transaction, regardless of the channel type.\r\n\r\nThis addresses the prerequisites to

"Previously, our `ChannelState` contained bits for both states and flags. To make matters worse, some of the flags could apply to multiple states. This led to its API being very cumbersome, having to apply masks in most scenarios to check for certain states. As LDK grows and more features are added requiring more states/flags, the need for a simpler API arises.\r\n\r\nThis refactor aims to improve this by decoupling the state flags from the `ChannelState` enum. Each state that requires flags will now have its own flags type, to ensure flags can only be applied to their intended state. All of this is done while maintaining backwards and forwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhile conceptualizing this design, I also explored two other options:\r\n\r\n1. Using boolean flags to denote the different flags on a specific state: this did not mesh well with our serialization concerns, and having to check a set of booleans in specific scenarios doesn't really scale.\r\n2. No enforcement of flags only being applied to their intended state: this results in a smaller diff with less boilerplate code, but I think the cost here is worth it to ensure correctness, especially as LDK matures and more features are added.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2691/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

reasonable middleground between the Rust ecosystem's \"bump constantly, MSRV is stable\" and keep supporting really old rustc versions that increase maintenance overhead. \r\n\r\nNotably, this change reduces complexity of our CI scripts and will allow Mac users to run the CI scripts on MSRV locally on Apple Silicone chips.\r\n\r\n(cc @notmandatory)", "reactions": {"url":

I added a new `PeeledPayment` struct instead of using the existing (very similar) `Hop` struct, to simplify the returned value and avoid leaking the `fuzzy_internal_msgs` types.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only

"When `MonitorUpdateCompletionAction`s were added, we didn't\r\nconsider the case of a duplicate claim during normal HTLC\r\nprocessing (as the handling only had an `if let` rather than a\r\n`match`,

This can lead to a\r\nchannel freezing indefinitely if an HTLC is claimed (without a\r\n`commitment_signed`), the peer disconnects, and then the HTLC is\r\nclaimed again, leading to a never-completing\r\n`MonitorUpdateCompletionAction`.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple - if we get back an\r\n`UpdateFulfillCommitFetch::DuplicateClaim` when claiming from the\r\ninbound edge, immediately

"Because scoring is an incredibly performance-sensitive operation,\r\ndoing liquidity information decay (and especially fetching the\r\ncurrent time!) during scoring isn't really a great idea. Instead, this PR moves to handling decaying in a background processor job.\r\n\r\nThis should fix #2311, which apparently is still an issue for some users as of 0.0.116.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion of an alternative approach where we fetch the time at the start of a routefinding session, store it on the stack, and pass it through to the scorer as we go. I opted not to do this because (a) bindings can't map unbounded generics, which this would need, (b) this avoids actually doing the decay during scoring at all, which probably saves an ms or two, though certainly not a ton, (c) this leads to a much nicer/simpler API - we can remove `Time`, which we either need to remove or make public (see #2497), and can drop the excess type alias, both of which are much nicer than the alternative. I'm open to more discussion here, but the cost of having one more thing to call as time moves forward doesn't seem high enough to outweigh a, b, and c here.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2656/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2656/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2655", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2655/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2655/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2655/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2655", "id": 1933493231, "node_id": "PR_kwDOB0Kp2s5cSFT4", "number": 2655, "title": "Replace `lightning-block-sync` test that depended on `foo.com`", "user": {"login": "TheBlueMatt", "id": 649246, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTI0Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/649246?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt", "html_url": "https://github.com/TheBlueMatt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/milestones/36", "html_url": "https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/milestone/36", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/milestones/36/labels", "id": 9852877, "node_id": "MI_kwDOB0Kp2s4AllfN", "number": 36, "title": "0.0.118", "description": null, "creator": {"login": "TheBlueMatt", "id": 649246, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTI0Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/649246?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt", "html_url": "https://github.com/TheBlueMatt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheBlueMatt/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 18, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2023-08-29T05:37:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-24T18:22:07Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2023-10-24T18:22:07Z"}, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-10-09T17:18:58Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-14T02:10:31Z", "closed_at": "2023-10-14T02:10:31Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pulls/2655", "html_url": "https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2655", "diff_url": "https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2655.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2655.patch", "merged_at": "2023-10-14T02:10:31Z"}, "body": "Our tests should generally not rely on internet access, and should not rely on the behavior of any given remote server.
