accident), fixes #592, partial #560 (At least the steps found), partial #517. With #517 I feel that the issue with clickto specifically is (mostly) fixed, there are still times that we can freeze with the motion/resize and spam clicking and such. However if think these issues can be reproduced in other focusbehaviours with enough effort. In future we will want to optimise the events we read will in these modes to prevent them being \"held up\" by events less important to the user (e.g. visual responsiveness events), similar to what dwm does in their move/resize functions. This will be in the future though (especially as I currently don't have an idea of how to integrate it nicely into our structure).\r\nMany Thanks!", "reactions": {"url":

I will add some other small bugs fixes in here, if you have any let me know.\r\n\r\nThis now has an automatic way of getting refresh rate with xrandr. And the limit is moved to event_translate to optimise a bit, as instead of mostly processing an event then ignoring it we ignored as soon as it comes in.\r\n\r\nFixes #497, fixes #574. I have also removed an issue where a fullscreen window's drop down menus would be buggy, by removing the move to top for fullscreen windows. This also allows child dialogs and such to appear above the fullscreen window easier (without also being buggy). This however has the issue of windows which have override redirect set to true (we completely ignore these windows) may appear over the fullscreen window, e.g. the polybar window tray often has override redirect set to true. I prefer these windows appearing above compared to the apps being buggy and slow to response (To 100% clarify the bugginess is due to the constant move to top).\r\n\r\nThe issues with unmanaged window appearing above fullscreen windows is now fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/571/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh":

Instead of using the point we just use the window the cursor is reporting. Also changed it so the notify mode doesn't have to be normal (so it can be grab and ungrab), this eliminates half the reason window focus events get missed.\r\n\r\nTo add the reason I have found where focus events are missed are when a mouse button is pushed we don't receive any motion or enter notifies. So when you move the mouse to a window when holding a button the focus didnt change (this is without the validate focus), as the notify mode is classed as a grab. So allowing these events means the focus would update once the button is released (However this is probably unneeded with the updated validate focus)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nps I gonna add some comments tomorrow, have cant let hertg show me up :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/566/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 2, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/566/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/565", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/565/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/565/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/565/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/pull/565", "id": 1046512389, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCqmyT84uLnyu", "number": 565, "title": "relative_find helper: fix bug, add tests, add docs, remove duplicate code", "user": {"login": "hertg", "id": 3533648, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzM2NDg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3533648?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg", "html_url": "https://github.com/hertg", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hertg/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/milestones/1", "html_url": "https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/milestone/1", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/milestones/1/labels", "id": 7244597, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCqmyT84Abos1", "number": 1, "title": "0.2.10", "description": "", "creator": {"login": "VuiMuich", "id": 4779365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzkzNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4779365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich", "html_url": "https://github.com/VuiMuich", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VuiMuich/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 40, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2021-10-12T14:36:21Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-11T17:30:36Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2021-12-11T17:30:36Z"}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-11-06T13:43:46Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-08T13:01:15Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-08T13:01:14Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/pulls/565", "html_url": "https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/pull/565", "diff_url": "https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/pull/565.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/pull/565.patch", "merged_at": "2021-11-08T13:01:14Z"}, "body": "I saw that the `relative_find` logic was implemented redundantly in `focus_tag_change`.

\"soft\" reloading.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it properly. The current reloading system is to hard reload because soft reloading does not work properly for now. In This PR I will try to enumerate the issues and fix them.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] Use owned type in `Config` trait: this change will allow the state to get owned type and not depend on a configuration to be loaded. My idea is that if the configuration changes but the state still use an old configuration, we should load only the state parameters for consistency.\r\n- [x] Move `Config` from `State` to `Manager`: I wasn't sure why the config field was in the state but then I realized it is because it was part of the state. So to solve the previous point, I'm moving the `Config` to the `Manager`. `Manager` now has a `reload_config()` that takes no argument and spread the new configuration across the different states of the application\r\n- [x] Reload config in XWrap should work now: I noticed a few lines of code were missing for it to work. I have not tested this yet but my hope is to fix it.\r\n- [x] `screen_create_handler` is back to `Manager`: it made sense to move it to the State when config was there but now that I changed it it needs to go back to the Manager to be able to access the config. I did not touch the other functions that were moved to the state as I believe they were good :+1: \r\n- [x] Because `State` does not have the `Config` field, it now loses its generic... which is nice\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n- [ ] ~~I believe there is a startup script for theme that should be re-started when doing the reload_config somehow... maybe keeping track of widget processes... it does not sound trivial~~\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/539/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3,

\r\n\r\nSo this is finally the goal: separating core logic from binary logic. The core logic will allow other tiling manager to be based on leftwm. It will also allow people to make their own specific tiling manager (this is my personal intention).\r\n\r\nWith this change you can see that the optional dependencies of \"cli\" are now not optional anymore and moved to the crate `leftwm`. On the other hand, `leftwm-core` will see its dependencies reduce: all cli's feature dependencies but also anyhow, toml, liquid, shellexpand. The more reduced, the better (for projects who use leftwm but will make different choices). This will improve in future PR but I want to keep this one strictly about the splitting.\r\n\r\nThe \"common\" module has now become the `leftwm`'s lib. This allows easy access and resolve a few \"dead_code\" warnings.\r\n\r\n### The downside\r\n\r\nThe split means that you will need to maintain and publish 2 crates on crates.io. You can use [`cargo-release`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release) to help you on that. I personally usually do the command `cargo release --workspace --no-dev-version minor` (or major or patch). I suggest to keep the version of the 2 crates synchronized as it is easier to maintain but you can have different version if you want.

https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/pull/472#issuecomment-932315027 I accidentally broke the parsing behavior of Margins.\r\n\r\nExisting behavior before my change:\r\n - no values: gives a warning, assume 10px on all side\r\n - 1 value: assume that value on all side (match CSS)\r\n - 2 values: assume the first value for top and right and the second value for bottom and left\r\n   :warning: This is contradicting CSS where 2 values means: first value for top and bottom and second value for right and left\r\n - 3 values: assume the first value for top, second value for right, third value for bottom and left\r\n   :warning: This is contradicting CSS where 3 values means: first value for top, second value for right and left, third value for bottom\r\n - 4 values: top, right, bottom, left (match CSS)\r\n - more than 4 values: gives a warning, assume 4 values\r\n\r\nWhat I implemented:\r\n- no values: assume 0 on all side, no warning \u274c\r\n- 1 value: assume that value on all side (match CSS) :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- 2 to 3 values: assign value to top, right, bottom and left, use 0 if one is missing \u274c \r\n- 4 values: top, right, bottom, left (match CSS) :heavy_check_mark:

This is just an initial commit, and to open a bit of a discussion. I agree with the notes in #447, where there should be an option to allow the user to choose to have per tag or per workspace layouts with which could be toggled via a command. Other issues we should address is the management of layouts, with this added complexity it becomes harder for a new dev to find their way through the code, e.g. the fact that the layout vec is stored in config, manager, workspace, and now tag. I feel it would be helpful to add a layout manager similar to the [focus manager](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/pull/356), which holds the list, which mode the user is in, and common functions around changing the layout. \r\n\r\nAnother option we could add would be choosing the mode per workspace, say tags sent to workspace one will be forced to the same layout but on workspace two will use the tags preferred layout.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks!\r\n\r\nEdit closes #260,  closes #447.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/448/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1":
