Thank you for open-sourcing this lib!\r\n\r\nI searched around for something I could use for making a graphql call and your lib was the one that provided the most straight-forward thing without needing too many deps and some assumptions of context.\r\n\r\nI added ability to support a POST body and use other services besides `s3` (in my case, I needed `execute-api`) & thought I'd send it along to you, if you'd like a contribution to your project. This PR should address Issue https://github.com/psnszsn/aws-sign-v4/issues/1 in this repo.\r\n\r\nYou can see the `CHANGELOG.md` in this PR for an overview description of changes. Copy-and-pasted here for your convenience:\r\n\r\n> ### Added \r\n>\r\n> - Support for sigv4 `service` attributes beyond \"s3\" (e.g. \"execute-api\") in `AwsSign` struct\r\n> - Support for \"body\" attribute beyond \"s3\" in `AwsSign` struct\r\n> - More documentation\r\n> \r\n> ### Changed\r\n> \r\n> - Upgrage Rust Edition to 2021\r\n> - Upgrade dependencies\r\n> - License from MIT to BSD 2-Clause (like MIT, but \"don't blame me if things go wrong\")\r\n> \r\n\r\nNo worries, if you're not accepting PRs. Just let me know & I'll just rename the project in my fork instead (will continue to attribute you in any case, of course). If you are open to contributions, I was thinking of a v0.3.0 to update the interface to make some args optional (e.g. \"body\"), perhaps add a builder interface, and/or some light typing, and tweaks like that.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I know this project hasn't been active in 3 years, but I still appreciate your work! Thank you for saving me a bit of effort!\r\n\r\nKen", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psnszsn/aws-sign-v4/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psnszsn/aws-sign-v4/issues/4/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
