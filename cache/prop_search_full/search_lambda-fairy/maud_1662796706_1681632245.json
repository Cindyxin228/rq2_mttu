No hard feelings if you close this outright. :-)\r\n\r\nI found for my use case that I needed to write `display(...)` in a lot of places, especially in cases where I was using external types (especially the many datetime formatting types from `icu`).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds [autoref-based specialization](http://lukaskalbertodt.github.io/2019/12/05/generalized-autoref-based-specialization.html) to the `html!` macro such that it will choose a type's `Render` implementation if it is available, and use `Display` as a fallback.\r\n\r\nThe blanket impl of `Render for T where T: Display` was removed in #271 for good reasons, and I will try to justify this PR in terms of those reasons:\r\n\r\n- #266 (Impl Render for borrows): This PR does not add any new blanket impls of `Render` or `Display`.\r\n- Performance: Due to specialization, integers can still be rendered using `itoa`.\r\n- Semantics: Arguably, `Display` is intended to provide a human-readable string. While this isn't necessarily tied to the HTML representation of the thing, it is not unreasonable to want to use the output of `Display` in HTML. This solution treats the output of `Display` as unescaped content (so it will be escaped before appending, by going through `maud::display(...)`). If a situation arises where the `Display` and `Render` implementations should be completely different, specialization allows this on a per-type basis.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this PR is that compiler errors are slightly more confusing when a type implements neither `Render` nor `Display`. I have tried to name the magic inner types used in the macro with that in mind.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. :-)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/issues/359/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/issues/359/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/issues/358", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/issues/358/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/issues/358/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/issues/358/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/lambda-fairy/maud/pull/358", "id": 1427634025, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAa0xYc5BxQpq", "number": 358, "title": "Bump itoa to v1", "user": {"login": "paolobarbolini", "id": 6215781, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTU3ODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6215781?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini", "html_url": "https://github.com/paolobarbolini", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paolobarbolini/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-10-28T18:22:24Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-29T13:58:06Z", "closed_at": "2022-10-29T13:57:55Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lambda-fairy/maud/pulls/358", "html_url": "https://github.com/lambda-fairy/maud/pull/358", "diff_url": "https://github.com/lambda-fairy/maud/pull/358.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/lambda-fairy/maud/pull/358.patch", "merged_at": "2022-10-29T13:57:55Z"}, "body": "itoa 0.4 used `mem::uninitialized`, which is a very bad API as it's way of doing uninitialized memory goes against Rust's memory model.
