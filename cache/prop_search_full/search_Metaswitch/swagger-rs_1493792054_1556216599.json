As such we create a new type, `ContextualPayload`, which implements `hyper::body::Payload`, and allows the addition of some contextual data.\r\n\r\n   - `hyper::headers` has been removed. The replacement https://docs.rs/headers/0.2.1/headers/ doesn't provide a common interface, so in the interest of reducing change, we use a migration crate - https://crates.io/crates/hyper_old_types\r\n\r\n    - `Into<HeaderValue>` is not implemented for useful things like Strings, Vecs of Strings and DateTime, so we add some utility functions in `swagger::header`.  We also add move common code for X Span ID here as well.\r\n\r\n  - `hyper::client::Service` has been removed. We re-implement it in `swagger::client`, so we can implement Swagger middleware.\r\n\r\nWe upgrade `hyper-tls` to 0.2 (from 0.1). As per https://github.com/Metaswitch/swagger-rs/issues/51#issuecomment-486120194, we can't currently upgrade further (either `hyper-tls`, or `native-tls`, or `openssl`), due to native-tls limitations.\r\n\r\nWe remove any dependency on `tokio-core`, which is deprecated, as the codegen moves to using `tokio` directly as part of the `hyper` 0.12 work.\r\n\r\nWe take this opportuntity to move a bunch of static code in the codegen for multipart support into the crate. This is hidden behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\nWe remove the deprecated `AddContext` type.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Metaswitch/swagger-rs/issues/63/reactions", "total_count":

Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a [line-wrap](https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap) crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n>   - `Base64Display` creation no longer uses a `Result` because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\n>   configs that `unwrap()` for you are no longer needed\n> - Add a streaming encoder `Write` impl to transparently base64 as you write.\n> - Remove the remaining `unsafe` code.\n> - Remove whitespace stripping to simplify `no_std` support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: `filter(|b| !b\" \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c\".contains(b)`.\n> - Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.\n> \n> # 0.9.3\n> \n> - Update safemem\n> \n> # 0.9.2\n> \n> - Derive `Clone` for `DecodeError`.\n> \n> # 0.9.1\n> \n> - Add support for `crypt(3)`'s base64 variant.\n> \n> # 0.9.0\n> \n> - `decode_config_slice` function for no-allocation decoding, analogous to `encode_config_slice`\n> - Decode performance optimization\n> \n> # 0.8.0\n> \n> - `encode_config_slice` function for no-allocation encoding\n> \n> # 0.7.0\n> \n> - `STANDARD_NO_PAD` config\n> - `Base64Display` heap-free wrapper for use in format strings, etc\n> \n> # 0.6.0\n> \n> - Decode performance improvements\n> - Use `unsafe` in fewer places\n> - Added fuzzers\n> \n> # 0.5.2\n> \n> - Avoid usize overflow when calculating length\n> - Better line wrapping performance\n> \n> # 0.5.1\n> \n> - Temporarily disable line wrapping\n></tr></table> ...

"Benjamin,\r\n\r\nThis is a straight forward, backwards compatible, addition to ContextWrapper to allow it to be cloned.\r\n\r\nAs ContextWrapper simply contains a context, and a reference to the API, it should be possible to clone it if the Context itself is clone-able.\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to write client APIs using code generated by Swagger because it means a client with a context can easily be cloned. A client without a context is already clone-able.\r\n\r\nIt'd be good if this could be merged into both 1.x and 2.x - but I don't currently see a 1.x stable branch?", "reactions": {"url":

multiple services to be served on the same port.\r\n\r\nBecause the `NewService`s being combined may have different types, and may have different associated `Instance` types, a `BoxedNewService` trait is used to uniformize the return type of the new_service() method. This trait is implemented on all `NewService` implementations.\r\n\r\nThe composites make minimal assumptions about the associated types of the `NewService`s being combined - the functionality these types need to have for the composites to be formed is abstracted into the `HasPath` and `HasNotFound` traits (for the `Request` and `Response` associated types respectively). Implementations of these traits are provided for the concrete types that swagger-codegen uses for these associated types.", "reactions": {"url":

very important for audit purposes; just knowing who it was done to is not enough. Also it is useful to be able to report per-issuer (i.e., per-third-party-app) statistics from server applications, and this is easier if that information is present within the application (rather than just in logs).\r\n\r\nWe agreed to drop `auth_type` and `expiry_deadline`. The first (`auth_type`) would encourage services to have auth-type-dependent behaviour, making the testing matrix more complex; the second (`expiry_deadline`) is not actually useful - authenticators may wish to do internal caching based on deadlines, but the validity period of the auth data doesn't imply anything about the validity period of the requester's authorization.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change (new field in struct), hence there is a version bump.

useful to gather metadata about an authentication for microservices to use, both for logging and for further authorization purposes. This PR brings the following new fields on the `Authorization` struct:\r\n\r\n* `auth_type` - the authentication mechanism that generated this authorization data. In cases where the authorization data is delegated to other microservices, this field contains the original authentication mechanism.\r\n* `issuer` - when a system is operating on behalf of a subject, the issuer field stores the identity of the system. Optional.\r\n* `expiry_deadline` - used when the authorization data is cached, used to start a session, or used to construct a token passed back to the client, and expiry information is needed. Optional.\r\n\r\nThis constitutes a breaking change of the API, so the version of the crate has been bumped to 0.4.0", "reactions": {"url":

"merged_at": "2017-08-09T10:56:06Z"}, "body": "Per much discussion we've had, we want to support properties in our API endpoints which may be set to the value `null`.  \r\nWe can indicate this in Swagger with the `x-nullable` property, for which there is precedent[[1]](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/229#issuecomment-222942851).\r\n\r\n**For existing users of the binary types, this is a breaking change**.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved through the introduction of a new type, `Nullable<T>`.  \r\nThe nullable type represents values that are present on the API request, but have the value `null`.  \r\nValues that are null are represented as `Null`, while values that are present are represented as `Present(value)`.\r\n\r\nThis is distinct from values that are not present in the request JSON.  \r\nIf a nullable value is not present in a request, the deserialization fails, as it would with any other non-optional value.\r\n\r\nNullable values may themselves be optional, through the `Option<Nullable<T>>` type.  \r\nAgain, the distinction is made between a value that is not present, and a value that is `null` - values that are not present are `Option::None`, null values are `Option::Some(Nullable::Null)`, and present values are `Option::Some(Nullable::Present(value))`.\r\n\r\nAll of this, of course, also applies to response values (i.e. both Deserialization and Serialization are supported).\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the `Nullable` type implements many of the methods present on the `Option` type, such as `map`, `unwrap`, and `and_then`.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this implementation, a modification has been made to the representation of binary string (i.e. base64-encoded) types.  \r\nPreviously, these were represented as `Vec<u8>`s, and had a special annotation added to the generated model to ensure they were (de)serialized by the correct method.  \r\nThis annotation clashed with the annotation required by optional nullable types, and so these have been moved to a Newtype, namely `ByteArray(Vec<u8>)`.  \r\nThis type implements the Deserialize and Serialize traits, meaning no annotation is required.  \r\nExisting users of the binary types who regenerate their code must then wrap their `Vec<u8>` instantiations in a constructor for the `ByteArray` type.  \r\nThe Deref trait has been implemented to allow automatic deref coercion to the underlying `Vec<u8>` type.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This merge has a related code changes in a merge request to the code generator, which includes the necessary Rust changes to correctly use these types, as well as documentation generation changes.*", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Metaswitch/swagger-rs/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,
