If we assume that an authsession is around 1024 bytes (this assumes a 16 char name + groups + claims) then this means that in 1Gb of ram we can store about 1 million in progress auth attempts. Obviously, we don't want infinite memory growth, but we can't use an LRU cache due to the future desire to use concurrent trees. So instead we prune the tree based on a timeout when we start and auth operation. Auth session id's are generated from a timestamp similar to how we'll generate replication csn's. We can then apply a diff that will split all items lower than the csn/sid and remove them from future consideration.\r\n\r\nWe set the default timeout to 5 minutes. This means that assuming 10,000 auths per second, we would require 3GB of ram to process these sessions before they are expired.
