To prevent this evicted items are sent to the haunted list, which retains the key and the eviction transaction id. This way any inclusion event that is older than the caches haunted item transaction id will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThese haunted sets however can become very large with a high number of keys and especially if the keys and values are nearly the same size.\r\n\r\nAs the value of the haunted items \"diminishes\" over time, and we already have the ability to deny includes older than a minimum transaction id (as part of cache clearing) we can re-use these mechanisms to trim the haunted set.\r\n\r\nThis way the haunted set may only contain entries that are within the look back limit, or the number of transaction in the past that we allow to be used.\r\n\r\nA lower look back limit means that the haunted sets are smaller, but cache accuracy may be lower as we can no longer use older transactions data. A higher look back limit means the haunted sets are larger but cache accuracy can improve as we can include a range of transactions inclusions and hit metrics.\r\n\r\nThe default value for this tries to balance this for highly parallel and concurrent workloads.

fixes numerous violations of `Miri`'s Stacked Borrow checker in `BptreeMap`. \r\n\r\nIn almost all cases, these violations appear to be inconsequential. Casting back-and-forth between `* const T` and `&T` appears to interfere with Miri's analysis even though such casts should not be able to introduce data races. Unfortunately, fixing the obvious violations of Stacked Borrows lead to the discovery of one instance of possible UB in `RangeMutIter`. This PR does *not* fix that behavior - it merely fixes enough violations to make that behavior discoverable via Miri. Further analysis is required to determine if `RangeMutIter` is actually sound. \r\n\r\nThis PR also does not fix any violations of Stacked Borrows in types other than `BptreeMap`. In the short term, I'm maintaining a [fork](https://github.com/preston-evans98/concread/tree/preston/no-ub) of the crate which exposes only the functionality that I've been able to show is free from UB. \r\n\r\n## Description of Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces no net new functionality. Instead, changes can be grouped into 3 buckets:\r\n1. Removing unneeded conversions between shared and mutable references which could trigger UB or cause spurious Stacked Borrows violations. \r\n    - The best examples of this are the `leaf_ref` and `branch_ref` macros, which returned `&mut T` but were nearly always coerced to `&T` immediately afterward. Since creating an aliased `&mut T` is UB *even if the alias is never dereferenced*, this behavior was very dangerous. And indeed, it dig trigger `Miri`'s anlysis in several cases. In this PR, I've added parallel versions of these macros which directly yield `&T`.\r\n\r\n2. Adding variants of existing functions that operate on raw pointers instead of shared references. These new functions allow us to avoid casts between `&T` and `*const T`. \r\n     - A good example of this kind of change is the `min_raw` function, which is exactly like `min` except that it takes a `*const Self` instead of `&self` and returns a `*const K` instead of `&K`. \r\n     \r\n3. Restructuring tests to avoid coercing from `*const T` to `&T` and back by simply storing the `*const T` in a separate variable rather than shadowing it.\r\n     - A good example of this kind of change is `test_bptree2_node_leaf_remove_order`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/concread/issues/125/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,
