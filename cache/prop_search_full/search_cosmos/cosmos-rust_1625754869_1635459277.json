An important consideration in this update is that the ibc module has been split off into it's own repo at https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of the ibc-go protos, @jkilpatr discovered that the service compilation (in the `compile_*_services()` functions) recompiles and overwrites the regular definitions (in the respective `compile_*_protos()` functions), resulting in missing definitions. This is a result of combining all .proto definitions into a single file, e.g. ibc-go/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v1 has genesis.proto, query.proto, transfer.proto, tx.proto. After running 2 stage compilation for the protos and then the services, the `GenesisState` struct from `ibc-go/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v1/genesis.proto` was missing in `ibc.applications.transfer.v1.rs`. Cancelling the service compilation (aka the 2nd stage) resulted in the `GenesisState` struct appearing but all grpc client methods from the other files were not being generated. Applying the service compilation method (using `tonic_build`) to **all** ibc-go proto files results in everything we want compiled.\r\n\r\nThis 1 stage compilation approach was applied to the updated cosmos-sdk protos and several missing definitions were discovered (see the latest commit for which ones precisely).\r\n\r\nNOTE: wasmd and cosmrs have not been touched and require updates \r\n\r\nNOTE: the last commit in this PR is a quick fix to resolve a namespace conflict introduced by prost's generation of an enum and a struct both named Validators in `cosmos-sdk-proto/src/prost/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.rs`'s `stake_authorization` mod. This is not a sustainable solution, but it does allow the module to compile. I renamed the enum to `IsStakeAuthorizationValidators` and the struct to `StakeAuthorizationValidators` to most closely match the generated go names

release introduces several minor breaking changes (see below), among other\nimprovements, that clean up a few RPC-related data structures and ensure better\ncorrectness of the <code>TrustThresholdFraction</code> data structure when constructing\nand deserializing it.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/925\">security issue</a>\nwas reported in <code>prost</code> v0.7, and we attempted to upgrade to v0.8, but we are\nstill awaiting one <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tokio-rs/prost/issues/502\">bug fix</a> in\nv0.8 before we can upgrade. The moment that is fixed in <code>prost</code>, we will upgrade\nto v0.8 and provide another <code>tendermint-rs</code> release.</p>\n<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[tendermint-rpc]</code> Remove the <code>TmEvent</code> and <code>Attribute</code> structs and replace\nthem with their equivalent domain types from the <code>tendermint</code> crate\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/918\">#918</a>)</li>\n<li><code>[tendermint]</code> The <code>TrustThresholdFraction</code> struct can now only be constructed\nby way of its <code>new</code> constructor. Deserialization also now makes use of this\nconstructor, facilitating better validation. The <code>numerator</code> and <code>denominator</code>\nfields can be accessed (read-only) via their respective methods, since the\nfields are now private.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/924\">#924</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>BUG FIXES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[tendermint]</code> Update Genesis for Tendermint v.0.34.x (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/pull/917\">#917</a>)</li>\n<li><code>[tendermint-rpc]</code> Fix bug where <code>NewBlock</code> events emitted by Tendermint could not be parsed because of a missing field (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/930\">#930</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IMPROVEMENTS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[tendermint-proto]</code> Regenerate the Rust equivalents of the Tendermint\nProtobuf structures for Tendermint v0.34.9\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/871\">#871</a>)</li>\n<li><code>[tendermint-rpc]</code> Add <code>PartialEq</code>, <code>Eq</code>, <code>PartialOrd</code>, <code>Ord</code> and <code>Hash</code> trait\nbounds to the RPC URL types\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/919\">#919</a>)</li>\n<li><code>[tendermint-rpc]</code> Propagate JSON-RPC errors through the Rust subscription (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/932\">#932</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.20.0</h2>\n<p><em>Jun 22, 2021</em></p>\n<p>This release's number is bumped up to v0.20.0 due to two minor breaking changes\nin our public APIs (see the breaking changes section below for details).</p>\n<p>Also, since nobody was really making use of the Light Node, we decided to remove</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
