The complaint is that the `ureq` error is very large, much larger than the other error variants in the `error_chain` error definition. I just boxed the error variant as is the usual solution. I guess just silencing the warning works as well but this is probably a bit more performant on the happy path.

as it did before (a few months ago). Not sure what the issue is exactly but since I always want it to start maximized anyway I figured the easiest fix is to simply add a configuration flag for this.\r\n\r\nThere's a little bit of a conflict between setting the window position and maximizing it. I decided to just always set the position (as before) and maximize if requested after that. This causes the window to first show up unmaximized for half a second which is admittedly a bit janky but while it instantly appears maximized if I leave out setting the position, it also flashes white for a split moment which is pretty uncomfortable and less desirable in my opinion. This also has the advantage of the window remembering its position when unmaximized.\r\n\r\n~~I also updated the dependencies of `gelatin` and fixed the resulting breakage caused by the `winit` upgrade. Let me know if you want me to split this part off into a separate PR.~~ *(Edit: I missed that there was already another PR working on this so I removed those changes)*\r\n\r\nI also noticed quite a few clippy lints triggering, most of which seemed quite sensible, and I also get a deprecation warning for `compare_and_swap` on the latest Rust 1.50.
