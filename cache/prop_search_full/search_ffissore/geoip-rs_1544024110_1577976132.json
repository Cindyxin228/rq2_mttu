This adds a new dependency, actix-rt which is the async runtime for actix-web, and also the cors support has been moved to a separate crate now.\r\n\r\nI've also added dotenv support so the variables can also be configured from a `.env` file, which can be easier to use in some instances.\r\n\r\nLastly, I've made some minor changes to avoid some unneeded to_owned and unwraps, it's on a separate commit so it's easier to review.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ffissore/geoip-rs/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ffissore/geoip-rs/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
