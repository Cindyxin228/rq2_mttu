project.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I fixed this Issue https://github.com/fschutt/printpdf/issues/137. I changed the if statement so that it doesn't use the is_normal() function. Instead I check the output of the classify() function so that also zero numbers will accepted.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I created a macro \"impl_ord!\" that offers the functionalities of the ord trait. I would like to add that because I am trying to implement a table method for this library and I need for that a max and a min function for the Mm type. \r\n\r\nThirdly. I implemented Eq for Mm and Pt. This was required for the impl_ord Macro\r\n\r\nI already tested it with unit tests and it works.\r\n\r\nI would  really appreciate if you would merge it to the master branch so that everyone could benefit from the changes.\r\n\r\nIf you have any tips or ideas for me how I can contribute and help, please let me know.\r\n\r\nJulien\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

PDF generation library I found that supports custom fonts, unicode and SVG out of the box, but I was only missing annotations because I need to put links on my PDFs.\r\n\r\n2 hours ago I had no idea how PDF works internally, but looking at your code and the output from other PDF libraries I made a scape hatch to lopdf in the Page struct, so that it can be extended with arbitrary PDF dictionaries.\r\n\r\nI added a specific example adding a link to some text because from all the different types of annotations, I think links may be the most useful.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's something that can be kept around until there's a proper implementation for all the missing features, at which point people should stop using this error-prone variant and instead use specific functions that do the type checking.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fschutt/printpdf/issues/141/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

using `allsorts` to do actual subsetting which would significantly reduce the PDF size. This is not actually removing glyphs but at least it is omitting completely unused fonts from the PDF output. \r\n\r\nI am using the `PdfLayerReference::set_font` function to mark fonts as used and then skip unmarked fonts in `FontList::into_with_document`. This is a rather simple *hack*, but it allows for adding all the fonts you want without wasting space on fonts / font variants that are not used at all. The main usecase for me is with the `genpdf` create where it is required to add all 4 variants of a font (regular, italic, bold, italic-bold) even if not all of them are used.\r\n\r\nLet me know if

OffsetDateTime polyfill for wasm in src/date.rs does not implement the copy trait. Therefore printpdf can't be build for wasm-unknown-unknown. I think the most simple fix is to change the function signatures for to_pdf_time_stamp_metadata and to_pdf_time_stamp_metadata to use a OffsetDateTime reference. A copy is not necessary anyway.

As far as I see, it does not change the existing public API.  Yet the new methods `add_external_font_data` and `with_font_data` are slightly different from the existing data becuase they accept a `Vec<u8>` instead of a `io::Read` implementation for the raw font data.  This is because the user must already have read the font data if they were able to parse it and construct a `FontData` instance from it.\n\nMy suggestions for the next steps:\n- Replace `rusttype` 0.8 with either `ab_glyph` or `owned_ttf_parser`.  `rusttype` 0.9 moved to the `ttf-parser` crate.  With `ttf-parser`, iterating over all Unicode characters is extremely slow, especially in debug mode, see https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-glyph/issues/18.  The solution is either to use `ttf-parser` directly (`owned_ttf_parser` in this cause because `Box` requires a static lifetime), or `ab_glyph`, see the linked discussion.  Also, in `rusttype` 0.9, it is no longer possible to access the unscaled metrics, so moving to `ab_glyph` or `owned_ttf_parser` mitigates the need to un-scale the scaled metrics.\n- Make that dependency optional so that users can opt out of the default font backend if they use something else.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fschutt/printpdf/issues/78/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fschutt/printpdf/issues/78/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
