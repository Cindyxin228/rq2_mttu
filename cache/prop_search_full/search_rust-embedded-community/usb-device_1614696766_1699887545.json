"Windows usb host do not wait for the whole descriptor to be send before moving to the set_address phase.\r\nInstead it enters the status stage by emitting a ZLP on EP0 Out (`Status Out`) instead of sending the expected `DATA IN` request.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced by using a `max_packet_size_0` smaller than the device descriptor (typically 18bytes).\r\n`UsbDeviceBuilder` uses a default value of 8 which triggers the issue.\r\n\r\nThe attached logic analyser trace demonstrates that : [small_ctrl_packet.zip](https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device/files/5826724/small_ctrl_packet.zip) (requires saleae logic 2)\r\n\r\n## Solution in other usb stacks\r\n\r\n### The linux Kernel\r\nThe linux kernel's usb gadget stack [accepts a transition to the status phase at anytime during an IN request](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/usb/gadget/udc/fsl_udc_core.c#L1496-L1501) by priming the OUT EP before starting to process the IN request.\r\n\r\n### Mbed-OS\r\n\r\nMbed-OS' usb stack stalls the endpoint 0 if it receives an Out packet while processing transfer in the `Receive` direction.\r\nSee:\r\n- `USBDevice::_control_out` [returns false](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/drivers/usb/source/USBDevice.cpp#L215) if it's processing a transfer in a `Receive` direction.\r\n- `USBDevice::ep0_out` [stalls](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/drivers/usb/source/USBDevice.cpp#L922-L926) the endpoint 0 if `_control_out` returns false.\r\n\r\n### TinyUsb\r\n\r\nTinyUsb [hacks](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/blob/master/src/device/usbd.c#L981) the length fields of the request if the descriptor does not fit the endpoint's buffer and if the address is not yet set (aka at the start of the enumeration).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAccept a ZLP on `EP0 OUT` during a `DataIn` transfer as the signal to enter the Status stage of the transfer.\r\n\r\n##
