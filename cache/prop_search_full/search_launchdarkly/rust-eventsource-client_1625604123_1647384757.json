you get back from the builder would then be a `Client<TimeoutConnector<....>>`. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure that I've done this idiomatically, so please let me know if there are better ways to accomplish my goal.\r\nAnother way to do this would be to hide only the `hyper::Client` behind a trait, and keep exposing a concrete Client struct.\r\n\r\nI've also upgraded hyper, tokio, futures, and pin-project
