With contexts, the key cannot be empty. \n- The \"secondary\" meta-attribute which affected percentage rollouts has been removed. If you set an attribute with that name in a context, it will be a custom attribute like any other.\n- For backwards-compatibility, it is possible to enable \"secondary\" evaluation logic within the evaluation engine by enabling the `secondary_key_bucketing` flag. This will only affect contexts that were created via deserialization, since it is not possible to set \"secondary\" via a builder method. \n\n### Removed:\n- `User`, `UserBuilder`, `UserAttributes`. See `Context`, `ContextBuilder` and `MultiContextBuilder` instead.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchdarkly/rust-server-sdk-evaluation/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchdarkly/rust-server-sdk-evaluation/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
