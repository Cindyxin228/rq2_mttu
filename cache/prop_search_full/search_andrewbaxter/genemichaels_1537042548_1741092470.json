\r\n\r\nThe original macro formatting determined if spaces should be added purely depending on the punctuation and some information carried over from the previous punctuation. This isn't sufficient to determine whether two pieces of punctuation need to be joined or separated.\r\n\r\nFor instance `*` `=` -- the previous method tried to make this `*=` but if the next symbol is `>` it should actually be `* =>`. The provided rust libraries (and macro processing) aren't powerful enough to determine this and the rust syntax is too ambiguous/complex.\r\n\r\nThe new processing relies on whitespace to determine if two subsequent punctuation tokens must be separated or joined.  I.e. if they were originally separated with space, they must not be separated with space.  When writing code, people will add spaces if to pieces of punctuation can't be joined, so this is a good alternate signal.\r\n\r\nI tried to apply then the same logic for common cases: `.` typically pulls (non-punctuation) things together, `` ` `` typically begins a label so no space afterwards, `#` similarly (for `quote!()` macros).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much this affects existing code, so I want to test it on a few codebases to try to reduce other unnecessary/undesired changes.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I think I was originally hung up on determinism and whitespace - a deterministic formatter will produce the same output regardless of the initial formatting.  Basically the parsed token stream doesn't directly encode all significant whitespace, and I assumed that data model was complete and no additional whitespace was significant. The presence of whitespace is significant when reformatting raw token streams. Only the type and amount of whitespace is insignificant.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI agree that when the request is merged I assign the copyright of the request to the repository owner.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/issues/101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/issues/101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/issues/99", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/issues/99/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/issues/99/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/issues/99/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/pull/99", "id": 2740400531, "node_id": "PR_kwDOIm9vRM6FQD2O", "number": 99, "title": "Fix #97: Remove test blocking CI", "user": {"login": "andrewbaxter", "id": 597549, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzU0OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/597549?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter", "html_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaxter", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaxter/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-12-15T08:21:50Z", "updated_at": "2024-12-15T08:27:01Z", "closed_at": "2024-12-15T08:27:01Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/pulls/99", "html_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/pull/99", "diff_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/pull/99.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaxter/genemichaels/pull/99.patch", "merged_at": "2024-12-15T08:27:01Z"}, "body": "This was a misuse of a test to help debug things, but I guess the test is running in various workflows.

So if there's plain text followed by inline code then plain text:\r\n```\r\nhello this is `some code`.\r\n```\r\nthe text can be split before `.` which is incorrect (in a round trip a new space would be added).\r\n\r\nThe new strategy basically keeps track of the last break point on a like while building the comment line, and if text is encountered that goes over the max line length without a break point inbetween, the previous break point can be used.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised how little this broke, still waiting for the other shoe to drop.", "reactions": {"url":
