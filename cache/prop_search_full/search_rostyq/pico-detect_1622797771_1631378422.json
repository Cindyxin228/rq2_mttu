This addresses most of the issues it raised.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, this refactors the MaybeUninit calls to construct an array of MaybeUninit<T> first before later overwriting the respective fields and finally transmuting the [MaybeUninit<T>; ..] to [T; ..].\r\n\r\nThanks for this library!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rostyq/pico-detect/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rostyq/pico-detect/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
