If middleware is required, the [`reqwest_middleware crate`](https://docs.rs/reqwest-middleware/latest/reqwest_middleware/) can be included with the optional feature `enable-reqwest-middleware`, which is internally passed to `reqwest_maybe_middleware`.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this internally, I created a new function [`get_requests`](https://github.com/leontoeides/google_maps/blob/ed46d3ce5cb014918010d3991b5be12ed27128b4/src/client/impls.rs#L566) to wrap a common pattern for using reqwest.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier to work with the produced responses in a [`polars`](https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/) DataFrame, I added the Copy trait to several objects that had a very small size, such as 2-tuples of ints and enums with no extra fields.\r\n\r\nI also ran rustfmt on all changed files, which caused several unintended consequences for formatting. However, it may be good practice to run rustfmt (perhaps with custom settings) after every commit in the future, to prevent this and enforce consistent formatting.", "reactions": {"url":
