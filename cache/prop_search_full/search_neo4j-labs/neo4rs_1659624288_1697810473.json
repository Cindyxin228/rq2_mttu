neo4rs does not appear to support lists/vectors in node properties and probably elsewhere due to missing `Into` and `TryFrom` implementations. This patch firstly adds support for `Vec<A>` given `A` is already convertible to/from `BoltType`. Secondly, an implementation of `Into<BoltType> for f64` is provided, as this seems to be already supported the other way around.\r\n\r\nThese changes together should allow using neo4rs to work with databases containing vector embeddings.
