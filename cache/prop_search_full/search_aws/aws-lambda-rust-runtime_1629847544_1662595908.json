if available:*\r\nThis PR is meant to continue the work started here: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/466\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\n**Original description**:\r\n _Allows using any http_body::Body implementation in the response for lambda_http._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor context, the outstanding issue on the original PR stems from this comment: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/466#issuecomment-1121351819\r\n\r\nI picked up this PR and worked on it to the point where I believe that I had a viable testing approach. Ultimately I am blocked from performing the testing that has been requested in the original PR.\r\n\r\nHere's why\r\n\r\nIn order to configure `contentHandling` we have to put the integration in the `aws`  (ie. not `aws-proxy`) configuration.\r\n\r\nThe request is treated as a `LambdaRequest::WebSocket` by the lambda_http crate, why this is and why the rust code panics when operated in this way, I don't know.\r\n\r\nOn an `aws-proxy` configuration, binary formats are dealt with by encoding the body of the response as base64 and setting `isBase64Encoded: true` (documentation: [Working with binary media types for REST APIs - Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-payload-encodings.html))\r\n\r\nI managed to configure an API Gateway + Lambdas to be tested with CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT and it doesn't appear to work. What does work is setting the integration as `aws-proxy` but then it operates completely differently.\r\n\r\nIf we test through API gateway we only have two type requests, one where the function returns a `Body::Binary` and one where it returns a `Body::Text` (maybe a 3rd one for `Body::Empty`).\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a simpler verification where we rely on the current unit tests (I'm adding impl IntoResponse for binaries + tests) and pasting the Lambda console results (below) that I got while debugging.\r\n\r\nHappy to dig in further if I'm wrong and misunderstanding something.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's the console output for both a lambda that returns text and one that returns bytes\r\n\r\n#### Bytes\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\r\n  \"headers\": {},\r\n  \"multiValueHeaders\": {},\r\n  \"body\": \"YmluYXJ5IGRhdGE=\",\r\n  \"isBase64Encoded\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Text\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\r\n  \"headers\": {},\r\n  \"multiValueHeaders\": {},\r\n  \"body\": \"text data\",\r\n  \"isBase64Encoded\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, because I was most of the way there I want to share the commit I removed from this PR where I setup an API gateway (non-proxy) and the makefile changes where I would have added the verifications.

url includes th API GW stage information, so it's not easy to know what's the raw http path coming into the event.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we expose the raw http path in a general way, so people that need to know the exact raw path have a common interface, regardless of where the event comes from.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a better solution to #450 than #451 because the AWS documentation explicitly says that the API GW URL includes the stage when requests come in, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html, so our behavior is going to be more expected by API GW users with our current implementation. However, I see the need to access the raw path when you write integrations with other services. With this change, people can access that raw path in a consistent manner regardless where the event comes from.\r\n\r\n/cc @bnusunny\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Calavera

if available:*\r\n\r\nFixes #261 \r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new creates into this project to be able to implement Lambda Extensions in Rust. The work is not completed, and I wanted to share it with you all now that I have functional examples to get people's feedback on the direction I'm taking.\r\n\r\nThe first crate is `lambda-runtime-client`. I've extracted this crate from the current runtime. The idea with this is to be able to reuse clients for different APIs. This brings some guarantees about client behaviors, like having a User-Agent header by default.\r\n\r\nThe second crate is `lambda-extension`. This crate implements the [Lambda Extensions API,](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html#runtimes-lifecycle-invoke) which is the main point of this PR. I've included two examples in this new crate so I can get feedback about the API exposed to developers that want to create extensions in Rust.\r\n\r\n[Basic Example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/376/files#diff-73785481e24e1f7e116854203cd21288b4f0d14ef8d958f0796f00518215583d)\r\n[Example that subscribes to specific events](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/376/files#diff-7109631d88180a061dcc1085576cbd38987753568c6d5657936873ec5d535935)\r\n\r\nThere are a few things missing to get this PR in a mergeable state, mostly documentation, but I'll appreciate your input sooner rather than later so I can make these changes better.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/376/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/376/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/371", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/371/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/371/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/371/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/371", "id": 1059452973, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs4u0Pur", "number": 371, "title": "fix: add support for null/invalid type for headers", "user": {"login": "nmoutschen", "id": 15308855, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzA4ODU1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15308855?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen", "html_url": "https://github.com/nmoutschen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmoutschen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3848878988, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCVfZHs7laTuM", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/labels/0.5", "name": "0.5", "color": "0052cc", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-11-21T18:35:58Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-19T08:21:17Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-28T10:00:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/371", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/371", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/371.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/371.patch", "merged_at": "2021-11-28T10:00:15Z"}, "body": "*Issue #, if available:* https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/367\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nThis adds support for invalid/null value for headers, defaulting to an empty HeaderMap if need be, increasing resilience if the Lambda function would get an invalid value for headers.\r\n\r\nI've also added additional checks in the request deserialization tests to ensure we deserialize from the right type of API, as making deserialization more permissive could potentially break this.\r\n\r\n\u2753  __Open question before merging this__: this change is overly permissive.
