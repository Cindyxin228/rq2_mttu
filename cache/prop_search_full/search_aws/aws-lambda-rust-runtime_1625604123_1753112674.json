The field is documented everywhere it is added.\r\n\r\nAdds one test for the new functionality, testing it in both a parent and child struct.\r\n\r\nI was assisted by Amazon Q with this PR, so it's possible that an `other` field was added in places it doesn't make sense, or missed in places where it should have been added for consistency.  Nonetheless, I did my best to sanity-check, ensure that formatting was consistent, etc.  I also resolved a few test failures resulting from having a struct with a catchall `serde(flatten)`-ed into another struct with a catchall.

implement `Default` on all of the structs in Kinesis Events. This PR is a follow up to https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/1008, and implements `Default` for all the KinesisEvent-related structs.\r\n  \r\n\u270d\ufe0f *Description of changes:*\r\nImplement `Default` on all `KinesisEvent`-related structs.\r\n\r\nI also changed the test that I merged in in the last PR. At first glance, this test feels unnecessary because it is not actually making any assertions. However, because `cargo lambda init` generates code that inherently relies on `Default` being implemented on these structs, I think a unit test that attempts to exercise that code path is worthwhile. Theoretically, the test can never fail at runtime, only compile time.\r\n\r\nThis test will protect against breaking `cargo lambda init`'s autogenerated code in the absence of E2E

"\u270d\ufe0f *Description of changes:*\r\nClosing out some minor to-dos. My [tokio PR adding a biased; mode to join/try_join](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7307) landed. This allows us to skip the bookkeeping of keeping track of which branch of a `join`/`try_join!` statement was polled last, and always just poll in order.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor optimization for our graceful shutdown handler, since we always want to just poll our graceful shutdown future first before our non-op extension. So we can save a bit of memory on the stack by skipping storing a usize. It also very marginally could impact latency (by micros if not nanos, it's insignificant probably).\r\n\r\nAlso applying a similar optimization to the internal extension example where we have it the extension wait until after the main handler completes so that it can flush telemetry.\r\n\r\nThis involved explicitly setting `tokio` to `1.46`. This won't impact our MSRV as our MSRV is set to 1.81 but tokio is 1.70.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo clippy --fix`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/1007/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/1007/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/1005", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/1005/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/1005/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/1005/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/1005", "id": 3189263597, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs6cvM2q", "number": 1005, "title": "fix(ci): cut run-integration-test.yml over to \"mlugg/setup-zig@v2\", clippy fixes", "user": {"login": "jlizen", "id": 44884346, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODg0MzQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44884346?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen", "html_url": "https://github.com/jlizen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-06-30T17:12:49Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-07T14:36:16Z", "closed_at": "2025-07-07T14:36:16Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/1005", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/1005", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/1005.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/1005.patch", "merged_at": "2025-07-07T14:36:16Z"}, "body": "\u270d\ufe0f *Description of changes:*\r\n\r\n#### Run-integ setup-zig action change\r\n\r\nWe had pinned back our `cargo-lambda` version due to CI failures.

We need this in order to model the case where we can't call the inner service at all because of a failure to process the lambda invocation into a lambda event, in which case the future is immediately ready, and then its output is fairly large since it is handing the caller a new http request to make to the runtime.\r\n\r\nI think boxing is probably the right choice here, to avoid the error handling path bloating the happy path's variant to be 10x the size it needs to be. Most users would presumably prefer their happy path to be a bit more efficient at the cost of an extra allocation on an unhappy path that should be infrequent and will anyway fail the overall invocation (and possibly kill their runtime).\r\n\r\nTechnically `MaybeDone` would be slightly more efficient by saving us an Option, but it so trivial that it's not worth the refactor.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo clippy --fix`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/994/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/994/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/992", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/992/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/992/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/992/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/992", "id": 3057577253, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs6V3t16", "number": 992, "title": "fix(lambda-runtime,lambda-integration-tests): make spawn_graceful_shutdown_handler() async, await the extension being registered before spawning background extension handler task", "user": {"login": "jlizen", "id": 44884346, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODg0MzQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44884346?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen", "html_url": "https://github.com/jlizen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jlizen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2025-05-12T16:56:47Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-16T16:09:07Z", "closed_at": "2025-05-16T16:07:18Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/992", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/992", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/992.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/992.patch", "merged_at": "2025-05-16T16:07:17Z"}, "body": "\ud83d\udcec *Issue #, if available:*\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n\u270d\ufe0f *Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nFix a race condition in `spawn_graceful_shutdown_handler()`.

This mostly is the right choice, but it does run the risk of occasionally blocking the tokio runtime - ref: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/2653\r\n\r\nFor high throughput, performance sensitive lambdas that have async concurrency in their handlers, they might instead prefer to use a non-blocking writer on a dedicated logging thread.\r\n\r\nYou can do that today by initializing a totally custom tracing subscriber, but the default one has convenient integrations with some native Lambda ENVs, that I'd like to keep using. \r\n\r\nIdeally we would have an API to return the configured `fmt::SubscriberBuilder` rather than implicitly initializing it in our helper. But, the tracing types are [very unpleasant to work with](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/575) due to the JSON vs full formatting choice. We would need to introduce a layer of dynamic dispatch, custom traits, or something else like that, if we wanted to bake in the handling for the `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_FORMAT` ENV. We could also have a default subscriber builder that adds the JSON format at the end, but that felt very heavyweight for a simple 'default subscriber' helper API.\r\n\r\nI felt that adding a custom writer is an important enough knob that a new `init_default_subscriber_with_writer()` API was warranted. It is much simpler code.\r\n\r\nI don't think the semantic version of risk of surfacing the [fmt::MakeWriter](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/fmt/trait.MakeWriter.html) trait bound is significant - first of all, we already re-export all the tracing types, so presumably we would treat a major version tracing-subscriber bump as our own major version bump. Second, the `MakeWriter` trait is very simple and seems unlikely to change; it just expects a function that returns something that implements `std::io::Writer`.\r\n\r\nNote that we also now explicitly initialize `init_default_subscriber()` using STDOUT writer. This is the current default behavior of tracing subscriber, but it could presumably change across a major version bump. Probably better to pin it and make it a conscious choice on our own end to change it, if we later desire.\r\n\r\n### Documentation decisions\r\nI didn't explicitly document this in the README, since I think it would add confusion as it is not the right choice for most users. I do reference the API in the new `Graceful shutdown` README section, which I think is a useful breadcrumb for the sort of user that might need it.\r\n\r\nThe function docs do give a pretty good overview of what scenarios it might be appropriate for.\r\n\r\n## Turnkey 'graceful shutdown hook'\r\nPreviously I had a more extended graceful shutdown example that added manual non-op extension registry, signal handling, etc. @bnusunny pointed out that this could be very cheaply abstracted away by the library, and he was right!\r\n\r\nI went with a route that was pretty opinionated and on-rails, to reduce cognitive load of the API. Specifically:\r\n- I implicitly register a dummy non-op extension that is subscribed to no events\r\n- I implicitly construct the signal handling loop for SIGTERM and SIGINT, wrapping the user-provided hook\r\n- I implicitly spawn a task to drive the signal handling + extension future, rather than returning to to the caller to interact with\r\n- I panic on unrecoverable errors rather than returning a fallible `JoinHandle` or since the caller generally will be thinking of this as a background task\r\n\r\nNote that the dummy extension is very low cost, since the extension.nextEvent API will keep a connection but then hang indefinitely if no events come. So it won't frequently wake the task that contains it and the signal handling future. Generally waking will be from the signal handling. The cost is essentially the memory to keep the connection open (and also in my testing, the extension future was exiting on run() when no events were registered, though I wouldn't count on that behavior).\r\n\r\nNothing is stopping the caller from manually constructing a more sophisticated set of signal handling, avoiding registering a dummy extension if they already have another one, etc. \r\n\r\nI did reference these choices in the function docs. I also shared the panic conditions as well as a realistic usage example. I also added a small section in the README to help with discoverability.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think that this is the API that is proper for 95%+ of callers, and anyway we can expand on it if we need to. I assume at that point it probably is worth baking into the `Runtime` type since anyway that is where we add more granularity of behavior.\r\n\r\n### Dependency changes\r\n\r\nI added a new feature flag for this, `graceful-shutdown`, since it adds new dependencies:\r\n- `tokio`'s `signal` feature\r\n- `lambda-extension`\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting is that this is the first time we actually need the `tokio` `rt` feature (`tokio::signal::signal()` requires it, as does `task::spawn()`). That matters more for #984 , but I made this feature a default feature to make it easier to rip that out without breaking people if we ever remove the vestigial dependency on `rt/rt-multi-threaded` without feature flags (across a semver boundary).\r\n\r\nI didn't add a `lib.rs` passage documenting this new feature flag, but I did mention it in a new README section. I also added some `docs.rs` metatags to give us the nice `feature` indicator for both this as well as the tracing module re-export.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI didn't see any great existing unit tests or integration tests that can be run locally, to extend to cover this case. My doctest validates that it will compile, but not that it runs, since it would hang indefinitely waiting for events. It would be cool to set up some sort of build-time integ testing that uses `cargo lambda`, but that wasn't scope I had time for.\r\n\r\nI did throw in the graceful shutdown helper in our integration test that presumably runs against github actions - that at least will capture a fatal regression in our logic implicitly spinning up the non-op extension, etc, that would prevent the function from starting properly. Open to cutting a new integration test to run in CI that more specifically probes this, if folks feel it is necessary. Itust will be a bit awkward, since we'll need to have it sleep for a while to let the function spin down. Also either we will need sort of callback from the function to call against our github CI runner from inside the shutdown hook (aka expose a server in Github CI), or else poll eg CloudWatch Metrics or CloudWatch Logs to validate that the graceful shutdown logic fired.\r\n\r\n**Manual e2e testing**\r\n\r\nI did test a complete example manually both:\r\n- locally (with my `cargo-lambda watch` signal handling fix in place - [ref](https://github.com/cargo-lambda/cargo-lambda/pull/853) \r\n- after deploying to an AWS account\r\n\r\nBoth showed the expected behavior:\r\n- function runs and responds properly to handlers\r\n- graceful shutdown shows up in logs on runtime shutdown:\r\n\r\nFull AWS logs are at the end of this section.\r\n\r\nI previously had my test code checked in as a complete `examples/` folder code. But, it felt kind of ridiculous when literally the doc comment was sufficient to demonstrate the behavior. I'm glad to add it back in if we think it is useful. Another option would be to use that example to show a more 'custom' signal handling use case that doesn't use our helper, but I was concerned that that would confuse readers.\r\n\r\nAWS

issue, When running `pip3 install .....` it shows this error about system vs user installation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrror: externally-managed-environment\r\n\r\n\u00d7 This environment is externally managed\r\n\u2570\u2500> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install\r\n    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to\r\n    install.\r\n    \r\n    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,\r\n    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.\r\n    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip.

We currently refer to retrieving a layer arn from `cargo lambda deploy`. This was probably copy-pasted from other examples where we actually are calling `cargo lambda deploy` with the `--extension` target.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we are deploying the function directly, and there is no standalone extension - it is all inside our primary binary.\r\n\r\nTweaking the language to remove a reference to a deployed layer ARN.\r\n\r\nIf we want to add a guide to invoking the remote function deployment, we could.

"\ud83d\udcec *Issue #, if available:*\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\u270d\ufe0f *Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nThis is something I noticed from reading the code, but not a behavior that I have directly observed.\r\n\r\nThe panic layer contains [the following code](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/blob/main/lambda-runtime/src/layers/panic.rs#L99-L109) for extracting a message from a panic:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn build_panic_diagnostic(err: &Box<dyn Any + Send>) -> Diagnostic {\r\n    let error_message = if let Some(msg) = err.downcast_ref::<&str>() {\r\n        format!(\"Lambda panicked: {msg}\")\r\n    } else {\r\n        \"Lambda panicked\".to_string()\r\n    };\r\n    Diagnostic {\r\n        error_type: type_name_of_val(err),\r\n        error_message,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that this will lose the message when the panic payload is not an `&str`.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::{any::Any, hint, panic::{self, panic_any}};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    panic::set_hook(Box::new(|_| {}));\r\n\r\n    // String\r\n    // note: without black_box Rust will optimize the String into an &str :)\r\n    let exc = panic::catch_unwind(|| panic!(\"{x}\", x = hint::black_box(\"fmt\"))).unwrap_err();\r\n    handle_panic(&exc);\r\n\r\n    // &'static str\r\n    let exc = panic::catch_unwind(|| panic!(\"static\")).unwrap_err();\r\n    handle_panic(&exc);\r\n\r\n    // you can panic with anything\r\n    struct MyType;\r\n    let exc = panic::catch_unwind(|| panic_any(MyType)).unwrap_err();\r\n    handle_panic(&exc);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn handle_panic(payload: &Box<dyn Any + Send>) {\r\n    if let Some(inner) = payload.downcast_ref::<&str>() {\r\n        println!(\"&str: {}\", inner);\r\n    } else if let Some(inner) = payload.downcast_ref::<String>() {\r\n        println!(\"String: {}\", inner);\r\n    } else {\r\n        println!(\"Not a string\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString: fmt 0\r\n&str: static\r\nNot a string\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this were to happen in lambda code I believe that only the second case would be correctly handled by the panic layer.\r\n\r\nIn the most typical case of `panic!(\"message\")`, the payload will be an `&'static str`, but if formatting is used you will get a `String` instead, which can not be extracted via `.downcast_ref<&str>()`. Moreover, the panic payload can be any arbitrary type conforming to `'static + Any + Send`, via [`panic_any()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/panic/fn.panic_any.html), although this is rare and there isn't much that can be done in this case anyway.\r\n\r\nBy adding an additional branch to downcast to `String`, we ensure that we capture the error message in most cases. This also better aligns us with [the standard library's implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.84.1/library/std/src/panicking.rs#L747-L755).\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo clippy --fix`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/962/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/962/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/960", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/960/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/960/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/960/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/960", "id": 2802488087, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs6IhyP7", "number": 960, "title": "fix: Add type annotation to LambdaRequest's Deserialize impl to avoid compiler recursive loop", "user": {"login": "raulescobar-g", "id": 74686538, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg2NTM4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74686538?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g", "html_url": "https://github.com/raulescobar-g", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raulescobar-g/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2025-01-21T18:01:15Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-29T05:11:43Z", "closed_at": "2025-05-29T05:11:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/960", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/960", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/960.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/960.patch", "merged_at": "2025-05-29T05:11:42Z"}, "body": "I ran into an issue where the compiler would get into an infinite loop evaluating `lambda_http/src/deserializer.rs:23`.

Lambda invocation tracing. This enhancement allows users to specify the span kind (e.g., SERVER, CLIENT) in their Lambda handlers, improving how functions are represented in distributed traces.\r\nIn this way:\r\n- Users can set the span kind in their handlers using `span.record(\"otel.kind\", \"SERVER\")` or `span.record(\"otel.kind\", \"CONSUMER\") etc.\r\n- Allows to follow [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for span kind](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#spankind) while maintaining backward compatibility (the field can be left empty)\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Added `otel.kind` field to the Lambda invocation span, initialized as `field::Empty` as per the [tracing_opentelemetry docs](https://docs.rs/tracing-opentelemetry/latest/tracing_opentelemetry/#special-fields)\r\n- Updated the example in `examples/opentelemetry-tracing/main.rs`to demonstrate setting the span kind\r\n\r\nPlease note that since tracing_opentelemetry 0.28.0, [they have provided a method to set the status on a span](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing-opentelemetry/pull/176), therefore setting `otel.status_code` and `otel.status_message` in advance on the span is not required anymore.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f

Details in RFC (#917).\r\n\r\nNote: there was a bug in `RequestPayloadExt::payload` where if the content-type header was present but the body was empty, it would try to parse it anyways, resulting in a PayloadError.

of changes:*\r\n\r\nChange how we handle error types to be more ergonomic:\r\n\r\n- Replace Cow with String: Diagnostics are serialized into JSON as soon as the function returns, which means that their value is copied right away. The performance improvement of using Cow is minimal in this case, but it has some ergonomic implications because we have to handle their lifetimes. By removing the explicit lifetimes, people can return Diagnostic values with static lifetimes which was not possible before.\r\n\r\n- Add features to implement `From<T> for Diagnostic` for anyhow, eyre, and miette error types. This helps people that use those creates to transform their errors into `Diagnostic` without double boxing their errors.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo clippy --fix`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/907/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/907/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/905", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/905/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/905/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/905/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/905", "id": 2388347640, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs50T8UY", "number": 905, "title": "Improved error messages about payload deserialization", "user": {"login": "rimutaka", "id": 5926028, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjYwMjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5926028?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka", "html_url": "https://github.com/rimutaka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rimutaka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-07-03T11:06:49Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-03T15:07:58Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-03T15:07:58Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/905", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/905", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/905.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/905.patch", "merged_at": "2024-07-03T15:07:58Z"}, "body": "This PR makes errors about payload deserialization into a concrete event type more informative.\r\n\r\nFor example, my lambda had `LambdaEvent<ApiGatewayProxyRequest>` and was failing with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nERROR lambda_runtime::layers::api_response: building error response for Lambda Runtime API error=DeserializeError { inner: Error { path: Path { segments: [] }, original: Error(\"missing field `httpMethod`\", line: 1, column: 49) } }\r\n```\r\nThat error message makes perfect sense to the developer of the runtime.

The handler will not be called. Log at TRACE level to see the payload. error=DeserializeError { inner: Error { path: Path { segments: [] }, original: Error(\"missing field `httpMethod`\", line: 1, column: 49) } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also added a note about logging with TRACE to see the raw payload.

`lambda-extension` crate in [AWS Lambda RIE](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-runtime-interface-emulator):\r\n- AWS Lambda RIE returns status code `202 Accepted` instead of 200 when emulating the Telemetry API (see the response codes on [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api-reference.html)), which led to the error: `unable to initialize the telemetry api: 202 Accepted`. This patch accepts all status codes in the 200-299 range instead.

with `ApiGatewayV2CustomAuthorizerV2Request` not allowing for `None` as the `identity_source`. I suspect this being an issue as per the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/configure-api-gateway-lambda-authorization-with-console.html)\r\n\r\n> When caching is turned off, it is not necessary to specify an identity source. API Gateway directly passes the request to the authorizer Lambda function.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have run into issues with this in the wild as not having the identity source in the API Gateway Terraform configuration results in `DeserializeError { inner: Error { path: Path { segments: [Map { key: \\\"identitySource\\\" }] }, original: Error(\\\"invalid type: null, expected a sequence\\\"` in my Authorizer code. And after specifying an arbitrary field from the API Gateway event as the identity source it worked fine. \r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/860/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/860/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859", "id": 2233757278, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs5sJetg", "number": 859, "title": "Update tracing.rs - AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_LEVEL rather than RUST_LOG", "user": {"login": "lmammino", "id": 205629, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTYyOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/205629?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino", "html_url": "https://github.com/lmammino", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-04-09T15:46:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-12T07:45:33Z", "closed_at": "2024-04-12T07:45:33Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/859", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859.patch", "merged_at": "2024-04-12T07:45:33Z"}, "body": "*Issue #, if available:*\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nChanges the comment to mention the actual environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_LEVEL`.

Since this library just puts the same headers into both, this means that every header is returned twice (more or less, in the case of actual multi-value headers, only the first element is duplicated). In the case of CORS, this is fatal, as browsers generally reject duplicate CORS headers.

if available:* #747, #691\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:* This PR implements the layering RFC presented by @calavera in #747 with minor modifications to get the implementation running.\r\n\r\nNotes about the current implementation:\r\n\r\n- The public interface hardly changes: user handlers must now be `Send` and `'static` but that's it. Using the top-level `run` function should result in functionally (almost) equivalent code (except for some logging statements).\r\n- The now-public `Runtime` type adds a few internal layers upon initialization to (1) catch panics in user handlers, (2) transform user handler responses into Runtime API requests, and (3) send completion/error requests to the Runtime API. Users can add their own layers on top: the service input is a custom `LambdaInvocation` type which provides request-specific information along with the `Config` of the Lambda environment for convenience.\r\n- Some services could probably be implemented a little easier if one would accept that any services wrapped in the runtime implement `Clone`.\r\n\r\nI also added an example on how one could implement a custom layer to create OpenTelemetry spans and flush telemetry after each invocation, hence, this PR is also closely related to #691.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for originally outlining the implementation @calavera, that helped a lot! Please regard this PR as a proposal for implementation, I'm happy to make both minor and major adjustments. I mainly wanted to share this to further #747.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x]

if available:* N/D\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new lambda using `cargo lambda new` and selecting the event type `eventbridge::EventBridgeEvent` you end up with broken code:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 09 28 57](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/assets/205629/5d3fab56-f7f0-4d69-ab7b-bd9ac65040e4)\r\n\r\n> missing generics for struct `aws_lambda_events::eventbridge::EventBridgeEvent`\r\n> expected 1 generic argument\r\n\r\nThis makes sense because an EventBridge `detail` event field is an arbitrary JSON object, so it could vary widely in shape and therefore it is implemented as a generic type that we need to provide ourselves.\r\n\r\nSo an easy fix would be something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// ...\r\nuse serde_json::Value;\r\n\r\nasync fn function_handler(event: LambdaEvent<EventBridgeEvent<Value>>) -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n    // Extract some useful information from the request\r\n\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nexcept `serde_json` also needs to be installed with `cargo add serde_json`, so there's a bit of friction for the user.\r\n\r\nCloudWatch events are very similar (unsurprisingly since EventBrigde has spun off CloudWatch events, AFAIK) because they also have a generic `detail` field which can contain pretty much arbitrary content.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the current implementation of the `CloudWatchEvent` provides a default type and that type is `serde_json::Value`.\r\n\r\nI really like this approach because it provides a smoother starting point for the developer.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR proposes to adopt the same approach also to the `EventBridgeEvent` type and default `detail` to be of type `serde_json::Value` when no explicit type is provided for the associated generic type.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense, but IMHO it can make things a little bit more frictionless when wanting to scaffold an eventbridge Lambda.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this
