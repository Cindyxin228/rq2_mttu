removes the `#[lambda]` macro from this library. @davidbarsky provided the following valid reasons for why this should be done:\r\n\r\n* Compiler error reporting is not handled correctly using this macro, so the spans where an error occurs are undefined and point to incorrect locations.\r\n* Using this macro conflates warm and cold starts for Lambda functions, as this removes the ability to initialize global resources that might panic if initialized twice, such as a global logger.\r\n\r\nGiven that the alternative to using this macro is a single line addition to a `main` function, there is no real need to continue supporting this macro.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [*] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [*] I

ApiGateway and Alb all expect different types of responses to be returned from the invoked lambda function. Thus, it makes sense to pass the request origin to the creation of the response, so that the correct type of LambdaResponse is returned from the function.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds support for the \"cookies\" attribute which can be used for returning multiple Set-cookie headers from a lambda invoked via ApiGatewayV2, since ApiGatewayV2 no longer seems to recognize the \"multiValueHeaders\" attribute.\r\n\r\nOn lines 129-132 of `response.rs` the `SET_COOKIE` headers are removed from the `headers` returned to API Gateway v2, because otherwise API Gateway v2 would return three `set-cookie` headers when just returning two cookies in `cookies`, because one of the cookies would be duplicated in the `headers`. I tried using the `http::header::OccupiedEntry::remove_entry_mult` function for removing the `SET_COOKIE` headers from the `headers`, but I got some panicking from the http crate as described in https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/446. So I went with the solution where I first fetch the `SET_COOKIE` headers returned with `headers.get_all` and insert them cloned into the `cookies`, and then remove them with `headers.remove(SET_COOKIE)`. However, any ideas and suggestions as to improve this are warmly welcome!\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0

haven't used either of those options before.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if the statement about MSRV on line 11 is still accurate.\r\n\r\nI don't expect this to be ready to merge as-is, but hopefully

Since [AWS X-Ray is now availible in GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/aws-x-ray-now-available-in-aws-govcloud-us-regions/), we can make the trace id in the context non-optional.\r\n2. The (internal) runtime client is now takes a `&self` instead of a `&mut self`, reducing how many `.clone()`s we need need to write. This also means that the client no longer implements `tower::Service`, but given that functionality wasn't used _anyways_, I don't consider this to much of a loss.\r\n3. We're now modeling the incoming events as a stream using the (awesome!) [genawaiter](https://docs.rs/genawaiter/0.99.1/genawaiter/) crate. This can be replaced with a manual stream implementation + [pin_project_lite](https://docs.rs/pin-project-lite/0.1.4/pin_project_lite/) in the future. Side note: the Lambda Runtime server-side APIs (for those unfamiliar, the Firecracker boxes) suspend the function once they receive the `next_event` call, _not_ the response handler. This allows for races to be cleanly-side stepped.\r\n\r\nStill upcoming:\r\n\r\n1. `tracing` support for logs, metrics, and distributed tracing (e.g., AWS X-Ray Integration).\r\n2. Docs!\r\n3. Refactoring the test support to not rely sending requests over localhost as per https://github.com/davidbarsky/stuff. Props to Dylan Marriner on the Lambda team and @gardnervickers for the tip and approach.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [X] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of

You can now write a Lambda function similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```rust \r\nuse lambda::lambda;\r\nuse serde_json::Value;\r\n\r\ntype Error = Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static>;\r\n\r\n#[lambda]\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main(event: Value) -> Result<Value, Error> {\r\n    let _ = lambda::context();\r\n    Ok(event)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the high-level changes:\r\n\r\n- Async/await is the primary interface within a Lambda function. While Lambda does not support concurrent invocations in a single container (concurrency is the responsibility of Lambda-the-service), async/await _does_ allow for concurrent calls to other services.\r\n- Functions no longer need to return a `LambdaError`, as the the stabilization of [`std::any::type_name`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html) removed the need for a Lambda-specific error type.\r\n- Lambda functions can be created and started through the `#[lambda]` annotation. Note that starting a futures executor is still necessary. In the above example, this is handled through the `#[tokio::main]` macro.\r\n- The execution context is not an argument to the handler. Instead, it is a task-local, which is similar to a [thread local](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.LocalKey.html), but specific to a future instead of a thread. The task local can be fetched through free function `lambda::context()`.\r\n\r\n## Advanced Usage\r\n\r\n### The Handler Trait\r\n\r\nFor greater control over a handler, this PR provides a `Handler` trait. It is defined as:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Handler<A, B> {\r\n    /// Errors returned by this handler.\r\n    type Err;\r\n    /// The future response value of this handler.\r\n    type Fut: Future<Output = Result<B, Self::Err>>;\r\n    /// Process the incoming event and return the response asynchronously.\r\n    fn call(&mut self, event: A) -> Self::Fut;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is _not_ implemented in this PR yet, but I'd like to provide a blanket implementation of [`tower::Service`](https://docs.rs/tower/0.3.0/tower/trait.Service.html), which would provide compatibility with Tower's rich ecosystem of middleware. In particular, this would enable the use of [`tracing`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) for rich logging and trace reporting.\r\n\r\n### Without Macros\r\n\r\nFor those that prefer to not make use of the `#[lambda]` macro, a Lambda function can be started with the following code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse lambda::handler_fn;\r\n\r\ntype Error = Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static>;\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n    let func = handler_fn(func);\r\n    lambda::run(func).await?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn func(event: String) -> Result<String, Error> {\r\n    Ok(event)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remaining Work\r\n\r\nFor this PR to land, there are some additional bits of work needed: \r\n- Update documentation to show the usage of this runtime, especially some of the more advanced features.\r\n- Guide customers to _only_ build against the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target. The glibc in the Lambda execution environment is too old to run Rust executables.\r\n- Convert `Executor::run` (see `lambda/src/lib.rs`) to a stream so that Lambda functions can be easily unit-tested _in-memory_. By converting it to a stream, limiting execution via [`SteamExt::take`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.take) or [stream-cancel](https://docs.rs/stream-cancel/0.5.0/stream_cancel/index.html) becomes _much_ easier.\r\n- Provide examples (beyond this library's unit tests) of how to test a Lambda function.\r\n- Provide examples of using the runtime with [tokio-compat](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-compat) and Rusoto, if Rusoto doesn't support async/await prior to this PR landing.\r\n- Figure out how to support `http`-based Lambdas through the `#[lambda]` macro. I think an attribute like `#[lambda::http]` dispatching to an `Executor::run_http` method is the best approach until specialization is stable.\r\n- Release `tracing`/AWS X-Ray integration.\r\n\r\ncc: @softprops @iliana @sapessi.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/111/reactions", "total_count": 17, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 17, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/111/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
