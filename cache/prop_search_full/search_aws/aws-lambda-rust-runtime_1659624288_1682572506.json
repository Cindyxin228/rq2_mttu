Additionally, I have fixed all of the non-visual markdown lint warnings/errors. I did not fix all of them to preserve the styling of the original authors in the case that it was done intentionally.\r\n\r\nI have also converted `Utc.ymd` to the non-deprecated `Utc.with_ymd_and_hms`. Tested and functional.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\nWhen a reader looks at [Deploying with Cargo Lambda](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime#22-deploying-with-cargo-lambda), the reader has likely not read the official `cargo-lambda` documentation. It is then possible that there may be an assumption, through disjunction, that it is possible to execute `cargo lambda invoke` without the `--remote` flag.\r\n\r\nThe user may then try this command on the first given [example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime#22-deploying-with-cargo-lambda) to find that the command runs successfully. Later on, they may write a HTTP function and assume that the command is a signal of correctness, only to find that the command fails.\r\n\r\nInevitably, after several futile attempts at debugging,  the user may come back to the documentation and notice there is no documentation describing their issue until they finally choose to look at the `cargo-lambda` documentation where they must notice the following in a glance, along with the context of the first paragraph.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56998716/219791870-ff6a13d2-916a-4170-a554-694d9f819151.png)\r\n\r\nWith the updated documentation, the user will likely perform a search for `data did not match any variant of untagged enum LambdaRequest` and quickly realise their blunder.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\n\r\nBy

logging errors, it is very useful to log the request Id (and xray id if available). But, not every one might want it, so we probably don't want to include it by default in every log.\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed in this PR is to use a `span` with fields containing the request id and xray id. Then, to get the request id part of the log messages, one has to enable logging spans in the logger setup (using [tracing_subscriber](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/fmt/struct.Layer.html#method.with_span_list) for example).\r\n\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [X] I
