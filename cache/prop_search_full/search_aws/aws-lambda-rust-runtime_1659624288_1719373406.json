This also matches e.g. how [`tower_http` does it](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/blob/a1e3f8a28bdb118c98627b8fa2d05180049dc981/tower-http/src/trace/service.rs#L308).\r\n\r\nBy submitting this

Telemetry API (see the response codes on [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api-reference.html)), which led to the error: `unable to initialize the telemetry api: 202 Accepted`. This patch accepts all status codes in the 200-299 range instead. I also changed similar occurrences for consistency.\r\n- It looks like the `tracing` field on `InvokeEvent` is not set, so I made it optional.

If the same key-value pair is specified in both, only the values from multiValueHeaders will appear in the merged list.\r\n\r\n**APIGW v2 Integration**\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html\r\n\r\n>Format 2.0 doesn't have multiValueHeaders or multiValueQueryStringParameters fields.

with `ApiGatewayV2CustomAuthorizerV2Request` not allowing for `None` as the `identity_source`. I suspect this being an issue as per the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/configure-api-gateway-lambda-authorization-with-console.html)\r\n\r\n> When caching is turned off, it is not necessary to specify an identity source. API Gateway directly passes the request to the authorizer Lambda function.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have run into issues with this in the wild as not having the identity source in the API Gateway Terraform configuration results in `DeserializeError { inner: Error { path: Path { segments: [Map { key: \\\"identitySource\\\" }] }, original: Error(\\\"invalid type: null, expected a sequence\\\"` in my Authorizer code. And after specifying an arbitrary field from the API Gateway event as the identity source it worked fine. \r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/860/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/860/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/859/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859", "id": 2233757278, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs5sJetg", "number": 859, "title": "Update tracing.rs - AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_LEVEL rather than RUST_LOG", "user": {"login": "lmammino", "id": 205629, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTYyOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/205629?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino", "html_url": "https://github.com/lmammino", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmammino/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-04-09T15:46:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-12T07:45:33Z", "closed_at": "2024-04-12T07:45:33Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/859", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/859.patch", "merged_at": "2024-04-12T07:45:33Z"}, "body": "*Issue #, if available:*\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nChanges the comment to mention the actual environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_LEVEL`.

Since this library just puts the same headers into both, this means that every header is returned twice (more or less, in the case of actual multi-value headers, only the first element is duplicated). In the case of CORS, this is fatal, as browsers generally reject duplicate CORS headers.

if available:* #747, #691\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:* This PR implements the layering RFC presented by @calavera in #747 with minor modifications to get the implementation running.\r\n\r\nNotes about the current implementation:\r\n\r\n- The public interface hardly changes: user handlers must now be `Send` and `'static` but that's it. Using the top-level `run` function should result in functionally (almost) equivalent code (except for some logging statements).\r\n- The now-public `Runtime` type adds a few internal layers upon initialization to (1) catch panics in user handlers, (2) transform user handler responses into Runtime API requests, and (3) send completion/error requests to the Runtime API. Users can add their own layers on top: the service input is a custom `LambdaInvocation` type which provides request-specific information along with the `Config` of the Lambda environment for convenience.\r\n- Some services could probably be implemented a little easier if one would accept that any services wrapped in the runtime implement `Clone`.\r\n\r\nI also added an example on how one could implement a custom layer to create OpenTelemetry spans and flush telemetry after each invocation, hence, this PR is also closely related to #691.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for originally outlining the implementation @calavera, that helped a lot! Please regard this PR as a proposal for implementation, I'm happy to make both minor and major adjustments. I mainly wanted to share this to further #747.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x]

if available:* N/D\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new lambda using `cargo lambda new` and selecting the event type `eventbridge::EventBridgeEvent` you end up with broken code:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 09 28 57](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/assets/205629/5d3fab56-f7f0-4d69-ab7b-bd9ac65040e4)\r\n\r\n> missing generics for struct `aws_lambda_events::eventbridge::EventBridgeEvent`\r\n> expected 1 generic argument\r\n\r\nThis makes sense because an EventBridge `detail` event field is an arbitrary JSON object, so it could vary widely in shape and therefore it is implemented as a generic type that we need to provide ourselves.\r\n\r\nSo an easy fix would be something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// ...\r\nuse serde_json::Value;\r\n\r\nasync fn function_handler(event: LambdaEvent<EventBridgeEvent<Value>>) -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n    // Extract some useful information from the request\r\n\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nexcept `serde_json` also needs to be installed with `cargo add serde_json`, so there's a bit of friction for the user.\r\n\r\nCloudWatch events are very similar (unsurprisingly since EventBrigde has spun off CloudWatch events, AFAIK) because they also have a generic `detail` field which can contain pretty much arbitrary content.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the current implementation of the `CloudWatchEvent` provides a default type and that type is `serde_json::Value`.\r\n\r\nI really like this approach because it provides a smoother starting point for the developer.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR proposes to adopt the same approach also to the `EventBridgeEvent` type and default `detail` to be of type `serde_json::Value` when no explicit type is provided for the associated generic type.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense, but IMHO it can make things a little bit more frictionless when wanting to scaffold an eventbridge Lambda.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this

if available:*\r\n- #824\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n- `F::Error` of `Runtime::run` and `run` is required to implement `Into<Diagnostic<'a>>` instead of `std::fmt::Display`\r\n- `Into<Diagnostic<'a>>` is implemented for any types that implement `std::fmt::Display` as a fallback and for backward compatibility\r\n- `Diagnostic` and its fields become public so that users can customize error responses\r\n- `error_type` and `error_message` of `Diagnostic` are wrapped in `std::borrow::Cow` so that they can hold both borrowed and owned strings. An example of the situation where an owned string is necessary is in the fallback implementation of `From<Display>` for `Diagnostic`, which generates `error_message` inside `from` method and it has to outlive the method call.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/828/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/828/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/827", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/827/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/827/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/827/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/827", "id": 2145861628, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs5neZzG", "number": 827, "title": "Api Gateway authorizer improvements", "user": {"login": "calavera", "id": 1050, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera", "html_url": "https://github.com/calavera", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-21T05:20:42Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-21T16:55:55Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-21T16:55:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/827", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/827", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/827.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/827.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-21T16:55:54Z"}, "body": "*Issue #, if available:*\r\n\r\nThe discussion in https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/discussions/823 made me think that we can provide much better ergonomics to work with Api Gateway Authorizers, since it looks like a common use case.\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nThere are changes in the events crate that are not backwards compatible, but I believe they provide much better user experience.

awkward to do the following: \r\n\r\n```Rust\r\n    let payload = event.payload;\r\n    match payload\r\n        .cognito_event_user_pools_header\r\n        .trigger_source\r\n        .as_ref()\r\n        .unwrap()\r\n        .as_str()\r\n    {\r\n        \"PostConfirmation_ConfirmSignUp\" => { todo!() }\r\n        \"It's awkward and error prone to match on strings\" => { todo!() }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd so I thought I might just suggest a PR making it an enum? \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nI didn't really find relevant documentation, so let me know if there any in

changes:*\r\n\r\nTo support addtional event triggers in lambda web adapter, such as SQS or Bedrock Agents, we need to pass-through events from those triggers. This PR adds a `pass_through` feature to `lambda-http` crate. When enabled, the events payloads will be translated to a HTTP post request (event payloads in the request body). \r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the deserializer.rs. It uses `RawValue` to get the data from `deserializer`, not relaying on private serde functions. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under

Lambda Extension - Implement Serialize for LambdaTelemetryRecord\r\n\r\nDescription of changes:\r\nThis PR implements the Serialize trait for the [LambdaTelemetry](https://docs.rs/lambda-extension/latest/lambda_extension/struct.LambdaTelemetry.html) struct, as well as its fields, most importantly the [LambdaTelemetryRecord](https://docs.rs/lambda-extension/latest/lambda_extension/enum.LambdaTelemetryRecord.html) enum and its component variants.\r\n\r\nI have made a couple choices here and I'm not sure that they are necessarily the best, I'm happy to hear any comments on them:\r\n- On variants of LambdaTelemetryRecord, I have skipped serialization on fields which are `Option::None`, as opposed to serializing them to `null`\r\n- I have included empty arrays of spans on those variants that have spans\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request:\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made

Since the `Extension::run` function both registers and executes the extension, there was previously no way for the runtime to determine that all internal extensions have been registered and that it's safe to proceed to the Invoke lifecycle phase.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces an `Extension::register` method that registers the extension and begins any logs/telemetry handlers. It then returns a new `RegisteredExtension` abstraction that can be used to invoke the extension's run loop concurrently with the runtime's run loop.\r\n\r\nThis change maintains backward compatibility by having the existing `Extension::run` method perform both steps. External Lambda extensions can use either API, and internal extensions should use the new API.\r\n\r\nResolves #743.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [X ] I confirm that my contribution
