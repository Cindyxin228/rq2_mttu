preventing\r\nthe caller from possibly handling them. For instance, when the API is\r\nrate limited, returning an error that indicates this is a RateLimiting\r\nerror, and providing a simple way to know until when we are being rate\r\nlimited is valuable. At the moment, one needs to extract the message from the\r\nanyhow error, do some regex magic to detect if this is being rate\r\nlimited or not, and extract until when the rate limitation applies.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the use of the crate `thiserror` and ports the\r\ngithub crate to use it.\r\nAll crates will now return a `ClientResult` instead of a\r\n`anyhow::Result`. For crates ported to `thiserror`, Client result is an\r\nalias to `Result<T, ClientError>`, where `ClientError` is the enum\r\ndefined using `thiserror` to populate variants.\r\nIf a crate is not onboarded in `thiserror`, `ClientResult` is a simple\r\nalias to `anyhow::Result`.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/issues/57/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/issues/57/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/issues/56", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/issues/56/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/issues/56/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/issues/56/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/pull/56", "id": 1595804261, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFu9NZc5KjP9s", "number": 56, "title": "Fix installation types", "user": {"login": "augustuswm", "id": 1377730, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzc3MzA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1377730?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm", "html_url": "https://github.com/augustuswm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/augustuswm/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-02-22T20:42:38Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-23T13:08:15Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-23T13:08:11Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/pulls/56", "html_url": "https://github.com/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/pull/56", "diff_url": "https://github.com/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/pull/56.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/oxidecomputer/third-party-api-clients/pull/56.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-23T13:08:11Z"}, "body": "* Update `app_id` and `installation_id` in `auth` from `u64` to `i64`\r\n\r\nThe spec defines these as integers which causes them to be generated as `i64` fields.
