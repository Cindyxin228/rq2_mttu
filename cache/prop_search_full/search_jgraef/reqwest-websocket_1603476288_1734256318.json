`UpgradeResponse::into_inner` method can't work on wasm, so wrap it in a `cfg(not(target_arch = \"wasm32\"))`\r\n- the `http1_only` method does not exist on reqwest's ClientBuilder in wasm mode, so write a utility function that only does that in non-wasm32 mode\r\n- reqwest-websocket unconditionally relies on the `sink` feature of `futures-util`, so declare that it needs that feature in Cargo.toml.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese changes have allowed reqwest-websocket to compile as a dependency of my own project, but for some reason running `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` on reqwest-websocket directly fails with some very confusing error messages. I think that to ensure reqwest-websocket continues working with wasm32 in the future, this will need to be addressed and added to CI, but I haven't been able to figure out the problem yet.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/8/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/8/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/4", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/4/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/4/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/4/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/pull/4", "id": 2203831197, "node_id": "PR_kwDOLSCjaM5qjyzC", "number": 4, "title": "update reqwest", "user": {"login": "creativcoder", "id": 5155745, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTU3NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5155745?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder", "html_url": "https://github.com/creativcoder", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/creativcoder/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-03-23T11:17:26Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-06T13:57:38Z", "closed_at": "2024-04-06T13:56:49Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/pulls/4", "html_url": "https://github.com/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/pull/4", "diff_url": "https://github.com/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/pull/4.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/pull/4.patch", "merged_at": "2024-04-06T13:56:49Z"}, "body": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jgraef/reqwest-websocket/issues/4/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
