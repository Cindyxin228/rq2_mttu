That\nin turn means that match offsets that split a codepoint could be reported,\nwhich in turn results in panicking when one uses them to slice a `&str`.\n\nThis bug occurred in the transition to `regex 1.8` because the underlying\nsyntactical error that prevented this regex from compiling was intentionally\nremoved. That's because `(?-u:\\B)` will be permitted in Unicode regexes in\n`regex 1.9`, but the matching engines will guarantee to never report match\noffsets that split a codepoint. When the underlying syntactical error was\nremoved, no code was added to ensure that `(?-u:\\B)` didn't compile in the\n`regex 1.8` transition release. This release, `regex 1.8.4`, adds that code\nsuch that `Regex::new(r\"(?-u:\\B)\")` returns to the `regex <1.8` behavior of\nnot compiling. (A `bytes::Regex` can still of course compile it.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1006](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1006):\n    Fix a bug where `(?-u:\\B)` was allowed in Unicode regexes, and in turn could\n    lead to match offsets that split a codepoint in `&str`.\n\n### [`v1.8.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;183-2023-05-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.2...1.8.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where the regex would report a\nmatch at every position even when it shouldn't. This could occur in a very\nsmall subset of regexes, usually an alternation of simple literals that\nhave particular properties. (See the issue linked below for a more precise\ndescription.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;999](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999):\n    Fix a bug where a match at every position is erroneously reported.\n\n### [`v1.8.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;182-2023-05-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.1...1.8.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where regex compilation could panic\nin debug mode for regexes with large counted repetitions. For example,\n`a{2147483516}{2147483416}{5}` resulted in an integer overflow that wrapped\nin release mode but panicking in debug mode. Despite the unintended wrapping\narithmetic in release mode, it didn't cause any other logical bugs since the\nerrant code was for new analysis that wasn't used yet.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;995](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/995):\n    Fix a bug where regex compilation with large counted repetitions could panic.\n\n### [`v1.8.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;181-2023-04-21)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where a regex match could be reported\nwhere none was found. Specifically, the bug occurs when a pattern contains some\nliteral prefixes that could be extracted *and* an optional word boundary in the\nprefix.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;981](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/981):\n    Fix a bug where a word boundary could interact with prefix literal\n    optimizations and lead to a false positive match.\n\n### [`v1.8.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;180-2023-04-20)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a sizeable release that will be soon followed by another sizeable\nrelease. Both of them will combined close over 40 existing issues and PRs.\n\nThis first release, despite its size, essentially represents preparatory work\nfor the second release, which will be even bigger. Namely, this release:\n\n-   Increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.0, which was released about 1 year ago.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `aho-corasick` to the recently released 1.0\n    version.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `regex-syntax` to the simultaneously released\n    `0.7` version. The changes to `regex-syntax` principally revolve around a\n    rewrite of its literal extraction code and a number of simplifications and\n    optimizations to its high-level intermediate representation (HIR).\n\nThe second release, which will follow ~shortly after the release above, will\ncontain a soup-to-nuts rewrite of every regex engine. This will be done by\nbringing [`regex-automata`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata) into\nthis repository, and then changing the `regex` crate to be nothing but an API\nshim layer on top of `regex-automata`'s API.\n\nThese tandem releases are the culmination of about 3\nyears of on-and-off work that [began in earnest in March\n2020](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656).\n\nBecause of the scale of changes involved in these releases, I would love to\nhear about your experience. Especially if you notice undocumented changes in\nbehavior or performance changes (positive *or* negative).\n\nMost changes in the first release are listed below. For more details, please\nsee the commit log, which reflects a linear and decently documented history\nof all changes.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;501](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/501):\n    Permit many more characters to be escaped, even if they have no significance.\n    More specifically, any ASCII character except for `[0-9A-Za-z<>]` can now be\n    escaped. Also, a new routine, `is_escapeable_character`, has been added to\n    `regex-syntax` to query whether a character is escapeable or not.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/547):\n    Add `Regex::captures_at`. This filles a hole in the API, but doesn't otherwise\n    introduce any new expressive power.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;595](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/595):\n    Capture group names are now Unicode-aware. They can now begin with either a `_`\n    or any \"alphabetic\" codepoint. After the first codepoint, subsequent codepoints\n    can be any sequence of alpha-numeric codepoints, along with `_`, `.`, `[` and\n    `]`. Note that replacement syntax has not changed.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/810):\n    Add `Match::is_empty` and `Match::len` APIs.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/905):\n    Add an `impl Default for RegexSet`, with the default being the empty set.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;908](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/908):\n    A new method, `Regex::static_captures_len`, has been added which returns the\n    number of capture groups in the pattern if and only if every possible match\n    always contains the same number of matching groups.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;955](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/955):\n    Named captures can now be written as `(?<name>re)` in addition to\n    `(?P<name>re)`.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now supports empty character classes.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has an optional `std` feature. (This will come\n    to `regex` in the second release.)\n-   FEATURE: The `Hir` type in `regex-syntax` has had a number of simplifications\n    made to it.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` has support for a new `R` flag for enabling CRLF\n    mode. This will be supported in `regex` proper in the second release.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has proper support for \"regex that never\n    matches\" via `Hir::fail()`.\n-   FEATURE: The `hir::literal` module of `regex-syntax` has been completely\n    re-worked. It now has more documentation, examples and advice.\n-   FEATURE: The `allow_invalid_utf8` option in `regex-syntax` has been renamed\n    to `utf8`, and the meaning of the boolean has been flipped.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   PERF: The upgrade to `aho-corasick 1.0` may improve performance in some\n    cases. It's difficult to characterize exactly which patterns this might impact,\n    but if there are a small number of longish (>= 4 bytes) prefix literals, then\n    it might be faster than before.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;514](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/514):\n    Improve `Debug` impl for `Match` so that it doesn't show the entire haystack.\n-   BUGS [#&#8203;516](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/516),\n    [#&#8203;731](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/731):\n    Fix a number of issues with printing `Hir` values as regex patterns.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;610](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/610):\n    Add explicit example of `foo|bar` in the regex syntax docs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;625](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/625):\n    Clarify that `SetMatches::len` does not (regretably) refer to the number of\n    matches in the set.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;660](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/660):\n    Clarify \"verbose mode\" in regex syntax documentation.\n-   BUG [#&#8203;738](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/738),\n    [#&#8203;950](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/950):\n    Fix `CaptureLocations::get` so that it never panics.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;747](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/747):\n    Clarify documentation for `Regex::shortest_match`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;835](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/835):\n    Fix `\\p{Sc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Currency_Symbol}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;846](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/846):\n    Add more clarifying documentation to the `CompiledTooBig` error variant.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;854](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/854):\n    Clarify that `regex::Regex` searches as if the haystack is a sequence of\n    Unicode scalar values.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;884](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/884):\n    Replace `__Nonexhaustive` variants with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;893](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/893):\n    Optimize case folding since it can get quite slow in some pathological cases.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;895](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/895):\n    Reject `(?-u:\\W)` in `regex::Regex` APIs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;942](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/942):\n    Add a missing `void` keyword to indicate \"no parameters\" in C API.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;965](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/965):\n    Fix `\\p{Lc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Cased_Letter}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;975](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/975):\n    Clarify documentation for `\\pX` syntax.\n\n### [`v1.7.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;173-2023-03-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.2...1.7.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small release that fixes a bug in `Regex::shortest_match_at` that\ncould cause it to panic, even when the offset given is valid.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;969](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/969):\n    Fix a bug in how the reverse DFA was called for `Regex::shortest_match_at`.\n\n### [`v1.7.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;172-2023-03-21)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.1...1.7.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small release that fixes a failing test on FreeBSD.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;967](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/967):\n    Fix \"no stack overflow\" test which can fail due to the small stack size.\n\n### [`v1.7.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;171-2023-01-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.0...1.7.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis release was done principally to try and fix the doc.rs rendering for the\nregex crate.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;930](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/930):\n    Optimize `replacen`.
