Cover them with tests.\r\n- [x] If adding tests is not possible, please document in the PR body a minimal example with steps on how to reproduce so one can verify your change works.\r\n\r\nMake sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:\r\n\r\n- [x] `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo fmt --all` applies these changes)\r\n- [x] `cargo clippy
