For the last few weeks I've been working axum 0.2 which cleans up and improves pretty much all parts of axum. There is a number of breaking changes as well. Everything is detailed in our [changelog](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\nWhile axum 0.2 isn't shipped yet, all the API level changes are done. I expect to `cargo publish` next week. As part of that I'm going through crates on crates.io to make sure everything still works on 0.2.\r\n\r\nThis PR currently uses a git dependency but once 0.2 is shipped then I'll remove that and depend directly on 0.2 from crates.io. Hence the draft PR.\r\n\r\nThanks for using axum! Just let me know if you have questions \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [x] Updated README.md with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [x] Updated `site` content with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [x] Squash down commits to one or two logical commits which clearly describe the work you've done. If you don't, then Dodd will \ud83e\udd13.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-22T14:05:03Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-20T14:52:36Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-20T14:52:22Z", "merged_at": "2021-09-20T14:52:22Z",
