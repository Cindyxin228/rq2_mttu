I've compiled it myself and confirm the vulnerable crate no longer is a dependency in `Cargo.lock`.\r\n\r\n# Target\r\nRemove the vulnerability to prevent vulnerability-tool noise.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\nIn accordance with the workaround, disable the default features of `chrono` and instead replace it with the \"clock\" feature, which does not compile the vulnerable crate.
