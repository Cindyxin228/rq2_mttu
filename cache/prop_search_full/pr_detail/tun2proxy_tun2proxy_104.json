I was trying to came up with some solution to make a network environment isolated from a global system setup with all traffic reaching outside routing via the a socks proxy or vpn instance in unprivileged (rootless) manner.\r\n\r\nUsually this would require using something like veth pairs (virtual network interfaces) to bridge namespaces. But required modifications affect the global network namespace therefore require root-like capabilities. That aren't normally available to the user processes.\r\n\r\nThis why I came up with a solution utilizing TUN interface. And since it similar to what this project does, I decided to integrate that functionality here.\r\n\r\nHere are use-cases I wanted to add support for:\r\n- Create an isolated and proxified environment for applications that don't understand proxies by themselves.\r\n- Separate vpn instances from global network namespace.\r\n- Support flatpak application (this is tricky because some containerization solutions are messing up capabilities such that flatpak fails to run).\r\n- Do everything above without requiring root-like capabilities.\r\n\r\n## Implemented features\r\n- Unprivileged mode which creates an isolated network environment (from the global network configuration) and bridges all the traffic reaching outside of it through the proxy. See `--unshare`.\r\n- No-proxy mode which sends routes traffic directly to the requested address. See `--proxy none`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nCreate a new network namespace where all traffic reaching outside is routed through the socks5 proxy.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ tun2proxy --unshare --startup --proxy \"socks5://...\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a new network namespace without additional redirection of traffic with `openvpn` running in it (with root-like capabilities provided to allow network configuration).\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ tun2proxy --unshare --startup --proxy \"none\" -- openvpn [...]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart `/bin/sh` in the namespace created by the `tun2proxy` started the latest. Persistent command is suggested in `tun2proxy` output.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ nsenter --target $(pgrep -n tun2proxy) --preserve-credentials --user  --net --mount /bin/sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\nThere are three core ideas in play:\r\n- When a process creates namespace it gains root-like capabilities. I.e. the ability to modify filesystem and network devices it the namespaces. This capability can be passed to descendant processes allowing them to create a TUN devices in unprivileged environment.\r\n- A pair of interconnected `unix(7)` sockets may not only exchange data but also copies of valid file descriptors.\r\nThis mechanism is useful to transfer sockets bonded to the global network to another network namespace.\r\n- File descriptors without `CLOEXEC` flag (it is usually set by the std implementation) are inherited in descending processes.\r\n\r\nUsing those ideas execution flow can be described as follows:\r\n- First `tun2proxy` process with argument `--unshare` generates a pair of interconnected unix sockets unsetting `CLOEXEC` flag on one of those and converting it to raw file descriptor value.\r\n- Then it starts `unshare(1)` process that creates a new namespace.\r\n- `unshare` process is instructed to start `tun2proxy` binary again but this time with `--socket-transfer-fd <fd>` argument where `<fd>` is the raw file descriptor discussed earlier.\r\n- `tun2proxy` process inside the new namespace initializes TUN interface and routing table as normal.\r\n- But since network namespace it is running in is isolated, it can't connect to the proxy server directly. This what unix sockets are required for.\r\n- After initialization is done, it starts transferring network sockets from the first `tun2proxy` process that is still in the global network namespace and sockets created by which are bonded to the global namespace even after the transfer to the descendant process occurs.\r\n- The network admin process (see `[admin command]` cli argument) is started after the network is ready, preserving root-like capabilities, that process could be for example a vpn daemon.\r\n- Then `tun2proxy` operates as usual.\r\n\r\n## Code changes\r\n\r\n- `bin/main.rs` - added a startup routine triggered if `--unshare` is specified.\r\n- `args.rs` - added new cli arguments: `--proxy none`, `--unshare`, `--socket-transfer-fd <fd>`, `[admin\\_command...]`, `udp_timeout`.\r\n- `desktop_api.rs` - added code to spawn an `admin_command` and fix to allow running other proxy in a new namespace. \r\n- `lib.rs` - added functionality to fetch network sockets in case `--socket-tranfer-fd` was specified. Also a small fix to bunch series of `Mutex::lock` into one call where applicable.\r\n- `no_proxy.rs` (created) - implementation of no-proxy mode, basically a no-op since it signals that connection is always established.\r\n- `proxy_handle.rs` (and implementations of proxy protocols) - add `get_server_addr` function to `ProxyHandler` trait, previously server address was supplied directly from cli arguments.\r\n- `socket_transfer.rs` (created) - functionality to safely transfer raw sockets between processes.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- `tproxy-config` is lacking the support not to set ipv6 routing. This confuses some user application if proxy doesn't support ipv6 connectivity, e.g. causes timeout in resolution and subsequent fail of dns requests (this also could be attributed to `ipstack` not reporting unreachable destinations).\r\n\r\n- `tproxy-config` is always setting *more specific* (compared to `0.0.0.0/0`) routing addresses even if no default route is presented in the network namespace. This causes mutual exclusion in routing tables for `0.0.0.0/1` and `128.0.0.0/1` address spaces with other proxy application (notably `openvpn`).\r\n", "created_at": "2024-04-03T16:22:56Z",
