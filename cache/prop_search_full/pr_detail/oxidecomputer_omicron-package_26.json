After the 0.4.20-0.4.22 series that brought chrono back to life after a long hiatus, development has been fairly quiet, allowing us to start planning changes for the 0.5.0 release. As such, we've started deprecating some APIs that are likely to be removed in 0.5. If you have any feedback on these changes, please let us know in the issue tracker!\n\n##### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate methods that have an `_opt()` alternative ([#&#8203;827](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/827))\n-   Deprecate usage of the `Date<Tz>` type ([#&#8203;851](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/851))\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Optimize RFC 3339 (and RFC 2822) encoding ([#&#8203;844](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/844), thanks to [@&#8203;conradludgate](https://togithub.com/conradludgate))\n-   Addition and subtraction with the `Days` type ([#&#8203;784](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/784))\n-   Add `NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp_millis(_opt)` ([#&#8203;818](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/818), thanks to [@&#8203;Pscheidl](https://togithub.com/Pscheidl) -- backported in [#&#8203;823](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/823))\n-   Allow for changing TZ variable and cache it for `Local` timezone ([#&#8203;853](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/853))\n-   Add optional support for the `arbitrary::Arbitrary` trait ([#&#8203;849](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/849), thanks to [@&#8203;greyblake](https://togithub.com/greyblake) and [@&#8203;asayers](https://togithub.com/asayers))\n\n##### Fixes\n\n-   Support tzdb location on AIX ([#&#8203;826](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/826))\n-   Fix warnings in documentation ([#&#8203;847](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/847))\n\nOn behalf of [@&#8203;esheppa](https://togithub.com/esheppa) and [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc), thanks to all contributors!\n\n### [`v0.4.22`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.22): 0.4.22\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.21...v0.4.22)\n\nUnfortunately the introduction of the iana-time-zone dependency in 0.4.21 caused some new regressions with lesser known platforms. This release fixes all of the issues we've encountered, improving the situation on some WebAssembly targets, SGX and on macOS/iOS. We've improved our CI setup to hopefully catch more of these issues before release in the future.\n\n-   Make wasm-bindgen optional on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target ([#&#8203;771](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/771))\n-   Avoid iana-time-zone dependency on `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx` ([#&#8203;767](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/767), thanks to [@&#8203;trevor-crypto](https://togithub.com/trevor-crypto))\n-   Update `iana-time-zone` version to 0.1.44 to avoid cyclic dependencies ([#&#8203;773](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/773), thanks to [@&#8203;Kijewski](https://togithub.com/Kijewski) for the upstream PRs)\n-   Clarify documentation about year range in formatting/parsing ([#&#8203;765](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/765))\n\n### [`v0.4.21`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.21): 0.4.21\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.20...v0.4.21)\n\n0.4.21 is a bugfix release that mainly fixes one regression from 0.4.20:\n\n-   Fall back to UTC in case no timezone is found. Unfortunately this is a regression from the changes we made in 0.4.20 where we now parse the timezone database ourselves. Before 0.4.20, `TimeZone::now()` fell back to UTC in the case it could not find the current timezone, but the new implementation panicked in that case.\n-   Correctly detect timezone on Android (also [#&#8203;756](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/756)). Android does have the timezone database installed, but it's in a different path, and it does not use `/etc/localtime` to keep track of the current timezone. Instead we now use the iana-time-zone crate as a dependency, since it already has quite a bit of logic for finding the current timezone on a host of platforms.\n\nAdditionally, there is a documentation fix that reverts an incorrect guarantee:\n\n-   Document that `%Y` can have a negative value, both in formatting and in parsing ([#&#8203;760](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/760), thanks to [@&#8203;alex](https://togithub.com/alex))\n\n### [`v0.4.20`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.20): 0.4.20\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.19...v0.4.20)\n\nchrono is a date and time library for Rust and 0.4.20 is the first chrono release since Sep 2020. There has been a long hiatus since the previous maintainer was no longer able to spend much time on the crate; thanks to [@&#8203;quodlibetor](https://togithub.com/quodlibetor) for their stewardship of the chrono crate for many years! The new maintainers are [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;esheppa](https://togithub.com/esheppa). Our first priority has been fixing the soundness issues with calls to `localtime_r()` as first reported in [#&#8203;499](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/499) and the [RUSTSEC-2020-0159 ](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159) advisory. In order to do this we adapted code from the tz-rs crate maintained by [@&#8203;x-hgg-x](https://togithub.com/x-hgg-x) for use within chrono -- thanks for working on that! With the new implementation, chrono uses safe Rust code to parse the timezone data files on Unix platforms directly instead of relying on libc.\n\nDue to compatibility reasons, this release does not yet remove the time 0.1 dependency, though chrono 0.4.20 does not depend on the vulnerable parts of the time 0.1.x versions. In a future 0.5 release, we will remove the time dependency.\n\nThe minimum supported Rust version for 0.4.20 is 1.32.0, which is intentionally still quite conservative. If you are using chrono 0.4 with a Rust version older than 1.52, we'd like to hear from you since we'd like to further modernize the code base to ease maintenance.\n\n#### Fixes\n\n-   Fix unsound call to `localtime_r()` by parsing timezone files in Rust on Unix ([#&#8203;677](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/677) and [#&#8203;728](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/728))\n-   Allow RFC 2822 parser to deal with comments ([#&#8203;733](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/733) then

([#&#8203;686](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/686), thanks to [@&#8203;botahamec](https://togithub.com/botahamec))\n-   Avoid panics when rounding durations  ([#&#8203;659](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/659), thanks to [@&#8203;ARBaart](https://togithub.com/ARBaart))\n-   Fix `Duration::abs()` behavior in case of negative durations with nanoseconds ([#&#8203;734](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/734), thanks to [@&#8203;abreis](https://togithub.com/abreis))\n\n#### Additions\n\n-   Make `ParserErrorKind` public and available through `ParseError::kind()` ([#&#8203;588](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/588), thanks to [@&#8203;sbrocket](https://togithub.com/sbrocket))\n-   Expose associated `MIN` and `MAX` const values in favor of free-standing consts ([#&#8203;726](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/726))\n-   Add (optional) support for rkyv
