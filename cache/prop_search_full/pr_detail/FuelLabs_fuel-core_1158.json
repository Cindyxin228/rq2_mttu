It is not critical, but replacing them with the correct scripts later would be nice.\r\n- One test uploads the contract with a huge large state and executes it. The test takes a lot of time to execute and highlights that we have performance problems with the state calculation: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1143\r\n- Another test is more of a base for spamming the testnets. We can put any hex-encoded transaction and dry run it on the network. It contains a simple transfer transaction right now.\r\n\r\nThe change improves the `fuel-core snapshot` command to accept the arguments, and you can either snap the whole state of the blockchain via the `everyone` command, or the state only of the contract. In the follow-up PRs we can snapping of the coins and messages too.\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n- Use a lru cache to store the uncompressed data in the DB. The size is configurable via CLI `max-database-cache-size`.\r\n- Added a `DryRun` execution type that skips the coinbase `Mint` transaction. In the future, we can skip some non-actual steps too.\r\n- Updated the `PrometheusExtension` to not use the lock.\r\n- Removed usage of the tracing extension in the graph QL because we have `PrometheusExtension` to gather the statistic about requests. https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1152 removes the honeycomb, so I didn't duplicate it here.\r\n- Replaced the `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + `Semaphore` by `tokio_rayon::spawn_fifo`.\r\n- Replaced the concatenated `column_key` with the array for separate hash maps per column in the `MemoryStore` and `MemoryTransactionView`.\r\n- Replaced the `Vec<u8>` in the KV API by the `Arc<Vec<u8>>`, because in most cases, we use it only for deserialization, and the memory database can continue to store the type. It helps reduce the number of clones.\r\n- Used `BTreeMap` in the `MemoryStore`, because it allows to have a more optimized `iter_all` method. Without this change, a new e2e test fails with a timeout.\r\n- Dry run doesn't wait for relayer anymore.", "created_at": "2023-04-25T14:46:55Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-27T10:44:34Z", "closed_at":

We can put\r\nany hex-encoded transaction and dry run it on the network. It contains a\r\nsimple transfer transaction right now.\r\n\r\nThe change improves the `fuel-core snapshot` command to accept the\r\narguments, and you can either snap the whole state of the blockchain via\r\nthe `everyone` command, or the state only of the contract. In the\r\nfollow-up PRs we can snapping of the coins and messages too.\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n- Use a lru cache to store the uncompressed data in the DB. The size is\r\nconfigurable via CLI `max-database-cache-size`.\r\n- Added a `DryRun` execution type that skips the coinbase `Mint`\r\ntransaction. In the future, we can skip some non-actual steps too.\r\n- Updated the `PrometheusExtension` to not use the lock.\r\n- Removed usage of the tracing extension in the graph QL because we have\r\n`PrometheusExtension` to gather the statistic about requests.\r\nhttps://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1152 removes the honeycomb,\r\nso I didn't duplicate it here.\r\n- Replaced the `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + `Semaphore` by\r\n`tokio_rayon::spawn_fifo`.\r\n- Replaced the concatenated `column_key` with the array for separate\r\nhash maps per column in the `MemoryStore` and `MemoryTransactionView`.\r\n- Replaced the `Vec<u8>` in the KV API by the `Arc<Vec<u8>>`, because in\r\nmost cases, we use it only for deserialization, and the memory database\r\ncan continue to store the type. It helps reduce the number of clones.\r\n- Used `BTreeMap` in the `MemoryStore`, because it allows to have a more\r\noptimized `iter_all` method. Without this change, a new e2e test fails\r\nwith a timeout.\r\n- Dry run doesn't wait for relayer anymore."}, "active_lock_reason": null, "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": {"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "comments": 2, "review_comments": 5, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 7, "additions": 123316, "deletions": 740, "changed_files": 42}
