It is going through large API changes, making it not as ergonomic for basic cases, which has ticked off a number of people.  I kept it for now because its elsewhere in our dependency tree.\r\n\r\nByron already updated `prodash` to use the latest `parking_lot`\r\n\r\nRemaining duplicates\r\n- `hex` is blocked on `crypto-hash` which seems to no longer be maintained\r\n- `hashbrown` is blocked on `indexmap` (updated in master) and `imara-diff`\r\n- `humantime`, `env_logger`, `hermit-abi` are present from the optional `pretty_env_logger` dependency (why are we using optional deps? #6348)\r\n- `windows-sys` is held back by `schannel`, `tempfile`, and `mio`\r\n\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:start -->\r\n<!--\r\nNOTICE: Due to limited review capacity, the Cargo team is not accepting new\r\nfeatures or major changes at this time.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n* If this is your first contribution, read \"Cargo Contribution Guide\":\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/\r\n* Run `cargo fmt --all` to format your code changes.\r\n* Small commits and pull requests are always preferable and easy to review.\r\n* If your idea is large and needs feedback from the community, read how:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/process/#working-on-large-features\r\n* Cargo takes care of compatibility. Read our design principles:\r\n  https://doc.crates.io/contrib/design.html\r\n* When changing help text of cargo commands, follow the steps to generate docs:\r\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages\r\n* If your PR is not finished, set it as \"draft\" PR or add \"WIP\" in its title.\r\n* It's ok to use the CI resources to test your PR, but please don't abuse them.\r\n\r\n### What does this PR try to resolve?\r\n\r\nExplain the motivation behind this change.\r\nA clear overview along with an in-depth explanation are helpful.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Fixes #<issue number>` to associate this PR to an existing issue.\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nDemonstrate how you test this change and guide reviewers through your PR.\r\nWith a smooth review process, a pull request usually gets reviewed quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to write and run your tests, please read the guide:\r\nhttps://doc.crates.io/contrib/tests\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOther information you want to mention in this PR, such as prior arts,\r\nfuture extensions, an unresolved problem, or a TODO list.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n", "created_at": "2023-03-02T22:48:50Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-09T13:51:34Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-03T09:35:28Z", "merged_at": "2023-03-03T09:35:28Z", "merge_commit_sha": "7b443fbfbf302171bdea10f2721986c62f1a03ab", "assignee": {"login": "weihanglo", "id": 14314532, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE0NTMy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14314532?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo", "html_url": "https://github.com/weihanglo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "weihanglo", "id": 14314532, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE0NTMy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14314532?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo", "html_url": "https://github.com/weihanglo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 139457341, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0NTczNDE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/labels/A-git", "name": "A-git", "color": "fbca04", "default": false, "description": "Area: anything dealing with git"}, {"id": 1261897039, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjYxODk3MDM5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
