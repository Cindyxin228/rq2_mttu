Here I use Harfbuzz for both shaping and cross-platform. So instead of writing the same logic using platform-specific shaping engine which I am also unfamiliar with, I just need to write a simple wrapper around `harfbuzz-sys` in `hb_wrapper.rs`.\r\n\r\nNotice that I also enforce the use of `freetype` feature for `font-kit` as `font-kit` would use platform-specific rasterization library by default which would breaks the logic of `harfbuzz`.\r\n\r\nThe application works well in macOS. However, I haven't test it on Windows or Linux yet. I would give it a test on these platforms when I have time.\r\n\r\nJetBrains
