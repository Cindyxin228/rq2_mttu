It is <a href=\"https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#sharing-a-regex-across-threads-can-result-in-contention\">also noted in the crate\ndocumentation</a>.\nThe bug can appear when sharing a regex across multiple threads simultaneously,\nas might be the case when using a regex from a <code>OnceLock</code>, <code>lazy_static</code> or\nsimilar primitive. Usually high contention only results when using many threads\nto execute searches on small haystacks.</p>\n<p>One can avoid the contention problem entirely through one of two methods.\nThe first is to use lower level APIs from <code>regex-automata</code> that require passing\nstate explicitly, such as <a href=\"https://docs.rs/regex-automata/latest/regex_automata/meta/struct.Regex.html#method.search_with\"><code>meta::Regex::search_with</code></a>.\nThe second is to clone a regex and send it to other threads explicitly. This\nwill not use any additional memory usage compared to sharing the regex. The\nonly downside of this approach is that it may be less convenient, for example,\nit won't work with things like <code>OnceLock</code> or <code>lazy_static</code> or <code>once_cell</code>.</p>\n<p>With that said, as of this release, the contention performance problems have\nbeen greatly reduced. This was achieved by changing the free-list so that it\nwas sharded across threads, and that ensuring each sharded mutex occupies a\nsingle cache line to mitigate false sharing. So while contention may still\nimpact performance in some cases, it should be a lot better now.</p>\n<p>Because of the changes to how the free-list works, please report any issues you\nfind with this release. That not only includes search time regressions but also\nsignificant regressions in memory usage. Reporting improvements is also welcome\nas well! If possible, provide a reproduction.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/934\">#934</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/934\">rust-lang/regex#934</a>):\nFix a performance bug where high contention on a single regex led to massive\nslow downs.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/554469b8c1116322f3c0a054ceeb610224f8ac65\"><code>554469b</code></a> 1.9.5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/48e09a85e46d2b8cc379cd0b69cd98467639f7ff\"><code>48e09a8</code></a> deps: bump regex-automata to 0.3.8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/894dcbe11e45d08b23db24f877574e06f3a69a35\"><code>894dcbe</code></a> regex-automata-0.3.8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/135e11ba9c54b383072ae98043c31dfe1066886a\"><code>135e11b</code></a> changelog: 1.9.5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/f578d74ff42f3df408378ff52d3bdf4433423532\"><code>f578d74</code></a> automata: reduce regex contention somewhat</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/9a505a1804f8f89e3448a2a2c5c70573dc6362e5\"><code>9a505a1</code></a> deps: bump to memchr 2.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/15cdc64869ea5508d96a0e7667c44c7c459986a1\"><code>15cdc64</code></a> cli: remove use of deprecated API</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/329c6a32451434fc2f229ad8d3c934c70148ae45\"><code>329c6a3</code></a> ci: use dtolnay@master instead of <a href=\"https://github.com/v1\"><code>@\u200bv1</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/2637e11b9fb9f3dc8bbfc3cbc625fd454c091d04\"><code>2637e11</code></a> ci: remove stale comment</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.4...1.9.5\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=regex&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=1.9.4&new-version=1.9.5)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
