[Cargo doesn't use the workspace version for path dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11133), so we still have to specify the versions. This is also how it's done in [fuel-core](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/blob/master/Cargo.toml).\r\n\r\nThis is actually nice because it means we could in the future bump the versions of the
