It directly returns and does not require any subscription. The transaction hash is returned.\r\n    - `watch_extrinsic` and `watch_extrinsic_until`: Requires a subscription, if available, the block hash is returned.\r\n- Subscription functions (`watch_extrinsic`, `subscribe_events` , ..) now handle the channel creation themselves. Instead of giving the `Sender` as an input, the `Receiver` is returned in a `WsSubscriptionWrapper`. The subscription value retrieved via the `next()` function (previously with `value.recv()`). This allows more freedom for the RpcClient implementation, as no mspc channel is enforced.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc9a   Feature Changes:\r\n- `RuntimeBlock` is now taken from the Runtime itself instead of a generic function return type.\r\n- RpcClients now implement the function `with_default_url()` and allows external `unsubscription` by the client (via the `WsSubscriptionWrapper`).\r\n- The RpcClients now handles the deserialization, not the api_client.\r\n- Introduces `RpcParams` and the accompanying `rpc_params![..]` macro. This allows to introduce params handling according to the websockets expectation. \r\n- `json_req.rs` has been removed, as it's not necessary anymore: methods should only get called once per api function and the params are given separately. \r\n- `subscribe` (previously `start_subscriber`) now expects an additional `unsub` method. This is not yet used, but it allows for better sub / unsub handling in case a more elaborate ws-client is implemented (like jsonrpsee)\r\n- `XtStatus` is now only used as input value. Return value is the substrate equivalent `TransactionStatus`, which can be deserialized directly from the rpc response.\r\n- Heavily cleaned up unnecessary function of the `WsRpcClient` and `TungsteniteClient`\r\n\r\nAnd some other minor corrections..\r\n\r\ncloses #175 ", "created_at": "2022-12-05T15:21:56Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-08T14:26:48Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-08T14:26:45Z",
