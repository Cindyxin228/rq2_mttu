Improved metrics gathering.\r\n- Stabilization and better test coverage of the `fuel-vm`. We removed almost all unsafe code and added test cases for each opcode. Fixed some edge cases with memory in the `fuel-vm`.\r\n- Fully integrated Merkle trees and filled all malleable fields in the transactions.\r\n- Added retryable messages, removed redundant fields from it, and updated the API to support a new commitment schema.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Breaking\r\n\r\n- All unsafe functions were replaced with safe analog in the `fuel-crypto` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/346\r\n- `$hp` holds the address of the last available byte in a heap, while previously it was `$hp - 1` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/377\r\n- Each variant in the `fuel_tx::Input` enum now has its own type - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/364\r\n- Message nonce is unified and now `Bytes32` everywhere - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/394\r\n- Removed the `message_id` field from all places - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/397, https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/373, \r\n- Unified the block height in all places with the introduction of a new `BlockHeigh` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/410\r\n- Make SMO instruction take data ptr as an argument -  https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/404\r\n- Now the chain id affects the signature and predicate's owner and should be passed into the `sign` function - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/406\r\n- Updated the `produce_blocks` endpoint to accept the start time and the number of blocks. All new blocks will use the previous timestamp as a base - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1059\r\n- The `fuel-core` stores only unspent coins and messages, so all API that previously returned spent coins is affected - Prune owned coin idx when inputs are spent by @Voxelot in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1055\r\n- The message proof API has been changed to be compatible with a new version - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1071\r\n- The `fuel-core` now has retryable messages and coin messages. Retryable messages can only be consumed during successful transaction execution. The coin message acts as common coins. `resouces_to_spend` API was replaced with `coins_to_spend` that returns a new `CoinType` type. - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1067\r\n\r\n## All
