Calls to it are made from the Go host env.\r\n\nIn situations where these system functions are not available, placeholders for it have to be injected into the runtime by the host.\n\r\nIn the Go code, injecting such a function would look similar to: \r\nhttps://github.com/1Password/onepassword-sdk-go/blob/main/internal/imported.go#L31-L38\r\n\r\n## Thought process\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by allowing the host environment to inject its own implementation for the `now` function. It requires the environment to export a `unix_time_milliseconds_imported`, returning the unix timestamp in milliseconds.\r\n\r\nThis change is fully backwards compatible, and it requires that the consumers of the crate explicitly opt in to provide this custom implementation by activating the `custom_wasm_env` feature. In the absence of this feature, calls to zxcvbn would panic.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\nCode review, to begin with, would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFor functional review, I have put together a test repository where the new behaviour can be validated.\r\n\r\nSee testing notes in the README: https://github.com/hculea/zxcvbn-test\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nIn the scope of this PR, I have also:\r\n* removed the `getrandom` dependency from the wasm32 dependency tree, as it was not being used anywhere\r\n* removed the `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` linter, as injecting a custom function requires the execution of unsafe code\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2024-06-03T12:38:12Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T09:38:42Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-05T14:54:50Z", "merged_at":
