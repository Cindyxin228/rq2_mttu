It sets an msrv of 1.65.0 and pins the 2021 edition. If the msrv or edition are a problem for your project: just stick with the 0.4.4 release.\n\nThe repository has moved from [@&#8203;alexcrichton](https://redirect.github.com/alexcrichton) to [@&#8203;trifectatechfoundation](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation), which takes on its maintainership from this point forward.\n\nThe main new feature of this release is the `libbz2-rs-sys` feature flag, which uses the pure rust https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/libbzip2-rs implementation of bzip2. Being all rust, and using (by default) the rust allocator infrastructure, cross-compilation (e.g. to webassembly) should be much easier.\n\nBesides that, the documentation was modernized (we can cross-link now) and several bugs were fixed.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   update `partial_io` to version `0.5.4` by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108)\n-   Remove tokio support by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/109](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/109)\n-   support `libbz2-rs-sys` by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/110](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/110)\n-   set msrv to 1.65.0 by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/111](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/111)\n-   set the edition to 2021 by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/112](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/112)\n-   fix clippy warnings by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/113](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/113)\n-   update documentation by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/114](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/114)\n-   Don't enable the stdio feature for the rust implementation of bzip2 by [@&#8203;bjorn3](https://redirect.github.com/bjorn3) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117)\n-   Fix infinite loop after invalid data by [@&#8203;jongiddy](https://redirect.github.com/jongiddy) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99)\n-   prepare release 0.5.0 by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/115](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/115)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108)\n-   [@&#8203;bjorn3](https://redirect.github.com/bjorn3) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117)\n-   [@&#8203;jongiddy](https://redirect.github.com/jongiddy) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/compare/0.4.4...v0.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Friday\" in timezone America/Chicago, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
