That is, `\\<` and `\\>`. The minimum supported Rust\nversion has also been raised to 1.65, which was released about one year ago.\n\nThe new word boundary assertions are:\n\n-   `\\<` or `\\b{start}`: a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the left,\n    `\\w` on the right).\n-   `\\>` or `\\b{end}`: a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\w` on the left, `\\W|\\z`\n    on the right)).\n-   `\\b{start-half}`: half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the\n    left).\n-   `\\b{end-half}`: half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\z` on the\n    right).\n\nThe `\\<` and `\\>` are GNU extensions to POSIX regexes. They have been added\nto the `regex` crate because they enjoy somewhat broad support in other regex\nengines as well (for example, vim). The `\\b{start}` and `\\b{end}` assertions\nare aliases for `\\<` and `\\>`, respectively.\n\nThe `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` assertions are not found in any\nother regex engine (although regex engines with general look-around support\ncan certainly express them). They were added principally to support the\nimplementation of word matching in grep programs, where one generally wants to\nbe a bit more flexible in what is considered a word boundary.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;469](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469):\n    Add support for `\\<` and `\\>` word boundary assertions.\n-   [FEATURE(regex-automata) #&#8203;1031](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1031):\n    DFAs now have a `start_state` method that doesn't use an `Input`.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1051](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1051):\n    Unicode character class operations have been optimized in `regex-syntax`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1090](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1090):\n    Make patterns containing lots of literal characters use less memory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1046](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1046):\n    Fix a bug that could result in incorrect match spans when using a Unicode word\n    boundary and searching non-ASCII strings.\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1047](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1047):\n    Fix panics that can occur in `Ast->Hir` translation (not reachable from `regex`\n    crate).\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1088](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1088):\n    Remove guarantees in the API that connect the `u` flag with a specific HIR\n    representation.\n\n`regex-automata` breaking change release:\n\nThis release includes a `regex-automata 0.4.0` breaking change release, which\nwas necessary in order to support the new word boundary assertions. For\nexample, the `Look` enum has new variants and the `LookSet` type now uses `u32`\ninstead of `u16` to represent a bitset of look-around assertions. These are\noverall very minor changes, and most users of `regex-automata` should be able\nto move to `0.4` from `0.3` without any changes at all.\n\n`regex-syntax` breaking change release:\n\nThis release also includes a `regex-syntax 0.8.0` breaking change release,\nwhich, like `regex-automata`, was necessary in order to support the new word\nboundary assertions. This release also includes some changes to the `Ast`\ntype to reduce heap usage in some cases. If you are using the `Ast` type\ndirectly, your code may require some minor modifications. Otherwise, users of\n`regex-syntax 0.7` should be able to migrate to `0.8` without any code changes.\n\n`regex-lite` release:\n\nThe `regex-lite 0.1.1` release contains support for the new word boundary\nassertions. There are no breaking changes.\n\n### [`v1.9.6`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#196-2023-09-30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.5...1.9.6)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a panic that can occur when the default\nregex size limit is increased to a large number.\n\n-   [BUG aa4e4c71](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/aa4e4c7120b0090ce0624e3c42a2ed06dd8b918a):\n    Fix a bug where computing the maximum haystack length for the bounded\n    backtracker could result underflow and thus provoke a panic later in a search\n    due to a broken invariant.\n\n### [`v1.9.5`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#195-2023-09-02)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.4...1.9.5)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that hopefully mostly fixes a performance bug that\noccurs when sharing a regex across multiple threads.\n\nIssue [#&#8203;934](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/934)\nexplains this in more detail. It is [also noted in the crate\ndocumentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#sharing-a-regex-across-threads-can-result-in-contention).\nThe bug can appear when sharing a regex across multiple threads simultaneously,\nas might be the case when using a regex from a `OnceLock`, `lazy_static` or\nsimilar primitive. Usually high contention only results when using many threads\nto execute searches on small haystacks.\n\nOne can avoid the contention problem entirely through one of two methods.\nThe first is to use lower level APIs from `regex-automata` that require passing\nstate explicitly, such as [`meta::Regex::search_with`](https://docs.rs/regex-automata/latest/regex_automata/meta/struct.Regex.html#method.search_with).\nThe second is to clone a regex and send it to other threads explicitly. This\nwill not use any additional memory usage compared to sharing the regex. The\nonly downside of this approach is that it may be less convenient, for example,\nit won't work with things like `OnceLock` or `lazy_static` or `once_cell`.\n\nWith that said, as of this release, the contention performance problems have\nbeen greatly reduced. This was achieved by changing the free-list so that it\nwas sharded across threads, and that ensuring each sharded mutex occupies a\nsingle cache line to mitigate false sharing. So while contention may still\nimpact performance in some cases, it should be a lot better now.\n\nBecause of the changes to how the free-list works, please report any issues you\nfind with this release. That not only includes search time regressions but also\nsignificant regressions in memory usage. Reporting improvements is also welcome\nas well! If possible, provide a reproduction.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;934](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/934):\n    Fix a performance bug where high contention on a single regex led to massive\n    slow downs.\n\n### [`v1.9.4`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#194-2023-08-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.3...1.9.4)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where `RegexSet::is_match(..)` could\nincorrectly return false (even when `RegexSet::matches(..).matched_any()`\nreturns true).\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1070](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1070):\n    Fix a bug where a prefilter was incorrectly configured for a `RegexSet`.\n\n### [`v1.9.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#193-2023-08-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.2...1.9.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where some searches could result in\nincorrect match offsets being reported. It is difficult to characterize the\ntypes of regexes susceptible to this bug. They generally involve patterns\nthat contain no prefix or suffix literals, but have an inner literal along with\na regex prefix that can conditionally match.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1060](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1060):\n    Fix a bug with the reverse inner literal optimization reporting incorrect match\n    offsets.\n\n### [`v1.9.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#192-2023-08-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.1...1.9.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes another memory usage regression. This\nparticular regression occurred only when using a `RegexSet`. In some cases,\nmuch more heap memory (by one or two orders of magnitude) was allocated than in\nversions prior to 1.9.0.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1059](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059):\n    Fix a memory usage regression when using a `RegexSet`.\n\n### [`v1.9.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#191-2023-07-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.9.0...1.9.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release which fixes a memory usage regression. In the regex\n1.9 release, one of the internal engines used a more aggressive allocation\nstrategy than what was done previously. This patch release reverts to the\nprior on-demand strategy.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1027](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027):\n    Change the allocation strategy for the backtracker to be less aggressive.\n\n### [`v1.9.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#190-2023-07-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.4...1.9.0)\n\n\\==================\nThis release marks the end of a [years long rewrite of the regex crate\ninternals](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656). Since this is\nsuch a big release, please report any issues or regressions you find. We would\nalso love to hear about improvements as well.\n\nIn addition to many internal improvements that should hopefully result in\n\"my regex searches are faster,\" there have also been a few API additions:\n\n-   A new `Captures::extract` method for quickly accessing the substrings\n    that match each capture group in a regex.\n-   A new inline flag, `R`, which enables CRLF mode. This makes `.` match any\n    Unicode scalar value except for `\\r` and `\\n`, and also makes `(?m:^)` and\n    `(?m:$)` match after and before both `\\r` and `\\n`, respectively, but never\n    between a `\\r` and `\\n`.\n-   `RegexBuilder::line_terminator` was added to further customize the line\n    terminator used by `(?m:^)` and `(?m:$)` to be any arbitrary byte.\n-   The `std` Cargo feature is now actually optional. That is, the `regex` crate\n    can be used without the standard library.\n-   Because `regex 1.9` may make binary size and compile times even worse, a\n    new experimental crate called `regex-lite` has been published. It prioritizes\n    binary size and compile times over functionality (like Unicode) and\n    performance. It shares no code with the `regex` crate.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;244](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/244):\n    One can opt into CRLF mode via the `R` flag.\n    e.g., `(?mR:$)` matches just before `\\r\\n`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;259](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/259):\n    Multi-pattern searches with offsets can be done with `regex-automata 0.3`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;476](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/476):\n    `std` is now an optional feature. `regex` may be used with only `alloc`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;644](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/644):\n    `RegexBuilder::line_terminator` configures how `(?m:^)` and `(?m:$)` behave.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;675](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/675):\n    Anchored search APIs are now available in `regex-automata 0.3`.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;824](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/824):\n    Add new `Captures::extract` method for easier capture group access.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;961](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/961):\n    Add `regex-lite` crate with smaller binary sizes and faster compile times.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;1022](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1022):\n    Add `TryFrom` implementations for the `Regex` type.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;68](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/68):\n    Added a one-pass DFA engine for faster capture group matching.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;510](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/510):\n    Inner literals are now used to accelerate searches, e.g., `\\w+@&#8203;\\w+` will scan\n    for `@`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;787](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/787),\n    [PERF #&#8203;891](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/891):\n    Makes literal optimizations apply to regexes of the form `\\b(foo|bar|quux)\\b`.\n\n(There are many more performance improvements as well, but not all of them have\nspecific issues devoted to them.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;429](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/429):\n    Fix matching bugs related to `\\B` and inconsistencies across internal engines.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;517](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/517):\n    Fix matching bug with capture groups.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;579](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/579):\n    Fix matching bug with word boundaries.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;779](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/779):\n    Fix bug where some regexes like `(re)+` were not equivalent to `(re)(re)*`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;850](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/850):\n    Fix matching bug inconsistency between NFA and DFA engines.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;921](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/921):\n    Fix matching bug where literal extraction got confused by `$`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;976](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/976):\n    Add documentation to replacement routines about dealing with fallibility.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1002](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1002):\n    Use corpus rejection in fuzz testing.\n\n### [`v1.8.4`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#184-2023-06-05)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.3...1.8.4)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where `(?-u:\\B)` was allowed in\nUnicode regexes, despite the fact that the current matching engines can report\nmatch offsets between the code units of a single UTF-8 encoded codepoint. That\nin turn means that match offsets that split a codepoint could be reported,\nwhich in turn results in panicking when one uses them to slice a `&str`.\n\nThis bug occurred in the transition to `regex 1.8` because the underlying\nsyntactical error that prevented this regex from compiling was intentionally\nremoved. That's because `(?-u:\\B)` will be permitted in Unicode regexes in\n`regex 1.9`, but the matching engines will guarantee to never report match\noffsets that split a codepoint. When the underlying syntactical error was\nremoved, no code was added to ensure that `(?-u:\\B)` didn't compile in the\n`regex 1.8` transition release. This release, `regex 1.8.4`, adds that code\nsuch that `Regex::new(r\"(?-u:\\B)\")` returns to the `regex <1.8` behavior of\nnot compiling. (A `bytes::Regex` can still of course compile it.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1006](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1006):\n    Fix a bug where `(?-u:\\B)` was allowed in Unicode regexes, and in turn could\n    lead to match offsets that split a codepoint in `&str`.\n\n### [`v1.8.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#183-2023-05-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.2...1.8.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where the regex would report a\nmatch at every position even when it shouldn't. This could occur in a very\nsmall subset of regexes, usually an alternation of simple literals that\nhave particular properties. (See the issue linked below for a more precise\ndescription.)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;999](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999):\n    Fix a bug where a match at every position is erroneously reported.\n\n### [`v1.8.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#182-2023-05-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.1...1.8.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where regex compilation could panic\nin debug mode for regexes with large counted repetitions. For example,\n`a{2147483516}{2147483416}{5}` resulted in an integer overflow that wrapped\nin release mode but panicking in debug mode. Despite the unintended wrapping\narithmetic in release mode, it didn't cause any other logical bugs since the\nerrant code was for new analysis that wasn't used yet.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;995](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/995):\n    Fix a bug where regex compilation with large counted repetitions could panic.\n\n### [`v1.8.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#181-2023-04-21)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.0...1.8.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a patch release that fixes a bug where a regex match could be reported\nwhere none was found.

Both of them will combined close over 40 existing issues and PRs.\n\nThis first release, despite its size, essentially represents preparatory work\nfor the second release, which will be even bigger. Namely, this release:\n\n-   Increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.0, which was released about 1 year ago.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `aho-corasick` to the recently released 1.0\n    version.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `regex-syntax` to the simultaneously released\n    `0.7` version. The changes to `regex-syntax` principally revolve around a\n    rewrite of its literal extraction code and a number of simplifications and\n    optimizations to its high-level intermediate representation (HIR).\n\nThe second release, which will follow ~shortly after the release above, will\ncontain a soup-to-nuts rewrite of every regex engine. This will be done by\nbringing [`regex-automata`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata) into\nthis repository, and then changing the `regex` crate to be nothing but an API\nshim layer on top of `regex-automata`'s API.\n\nThese tandem releases are the culmination of about 3\nyears of on-and-off work that [began in earnest in March\n2020](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656).\n\nBecause of the scale of changes involved in these releases, I would love to\nhear about your experience. Especially if you notice undocumented changes in\nbehavior or performance changes (positive *or* negative).\n\nMost changes in the first release are listed below. For more details, please\nsee the commit log, which reflects a linear and decently documented history\nof all changes.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;501](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/501):\n    Permit many more characters to be escaped, even if they have no significance.\n    More specifically, any ASCII character except for `[0-9A-Za-z<>]` can now be\n    escaped. Also, a new routine, `is_escapeable_character`, has been added to\n    `regex-syntax` to query whether a character is escapeable or not.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/547):\n    Add `Regex::captures_at`. This fills a hole in the API, but doesn't otherwise\n    introduce any new expressive power.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;595](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/595):\n    Capture group names are now Unicode-aware. They can now begin with either a `_`\n    or any \"alphabetic\" codepoint. After the first codepoint, subsequent codepoints\n    can be any sequence of alpha-numeric codepoints, along with `_`, `.`, `[` and\n    `]`. Note that replacement syntax has not changed.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/810):\n    Add `Match::is_empty` and `Match::len` APIs.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/905):\n    Add an `impl Default for RegexSet`, with the default being the empty set.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;908](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/908):\n    A new method, `Regex::static_captures_len`, has been added which returns the\n    number of capture groups in the pattern if and only if every possible match\n    always contains the same number of matching groups.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;955](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/955):\n    Named captures can now be written as `(?<name>re)` in addition to\n    `(?P<name>re)`.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now supports empty character classes.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has an optional `std` feature. (This will come\n    to `regex` in the second release.)\n-   FEATURE: The `Hir` type in `regex-syntax` has had a number of simplifications\n    made to it.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` has support for a new `R` flag for enabling CRLF\n    mode. This will be supported in `regex` proper in the second release.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has proper support for \"regex that never\n    matches\" via `Hir::fail()`.\n-   FEATURE: The `hir::literal` module of `regex-syntax` has been completely\n    re-worked. It now has more documentation, examples and advice.\n-   FEATURE: The `allow_invalid_utf8` option in `regex-syntax` has been renamed\n    to `utf8`, and the meaning of the boolean has been flipped.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   PERF: The upgrade to `aho-corasick 1.0` may improve performance in some\n    cases. It's difficult to characterize exactly which patterns this might impact,\n    but if there are a small number of longish (>= 4 bytes) prefix literals, then\n    it might be faster than before.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;514](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/514):\n    Improve `Debug` impl for `Match` so that it doesn't show the entire haystack.\n-   BUGS [#&#8203;516](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/516),\n    [#&#8203;731](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/731):\n    Fix a number of issues with printing `Hir` values as regex patterns.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;610](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/610):\n    Add explicit example of `foo|bar` in the regex syntax docs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;625](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/625):\n    Clarify that `SetMatches::len` does not (regretably) refer to the number of\n    matches in the set.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;660](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/660):\n    Clarify \"verbose mode\" in regex syntax documentation.\n-   BUG [#&#8203;738](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/738),\n    [#&#8203;950](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/950):\n    Fix `CaptureLocations::get` so that it never panics.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;747](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/747):\n    Clarify documentation for `Regex::shortest_match`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;835](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/835):\n    Fix `\\p{Sc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Currency_Symbol}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;846](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/846):\n    Add more clarifying documentation to the `CompiledTooBig` error variant.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;854](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/854):\n    Clarify that `regex::Regex` searches as if the haystack is a sequence of\n    Unicode scalar values.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;884](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/884):\n    Replace `__Nonexhaustive` variants with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;893](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/893):\n    Optimize case folding since it can get quite slow in some pathological cases.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;895](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/895):\n    Reject `(?-u:\\W)` in `regex::Regex` APIs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;942](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/942):\n    Add a missing `void` keyword to indicate \"no parameters\" in C API.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;965](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/965):\n    Fix `\\p{Lc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Cased_Letter}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;975](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/975):\n    Clarify documentation for `\\pX` syntax.\n\n### [`v1.7.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#173-2023-03-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.2...1.7.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small release that fixes a bug in `Regex::shortest_match_at` that\ncould cause it to panic, even when the offset given is valid.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;969](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/969):\n    Fix a bug in how the reverse DFA was called for `Regex::shortest_match_at`.\n\n### [`v1.7.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#172-2023-03-21)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.1...1.7.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small release that fixes a failing test on FreeBSD.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;967](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/967):\n    Fix \"no stack overflow\" test which can fail due to the small stack size.\n\n### [`v1.7.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#171-2023-01-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.7.0...1.7.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis release was done principally to try and fix the doc.rs rendering for the\nregex crate.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;930](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/930):\n    Optimize `replacen`.

This time,\nthe fix is for when the `pattern` feature is enabled, which only works on\nnightly Rust. CI has been updated to test this case.\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;772](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/772):\n    Fix build when `pattern` feature is enabled.\n\n### [`v1.5.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#153-2021-05-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.5.2...1.5.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis releases fixes a bug when building regex with only the `unicode-perl`\nfeature.

Rust 1.41 was chosen because it's still reasonably\nold, and is what's in Debian stable at the time of writing.\n\nThis release also drops this crate's own bespoke substring search algorithms\nin favor of a new\n[`memmem` implementation provided by the `memchr` crate](https://docs.rs/memchr/2.4.0/memchr/memmem/index.html).\nThis will change the performance profile of some regexes, sometimes getting a\nlittle worse, and hopefully more frequently, getting a lot better. Please\nreport any serious performance regressions if you find them.\n\n### [`v1.4.6`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#146-2021-04-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.4.5...1.4.6)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small patch release that fixes the compiler's size check on how much\nheap memory a regex uses. Previously, the compiler did not account for the\nheap usage of Unicode character classes. Now it does. It's possible that this\nmay make some regexes fail to compile that previously did compile. If that\nhappens, please file an issue.\n\n-   [BUG OSS-fuzz#33579](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=33579):\n    Some regexes can use more heap memory than one would expect.\n\n### [`v1.4.5`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#145-2021-03-14)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.4.4...1.4.5)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small patch release that fixes a regression in the size of a `Regex`\nin the 1.4.4 release. Prior to 1.4.4, a `Regex` was 552 bytes. In the 1.4.4\nrelease, it was 856 bytes due to internal changes. In this release, a `Regex`\nis now 16 bytes. In general, the size of a `Regex` was never something that was\non my radar, but this increased size in the 1.4.4 release seems to have crossed\na threshold and resulted in stack overflows in some programs.\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;750](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/750):\n    Fixes stack overflows seemingly caused by a large `Regex` size by decreasing\n    its size.\n\n### [`v1.4.4`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#144-2021-03-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.4.3...1.4.4)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small patch release that contains some bug fixes. Notably, it also\ndrops the `thread_local` (and `lazy_static`, via transitivity) dependencies.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;362](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/362):\n    Memory leaks caused by an internal caching strategy should now be fixed.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;576](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/576):\n    All regex types now implement `UnwindSafe` and `RefUnwindSafe`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;728](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/749):\n    Add missing `Replacer` impls for `Vec<u8>`, `String`, `Cow`, etc.\n\n### [`v1.4.3`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#143-2021-01-08)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.4.2...1.4.3)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small patch release that adds some missing standard trait\nimplementations for some types in the public API.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;734](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/734):\n    Add `FusedIterator` and `ExactSizeIterator` impls to iterator types.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;735](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/735):\n    Add missing `Debug` impls to public API types.\n\n### [`v1.4.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#142-2020-11-01)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.4.1...1.4.2)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small bug fix release that bans `\\P{any}`. We previously banned empty\nclasses like `[^\\w\\W]`, but missed the `\\P{any}` case. In the future, we hope\nto permit empty classes.\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;722](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/722):\n    Ban `\\P{any}` to avoid a panic in the regex compiler. Found by OSS-Fuzz.\n\n### [`v1.4.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#141-2020-10-13)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis is a small bug fix release that makes `\\p{cf}` work. Previously, it would\nreport \"property not found\" even though `cf` is a valid abbreviation for the\n`Format` general category.\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;719](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/719):\n    Fixes bug that prevented `\\p{cf}` from working.\n\n### [`v1.4.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#140-2020-10-11)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.3.9...1.4.0)\n\n\\==================\nThis releases has a few minor documentation fixes as well as some very minor\nAPI additions. The MSRV remains at Rust 1.28 for now, but this is intended to\nincrease to at least Rust 1.41.1 soon.\n\nThis release also adds support for OSS-Fuzz.

When all such features are\ndisabled, the dependency tree for `regex` shrinks to exactly 1 crate\n(`regex-syntax`). More information about the new crate features can be\n[found in the docs](https://docs.rs/regex/\\*/#crate-features).\n\nNote that while this is a new minor version release, the minimum supported\nRust version for this crate remains at `1.28.0`.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;474](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/474):\n    The `use_std` feature has been deprecated in favor of the `std` feature.\n    The `use_std` feature will be removed in regex 2. Until then, `use_std` will\n    remain as an alias for the `std` feature.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;583](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/583):\n    Add a substantial number of crate features shrinking `regex`.\n\n### [`v1.2.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#121-2019-08-03)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1)\n\n\\==================\nThis release does a bit of house cleaning. Namely:\n\n-   This repository is now using rustfmt.\n-   License headers have been removed from all files, in following suit with the\n    Rust project.\n-   Teddy has been removed from the `regex` crate, and is now part of the\n    `aho-corasick` crate.\n    [See `aho-corasick`'s new `packed` sub-module for details](https://docs.rs/aho-corasick/0.7.6/aho_corasick/packed/index.html).\n-   The `utf8-ranges` crate has been deprecated, with its functionality moving\n    into the\n    [`utf8` sub-module of `regex-syntax`](https://docs.rs/regex-syntax/0.6.11/regex_syntax/utf8/index.html).\n-   The `ucd-util` dependency has been dropped, in favor of implementing what\n    little we need inside of `regex-syntax` itself.\n\nIn general, this is part of an ongoing (long term) effort to make optimizations\nin the regex engine easier to reason about. The current code is too convoluted\nand thus it is very easy to introduce new bugs. This simplification effort is\nthe primary motivation behind re-working the `aho-corasick` crate to not only\nbundle algorithms like Teddy, but to also provide regex-like match semantics\nautomatically.\n\nMoving forward, the plan is to join up with the `bstr` and `regex-automata`\ncrates, with the former providing more sophisticated substring search\nalgorithms (thereby deleting existing code in `regex`) and the latter providing\nahead-of-time compiled DFAs for cases where they are inexpensive to compute.\n\n### [`v1.2.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#120-2019-07-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.1.9...1.2.0)\n\n\\==================\nThis release updates regex's minimum supported Rust version to 1.28, which was\nrelease almost 1 year ago.
