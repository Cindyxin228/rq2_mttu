My [tokio PR adding a biased; mode to join/try_join](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7307) landed. This allows us to skip the bookkeeping of keeping track of which branch of a `join`/`try_join!` statement was polled last, and always just poll in order.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor optimization for our graceful shutdown handler, since we always want to just poll our graceful shutdown future first before our non-op extension. So we can save a bit of memory on the stack by skipping storing a usize. It also very marginally could impact latency (by micros if not nanos, it's insignificant probably).\r\n\r\nAlso applying a similar optimization to the internal extension example where we have it the extension wait until after the main handler completes so that it can flush telemetry.\r\n\r\nThis involved explicitly setting `tokio` to `1.46`. This won't impact our MSRV as our MSRV is set to 1.81 but tokio is 1.70.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I
