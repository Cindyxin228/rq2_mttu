It only works because container runtimes\r\nwill auto-create parent directories.\r\n\r\nBut we clearly want to reflect the intended uid/gid/mode in the\r\ntar stream too, and we definitely want empty toplevel dirs like\r\n`/tmp`.\r\n\r\nThe simple fix of emitting them in our current flow actually fails\r\nwhen trying to import into `containers/storage`, complaining about\r\nduplicate entries.\r\n\r\nAnd this is because the simple fix ends up writing a `sysroot` entry\r\nwith two different modes (0755 and 0700).  One or the other needs\r\nto win, let's just have it be 0755 for now, though it doesn't really\r\nmatter for this.\r\n\r\nSo to really make this work, rework the flow so that the tar stream\r\nlooks like:\r\n\r\n- root directory\r\n- sysroot/ base structure\r\n- commit object\r\n- commit metadata\r\n- contents of root recursively *except* sysroot\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n", "created_at":
