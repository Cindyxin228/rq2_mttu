This was fine for a while but after upgrading to `rmp-serde` version `1.1.1`, it has broken. After giving it some thought I've realized that our implementation is outright wrong because we're assuming `Vec<u8>` and `&[u8]` serialize the same. A lot of the time this is true, but it won't always be, so we should stop making that assumption.\r\n\r\nThis PR does just that and instead makes it so we just use `Vec<u8>`'s serialize and deserialize implementations. It's easy to implement a `Visitor` and continue to use `serialize_bytes` but that ends up being a lot of code that we don't need to have. The cost to the database does not exist (I checked) so there's no downside.\r\n\r\nI've also included a new and upgraded database so that nobody else has to go through the process of updating. This comes with a few snapshot changes but nothing surprising (I am horrified to learn we weren't tracking things like `ChildData` though).", "created_at": "2023-05-27T07:12:18Z", "updated_at":
