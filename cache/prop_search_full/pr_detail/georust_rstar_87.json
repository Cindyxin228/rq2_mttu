I made changes to `src/algorithm/nearest_neighbor.rs` to fix the compile, and this resolved the compile failure. The tests now seem to pass.\r\n  \r\n- Updates the CI workflows file to test versions as far back as Rust 1.51 (but not Rust 1.50), as well as two more recent MSRVs.\r\n\r\n- Updates the `rstar/Cargo.toml` file to specify a `rust-version` key to indicate that Rust 1.51 is the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV). This will display a warning on versions of cargo older than that which was distributed with Rust 1.56, as the `rust-version` key was added in that release.", "created_at": "2022-03-20T16:47:32Z",
