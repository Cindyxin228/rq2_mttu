It is difficult to characterize the\ntypes of regexes susceptible to this bug. They generally involve patterns\nthat contain no prefix or suffix literals, but have an inner literal along with\na regex prefix that can conditionally match.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1060\">#1060</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1060\">rust-lang/regex#1060</a>):\nFix a bug with the reverse inner literal optimization reporting incorrect match\noffsets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.9.2 (2023-08-05)</h1>\n<p>This is a patch release that fixes another memory usage regression. This\nparticular regression occurred only when using a <code>RegexSet</code>. In some cases,\nmuch more heap memory (by one or two orders of magnitude) was allocated than in\nversions prior to 1.9.0.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059\">#1059</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059\">rust-lang/regex#1059</a>):\nFix a memory usage regression when using a <code>RegexSet</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.9.1 (2023-07-07)</h1>\n<p>This is a patch release which fixes a memory usage regression. In the regex\n1.9 release, one of the internal engines used a more aggressive allocation\nstrategy than what was done previously. This patch release reverts to the\nprior on-demand strategy.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027\">#1027</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027\">rust-lang/regex#1027</a>):\nChange the allocation strategy for the backtracker to be less aggressive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.9.0 (2023-07-05)</h1>\n<p>This release marks the end of a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656\">years long rewrite of the regex crate\ninternals</a>. Since this is\nsuch a big release, please report any issues or regressions you find. We would\nalso love to hear about improvements as well.</p>\n<p>In addition to many internal improvements that should hopefully result in\n&quot;my regex searches are faster,&quot; there have also been a few API additions:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
