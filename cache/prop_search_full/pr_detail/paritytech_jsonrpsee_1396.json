mainly impacts users that are using\r\nthe low-level API and rely on the `hyper::service::make_service_fn`\r\nwhich has been removed, and from now on you need to manage the socket yourself.\r\n\r\nThe `hyper::service::make_service_fn` can be replaced by the following example template:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nasync fn start_server() {\r\n  let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:0\").await.unwrap();\r\n\r\n  loop {\r\n    let sock = tokio::select! {\r\n    res = listener.accept() => {\r\n        match res {\r\n          Ok((stream, _remote_addr)) => stream,\r\n          Err(e) => {\r\n            tracing::error!(\"failed to accept v4 connection: {:?}\", e);\r\n            continue;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      _ = per_conn.stop_handle.clone().shutdown() => break,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let svc = tower::service_fn(move |req: hyper::Request<hyper::body::Incoming>| {\r\n      let mut jsonrpsee_svc = svc_builder\r\n        .set_rpc_middleware(rpc_middleware)\r\n        .build(methods, stop_handle);\r\n      // https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102211 the error type can't be inferred\r\n      // to be `Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>` so we need to convert it to a concrete type\r\n      // as workaround.\r\n      jsonrpsee_svc\r\n        .call(req)\r\n        .await\r\n        .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!(\"{:?}\", e))\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    tokio::spawn(jsonrpsee::server::serve_with_graceful_shutdown(\r\n      sock,\r\n      svc,\r\n      stop_handle.clone().shutdown(),\r\n    ));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that `tower::service_fn` and `hyper::service::service_fn` are different and it's recommended to use `tower::service_fn` from now.\r\n\r\n### Extensions\r\n\r\nBecause it was not possible/easy to share state between RPC middleware layers\r\njsonrpsee has added `Extensions` to the Request and Response.\r\nTo allow users to inject arbitrary data that can be accessed in the RPC middleware\r\nand RPC handlers.\r\n\r\nPlease be careful when injecting large amounts of data into the extensions because\r\nIt's cloned for each RPC call, which can increase memory usage significantly.\r\n\r\nThe connection ID from the jsonrpsee-server is injected in the extensions by default.\r\nand it is possible to fetch it as follows:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct LogConnectionId<S>(S);\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, S: RpcServiceT<'a>> RpcServiceT<'a> for LogConnectionId<S> {\r\n\ttype Future = S::Future;\r\n\r\n\tfn call(&self, request: jsonrpsee::types::Request<'a>) -> Self::Future {\r\n\t\tlet conn_id = request.extensions().get::<ConnectionId>().unwrap();\r\n\t\ttracing::info!(\"Connection ID {}\", conn_id.0);\r\n\r\n\t\tself.0.call(request)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition the `Extensions` is not added in the proc-macro API by default and\r\none has to enable `with_extensions` attr for that to be available:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[rpc(client, server)]\r\npub trait Rpc {\r\n\t// legacy\r\n\t#[method(name = \"foo\"])\r\n\tasync fn async_method(&self) -> u16>;\r\n\r\n\t// with extensions\r\n\t#[method(name = \"with_ext\", with_extensions)]\r\n\tasync fn f(&self) -> bool;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl RpcServer for () {\r\n\tasync fn async_method(&self) -> u16 {\r\n\t\t12\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// NOTE: ext is injected just after self in the API\r\n\tasync fn f(&self, ext: &Extensions: b: String) -> {\r\n\t\text.get::<u32>().is_ok()\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### client - TLS certificate store changed\r\n\r\nThe default TLS certificate store has been changed to\r\n`rustls-platform-verifier` to decide the best certificate\r\nstore for each platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition it's now possible to inject a custom certificate store\r\nif one wants need some special certificate store.\r\n\r\n### client - Subscription API modified\r\n\r\nThe subscription API has been modified:\r\n- The error type has been changed to `serde_json::Error`\r\n  to indicate that error can only occur if the decoding of T fails.\r\n- It has been some confusion when the subscription is closed which can occur if the client \"lagged\" or the connection is closed.\r\n  Now it's possible to call `Subscription::close_reason` after the subscription closed (i.e. has return None) to know why.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to replace old messages in case of lagging it is recommended to write your own adaptor on top of the subscription:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn drop_oldest_when_lagging<T: Clone + DeserializeOwned + Send + Sync + 'static>(\r\n    mut sub: Subscription<T>,\r\n    buffer_size: usize,\r\n) -> impl Stream<Item = Result<T, BroadcastStreamRecvError>> {\r\n    let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::broadcast::channel(buffer_size);\r\n\r\n    tokio::spawn(async move {\r\n        // Poll the subscription which ignores errors\r\n        while let Some(n) = sub.next().await {\r\n            let msg = match n {\r\n                Ok(msg) => msg,\r\n                Err(e) => {\r\n                    tracing::error!(\"Failed to decode the subscription message: {e}\");\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            // Only fails if the receiver has been dropped\r\n            if tx.send(msg).is_err() {\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    BroadcastStream::new(rx)\r\n}\r\n```", "created_at": "2024-06-06T16:00:17Z", "updated_at": "2024-06-07T07:55:30Z", "closed_at": "2024-06-07T07:55:30Z",
