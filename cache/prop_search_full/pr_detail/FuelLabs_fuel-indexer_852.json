`forc index deploy` where the `--path` isn't respected relative to the `--target-dir`\r\n\r\n### Testing steps \r\n- [ ] Build plugin locally `cargo build -p forc-index --release --locked`\r\n- [ ] Start fuel node `cargo run -p fuel-node --bin fuel-node`\r\n- [ ] Start the service `cargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --run-migrations`\r\n- [ ] `cd examples/block-explorer && forc-index deploy --path explorer-indexer --target-dir /path/to/fuel-indexer` \r\n  - This \u261d\ud83c\udffd would fail on master\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog \r\n- docs: update docs for examples \r\n- fix: ensure that
