The fix entails not dropping any value on error or panic, the method\n>   should only be used to read to types without `Drop` implementations.\n> \n> ### Version 0.21.2\n> \n> - Fixed a variety of crashes and opaque errors in webp\n> - Updated the png limits to be less restrictive\n> - Reworked even more `unsafe` operations into safe alternatives\n> - Derived Debug on FilterType and Deref on Pixel\n> - Removed a restriction on DXT to always require power of two dimensions\n> - Change the encoding of RGBA in bmp using bitfields\n> - Corrected various urls\n> \n> ### Version 0.21.1\n> \n> - A fairly important bugfix backport\n> - Fixed a potentially memory safety issue in the hdr and tiff decoders, see [#885](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/885)\n> - See [the full advisory](https://github.com/image-rs/image/blob/v0.21.3/docs/2019-04-23-memory-unsafety.md) for an analysis\n> - Fixes `ImageBuffer` index calculation for very, very large images\n> - Fix some crashes while parsing specific incomplete pnm images\n> - Added comprehensive fuzzing for the pam image types\n> \n> ### Version 0.21\n> \n> - Updated README to use `GenericImageView`\n> - Removed outdated version number from CHANGES\n> - Compiles now with wasm-unknown-emscripten target\n> - Restructured `ImageDecoder` trait\n> - Updated README with a more colorful example for the Julia fractal\n> - Use Rust 1.24.1 as minimum supported version\n> - Support for loading GIF frames one at a time with `animation::Frames`\n> - The TGA decoder now recognizes 32 bpp as RGBA(8)\n> - Fixed `to_bgra` document comment\n> - Added release test script\n> - Removed unsafe code blocks several places\n> - Fixed overlay overflow bug issues with documented proofs\n> \n> ### Version 0.20\n> \n> - Clippy lint pass\n> - Updated num-rational dependency\n> - Added BGRA and BGR color types\n> - Improved performance of image resizing\n> - Improved PBM decoding\n> - PNM P4 decoding now returns bits instead of bytes\n> - Fixed move of overlapping buffers in BMP decoder\n></tr></table> ...
