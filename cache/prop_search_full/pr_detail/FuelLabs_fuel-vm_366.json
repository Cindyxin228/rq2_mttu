The `fuel-vm` requires `InterpreterStorage` to implement those traits now, which can cause compilation errors.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fix panics in fuel-vm for exponent or bitshift larger than u32::MAX by @Dentosal in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/344\r\n* Do not allow setting reserved flags by @Dentosal in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/363\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**:
