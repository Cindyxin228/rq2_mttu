These are broken into separate PRs so that we can discuss each PR `HEAD` separately so that the PRs that can get merged, do so quickly. Otherwise, the further along they get stale the more work they all need in order to keep up to `master` without being hard to find which change introduced a possible broken build.\r\n\r\nThis PR only does a version bump to every crate dependency that does not need any code changes to apply cleanly.\r\n\r\nFollowing this PR will be a new PR, where every commit updates a single crate along with the files that were needed to be changed in order to work again. The crates that will need code changes are:\r\n\r\n- tokio 1.12: -> 1.40\r\n- rustc-hash: 1.1 -> 2.0\r\n- miden-core: 0.3 -> 0.10\r\n- notify: 5.0 -> 6.1\r\n- notify-debouncer-mini: 0.2 -> 0.4\r\n- revm: 2.3 -> 14.0\r\n- syn: 1.0 -> 2.0\r\n- tikv-jemallocator: 0.5 -> 0.6\r\n- toml_edit: 0.21 -> 0.22\r\n\r\nThere should also be a commit to upgrade Rust itself to >= `1.81.0`.\r\n\r\n... and for another day, there's 3 crates that will take a bit of time to get working, and so will go under a different issue #6536:\r\n\r\n- annotate-snippets\r\n- lsp-types\r\n- uint\r\n\r\n##
