This is a format typically used to profile golang programs.  It can be used to upload traces to [Google Cloud Profiler](https://cloud.google.com/profiler), and [Speedscope also supports it](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope/wiki/Importing-from-pprof-(go)).\r\n\r\nI've closely followed the approach used to add Speedscope support, so most of it should be fairly self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n~In the first commit, I've also done some refactoring in `Recorder::record()` to expand the API a bit without changing functionality.  This was helpful in implementing an additional `Recorder` trait for another project I'm working on.  If this change is undesirable, the `pprof`-related code should work the same without it.~ (See comment below)", "created_at": "2021-11-23T00:50:05Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-26T13:09:11Z", "closed_at":
