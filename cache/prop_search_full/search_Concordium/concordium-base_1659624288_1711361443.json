To be able to derive it for `PermitParam`, the `AccountSignature` type misses such feature. We need to implement these traits on the signature types in `contracts-common` first.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Derive `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` on signature types:

to lts-22.5 in stack.yaml files.\r\n- The package proto-lens-setup and its dependencies proto-lens-protoc and ghc-source-gen are not included in the LTS distribution, so specific versions from Hackage are pinned in the stack.yaml files.\r\n- TypeOperators is added to the default extensions. In future, this will be needed for using ~, and currently will generate a warning if not enabled.\r\n- Some imports are changed due to changes in library structure (notably, Control.Monad is explicitly imported, whereas it previously was implicitly imported through other monad modules).\r\n- Some code changes make types more explicit, e.g. in [type-changing record updates](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.6#type-changing-record-updates-involving-type-families).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] My code follows the style of this

found some inconveniences that this PR is trying to clean up.\r\n1. We don't want to encourage using the seed phrase directly when generating identity and credential requests. Therefore this code is removed from the wallet_library, and is instead only implemented in the web-sdk to ensure backwards compatiblity there. The Java SDK will only supply functions for using the keys directly.\r\n2. Removed the shared `common` types that no longer make any sense as there is now only a single input type and function. This in particular makes the types in the other SDK's nicer as they don't have to contain this `common` field only used for the JSON serialization.\r\n3. Tried to align the naming of types and functions in `identity.rs` a little.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Removed methods for generating identity object, identity recovery and credential deployment requests

Purpose\r\n\r\nThis PR adds generic adapters (as blanket implementation) to the ArkWorks interfaces. The adapters (with some additional configuration traits) are used to replace the BLS12-381 curve with ArkWorks implementation.  In addition to that, `ed25519-dalek` is upgraded to `v2.0`, which was previously blocked by the `pairing` crate and the corresponding BLS implementation (new versions don't expose the target group element type `Fp12`, preventing from serializing it, [see details here](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381/issues/96)). \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- implement `ArkGroup<G>` and `ArkField<F>` wrappers;\r\n- blanket implementations of the `Field` and `PrimeField` traits for `ArkField<F>`;\r\n- blanket implementation of  the `Curve` trait `ArkGroup<G>`;\r\n- all required trait implementations for the ArkWorks `BLS12-381` curve, that replaces the current BLS curve implementation from the `pairing` crate.\r\n- upgrade `ed25519-dalek` signature scheme; the `v2.0` API is a bit different, it bundles a secret and verifying (public) key into a signing key and maintains an invariant that the verifying key is always the public key of  secret_key; signing does not require passing the verifying key, so it was removed from parameters of the corresponding functions.\r\n- update FFI function types on the Haskell side to match the changes in the signing API (removed `verifing_key` parameter)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style of this project.\r\n- [x] The code compiles without warnings.\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of the changes.\r\n- [x] I

This corresponds to allowing for 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 word mnemonics. The current implementation allowed for any type of input, but assumed it was always 24 words. This change updates it so that it restricts the input as described by the standard, and also adds the missing tests to cover the test vectors for 12 and 18 words. There are no \"official\" test vectors for 15 and 21, and therefore a single test has been added to ensure that those work.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a breaking change to the interface, hence the major
