(re)genesis, but currently are specific to the old consensus. This introduces new core genesis parameters for the new consensus.\r\n\r\nThe genesis parameters for consensus version 0 are:\r\n- genesis time\r\n- slot duration\r\n- epoch length (in slots)\r\n- max block energy\r\n- finalization parameters\r\n\r\nThe genesis parameters for consensus version 1 are:\r\n- genesis time\r\n- epoch duration (in ms)\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this change, the `SeedState` (part of the block state), which currently includes the epoch length, must be versioned to remove the epoch length for the consensus version 1.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Introduce `CoreGenesisParametersV1` and `RegenesisDataV1` to replace `CoreGenesisParameters` and `RegenesisData` for the new consensus version. (BaseV1.hs)\r\n- Rename `GenesisParameters` to `GenesisParametersV2` and introduce `GenesisParametersV3`. Add `BaseV1.parametersToState` for generating the genesis state for the new consensus version from genesis parameters.\r\n- Tweak the genesis executable to support printing the new genesis version with the revised parameters.\r\n- Refactor `Conditionally` to its own module.\r\n- Parametrise `SeedState` by a new `SeedStateVersion`. `SeedStateVersion1` removes the `epochLength` that is present in `SeedStateVersion0`.\r\n- Lift `IsConsensusV0` and `IsConsensusV1` to `Parameters`. Constraints on the seed state version are added to both definitions. `ConsensusVersion` and `consensusVersionFor` provide a way to obtain the constraints for a particular protocol version.\r\n\r\n##

protocol. We also adopt the [singletons library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) and broadly use that where we have previously defined singletons directly.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/issues/638 together with\r\nhttps://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/pull/653 \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nChanges to the parameters:\r\n- Election difficulty is generalised to \"consensus parameters\". For <P6, this is just the election difficulty. For P6, this consists of:\r\n  - Timeout parameters: Timeout base time, timeout increase factor, timeout decrease factor.\r\n  - Minimum block time.\r\n  - Block energy limit.\r\n- The consensus parameters are updatable with the same keys as for the election difficulty:\r\n  - The access structure `asParamElectionDifficulty` is renamed to `asParamConsensusParameters`.\r\n  - For JSON serialization of the level 2 authorizations, `electionParameters` is still used. This is to maintain compatibility, and since the old GRPC API is deprecated.\r\n  - (It is renamed to `parameter_consensus` in the GRPC2 API. Renaming does not break binary compatibility.)\r\n  - Each of the three new consensus parameters is updatable independently, though with the same keys.\r\n- The GAS reward for including finalization proofs has been removed.\r\n\r\nTechnical changes:\r\n- Use the singletons library to construct the existing singletons for `ProtocolVersion`, `ChainParametersVersion`, `AccountVersion` and `TransactionOutcomesVersion`. Generally, the same interface is maintained, however:\r\n  - The constructors of `SChainParametersVersion` are renamed, e.g. `SCPV0` to `SChainParametersV0`.\r\n  - Where the `IsProtocolVersion` constraint is used, the module should use `{-# LANGUAGE MonoLocalBinds #-}` (or `TypeFamilies` or `GADTs`, which imply this) to avoid warnings.\r\n- `JustForCPV1` is removed. It is replaced with two new types:\r\n  - `Conditionally`, with constructors `CTrue` and `CFalse`, holds a value if the type-level boolean parameters is `True`.\r\n  - `OParam`, with constructors `SomeParam` and `NoParam`, holds a value if the chain parameters version supports the given parameter type.\r\n- A number of new versioning types that are dependent on `ChainParametersVersion` are introduced for fine-grained control of version specific parameters:\r\n  - `MintDistributionVersion`:\r\n    - `MintDistributionVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`): supports mint per slot.\r\n    - `MintDistributionVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`): does not support mint per slot.\r\n  - `GASRewardsVersion`:\r\n    - `GASRewardsVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`, `ChainParametersV1`): supports GAS reward for finalization proofs.\r\n    - `GASRewardsVersion1` (`ChainParametersV2`): does not support GAS reward for finalization proofs.\r\n  - `CooldownParametersVersion`:\r\n    - `CooldownParametersVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`): baker cooldown specified in epochs.\r\n    - `CooldownParametersVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`): baker and delegator cooldowns specified in seconds.\r\n  - `PoolParametersVersion`:\r\n    - `PoolParametersVersion0`: (`ChainParametersV0`): minimum stake for registering a baker.\r\n    - `PoolParametersVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`):\r\n      - passive commission rates\r\n      - bounds on pool commission rates\r\n      - minimum baker equity capital\r\n      - leverage bound for a baker\r\n  - `ConsensusParametersVersion`:\r\n    - `ConsensusParametersVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`, `ChainParametersV1`): election difficulty\r\n    - `ConsensusParametersVersion1` (`ChainParametersV2`):\r\n        - Timeout parameters\r\n        - Minimum block time\r\n        - Block energy limit\r\n  - `AuthorizationsVersion`:\r\n    - `AuthorizationsVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`).\r\n    -
