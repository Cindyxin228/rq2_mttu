boilerplate and producing more readable specs.\r\n\r\nThe tool is currently in a very early stage and does only one thing:\r\nfor each `aborts_if` in a function spec, test whether it is redundant.\r\nIt achieves this by removing the `aborts_if` and check whether the function spec can still be proved.\r\n\r\nMore functionalities will be added to the tool later, such as\r\n- spec unrolling\r\n- spec simplification\r\n\r\nTo run the tool:\r\n```bash\r\ncd language/move-prover/tools/spec-flatten\r\ncargo run -- ../../../diem-framework/core/sources/AccountCreationScripts.move -d ../../../diem-framework/core/sources -d ../../../move-stdlib/sources\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpect results like:\r\n```\r\nfun AccountCreationScripts::create_child_vasp_account\r\n  Number of aborts_if trimmed: 32 (out of 60)\r\nfun AccountCreationScripts::create_designated_dealer\r\n  Number of aborts_if trimmed: 18 (out of 43)\r\n......\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nExperimental tool on ideas

`executor-benchmark` after we use the same txn gen/exec/commit mods.\r\n\r\nNow it supports two subcommand to create a base db or run an executor benchmarking on an existing base db by creating a checkpoint db and keep the base db untouched (internally using hardlinks, a feature of rocksdb). So the same base db can be reused again and again, which is especially helpful to benchmarking on huge dataset because creating a huge db with real txns needs a long time.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n1. Move `diemdb-benchmark` into `executor-benchmark` as `db-generation` mod.\r\n2. Change `db-generation` code to store accounts info into a META file which can be read by executor bench to run. Otherwise it doesn't know what accounts exist in the existing db.\r\n3.

client API to the code.

For now, I've put the crate in the `state-sync` subfolder (to match the `storage-service`). But, we may wish to move it in the future. I don't feel super strongly here.\r\n- The API is not final or complete. What is offered here is a simple starting point to decouple the workstreams.

moving it out of the backup and restore code into a `verify()` method on the proof struct itself.

Updated definition of `ValidType` to include types defined solely in input type relations.\r\n2. Additions of missing transitive cases for `MemberTrans, TypedCaller, TypedDominates, TypedDataflow`.\r\n3. Modification of `TypedDataflowNotVia` to refine definitions for both of its cases.\r\n4. Added `NotCheckedTypeAt` to provide more feedback on where an unchecked dataflow terminates.\r\n\r\nChange 3 is the least straightforward. The gist of the change is that `TypedDataflowNotVia` has two cases:\r\n1. An unchecked non-transitive dataflow.\r\n2. A dataflow via some node that is not \"safe\" or \"covered\" by a checker.\r\n\r\nThe modification to the first case is simply a fix to ensure that the non-transitive dataflow is to a terminal node.\r\n\r\nThe modification to the second case refines the definition of a safe dataflow of type t between a node and a checker to cover two distinct cases:\r\n1. The node has a dataflow to the checker for type t.\r\n2. The checker dominates the node for type t.\r\n\r\nThe first case was previously included, the second case is added by this PR.\r\n\r\n### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/diem/diem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nThe existing Datalog tests have been updated with respect to the changed analysis definitions.\r\nThe tests pass.\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## If targeting a release branch, please fill the below out as well\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9236/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9236/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9234", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9234/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9234/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9234/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9234", "id": 1003564581, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCq3UYc4sGTJs", "number": 9234, "title": "[docker] add experimental move bytecode", "user": {"login": "sherry-x", "id": 55457892, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU3ODky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55457892?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x", "html_url": "https://github.com/sherry-x", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherry-x/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1724364070, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI0MzY0MDcw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/labels/cla-signed", "name": "cla-signed", "color": "4ece99", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-09-22T00:40:45Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-22T01:53:40Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-22T01:53:40Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/pulls/9234", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9234", "diff_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9234.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9234.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-22T01:53:40Z"}, "body": "<!--\r\nThank you for sending a PR.

Specifically, it stubs out the logic required for the remaining API calls (`get_transaction_outputs_with_proof()` and `get_account_states_chunk_with_proof()`) and adds support for fetching relevant metadata regarding these calls. With this PR, we now have a skeleton for the server side of the storage service that can be filled in to provide all the data we need for state sync v2.\r\n\r\nThe PR offers the following commits:\r\n1. Add a skeleton for the `get_transaction_outputs_with_proof()` API call. For now, the API call will return an error as we're waiting for `TransactionOutputs` to be supported by the DB.\r\n2. Add a skeleton for the `get_account_states_chunk_with_proof()` API call. This requires introducing a new type `AccountStatesChunkWithProof` that will be implemented/completed in a follow up PR.

The processor runs *after* global invariant instrumentation, so it sees all memory including that which is only used by injected invariants.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug unearthed during the development of specification variables. Namely, if a global invariant uses memory which is not used by the function in which it is injected, we missed to generate the right assumptions for this memory, because usage analysis happens before invariants are injected.

Additionally, cleans up some code and we are able to get rid of the `Arc<NetworkContext>` to just `NetworkContext`.\r\n\r\n## Migration Plan\r\n\r\n1. Deploy all validators and VFNs with this version (serializing to old format).\r\n2. Change code to output serialization to new format\r\n3.

The Storage Service is an inter-node service allowing Diem nodes to request storage data (e.g., transactions and proofs) directly from other nodes over the Diem network. This PR sets up the framework (template) for this service by implementing the plumbing between request/response processing from the server-side, as well as outlines the required interface between the server and local Diem DB. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the PR offers 2 commits:\r\n1. Add the new server implementation (as a library to later be exposed over the network)\r\n2. Add several (simple) tests for the server implementation. These will need to be improved and expanded in the future.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The implementation offered here is by no means complete (and you'll notice many TODOs). Instead, this PR is meant to set up the framework so that we can start building on the server-side implementation and make the Storage Service a living thing \ud83d\ude04\r\n\r\n### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/diem/diem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nA set of simple unit tests have been added for this functionality.\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\n\r\nNone, but this PR relates to: https://github.com/diem/diem/issues/8906", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9199/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9199/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9198", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9198/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9198/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9198/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9198", "id": 998422861, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCq3UYc4r2RPw", "number": 9198, "title": "[diem node] add option to specify genesis modules for testing", "user": {"login": "emmazzz", "id": 14351986, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxOTg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351986?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz", "html_url": "https://github.com/emmazzz", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmazzz/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1724364070, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI0MzY0MDcw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/labels/cla-signed", "name": "cla-signed", "color": "4ece99", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2021-09-16T16:49:25Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-17T05:27:49Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-17T05:27:49Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/pulls/9198", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9198", "diff_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9198.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9198.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-17T05:27:49Z"}, "body": "<!--\r\nThank you for sending a PR.

recently added `EventSubscriptionService` (see [here](https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9117)). The benefits of this change include: (i) better encapsulation between the service and subscribers, e.g., we don't leak so many implementation details; (ii) reconfiguration subscribers are now automatically subscribed to all configs, simplifying the code -- note there was a bug with mempool in regards to this, i.e., it was expecting to listen to something that it never subscribed to (!); (iii) subscribers can actively now listen to events; and (iv) all of the messy code is now simplified and located in one place \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the PR offers 5 commits:\r\n1. Update mempool to listen to the `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n2. Update consensus to listen to the `EventSubscriptionService`. \r\n3. Update network to listen to the `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n4. Update state sync to drive the `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n5. Remove the old `SubscriptionService`.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I'm not proud of how I managed to hook up the network builder (i.e., in commit 3), but it seems to be okay. The network folks might want to re-think this in the future.\r\n\r\n### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/diem/diem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nExisting unit and integration tests should cover this change.\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\n\r\nNone, but this PR relates to: https://github.com/diem/diem/issues/8906", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9164/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9164/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9163", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9163/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9163/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9163/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9163", "id": 995465192, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCq3UYc4rtBH6", "number": 9163, "title": "[State Sync] Use the claim crate for better test assertions", "user": {"login": "JoshLind", "id": 4578587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Nzg1ODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4578587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind", "html_url": "https://github.com/JoshLind", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1724364070, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI0MzY0MDcw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/labels/cla-signed", "name": "cla-signed", "color": "4ece99", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-09-14T00:38:47Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-14T04:09:27Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-14T04:06:08Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/pulls/9163", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9163", "diff_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9163.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9163.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-14T04:06:08Z"}, "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR updates all state sync code to utilize the [claim](https://crates.io/crates/claim) crate for better assertion support. While I'm generally reluctant of adding new crate dependencies to code, the claim crate provides much nicer error messages on assertion failures and avoids situations where assertion failures produce unhelpful outputs (e.g., see here: https://github.com/diem/diem/issues/9062). Instead, using claim, we now get error messages like:\r\n\r\nFailure on `assert_matches!`:\r\n```\r\nthread 'coordinator::tests::test_new_and_lost_peers' panicked at 'assertion failed, expression does not match any of the given variants.\r\n    expression: Ok(())\r\n    variants: Err(Error::InvalidStateSyncPeer(..))', state-sync/state-sync-v1/src/coordinator.rs:1978:9\r\n```\r\n\r\nFailure on `assert_ok!`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'tests::test_missing_configs' panicked at 'assertion failed, expected Ok(..), got Err(CannotSubscribeToZeroEventKeys)', state-sync/inter-component/event-notifications/src/tests.rs:398:5\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, using the crate has: (i) made the tests more readable (i.e., it allows the reader to better distinguish between general unwraps/expects and the assertions the test cares about); and (ii) reduced the lines of code (e.g., due to having native support for things like `assert_matches`). Finally, we note that this dependency is test-only.\r\n\r\nThe PR offers the following commits:\r\n1. Adopt claim for consensus notifications\r\n2. Adopt claim for mempool notifications\r\n3. Adopt claim for state sync\r\n4. Adopt claim for event notifications\r\n\r\nNote: this is a follow-up to: https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9124 (after a recommendation by @zekun000 \ud83d\ude04).\r\n\r\n### Have you read the

initializer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec module {\r\n   global spec_var: num = 1; // optional initializer\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn update of a spec var can appear in a function spec block:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun f()

\"ghost\" memory. That is for each `global x: T`, there is a generated `struct Ghost$x has key { v: T }`. Access to spec vars is right-away mapped to accessing this memory (at address `@0`) in move-model. This way, memory usage and global invariant analysis can be applied to spec vars uniformly.\r\n\r\nFor a number of examples, see the test [global_vars.move](https://github.com/wrwg/diem/blob/spec_var/language/move-prover/tests/sources/functional/global_vars.move).\r\n\r\nThis implementation isn't complete yet; there is some more work to do with opaque functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nMore expressive spec lang\r\n\r\n### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/diem/diem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nNew tests\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\n\r\nNA", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9154/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9154/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9152", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9152/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9152/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/issues/9152/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9152", "id": 994309099, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzMyMjcwNzIy", "number": 9152, "title": "[State Sync] Update the EventSubscriptionService to handle missing on-chain configs.", "user": {"login": "JoshLind", "id": 4578587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Nzg1ODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4578587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind", "html_url": "https://github.com/JoshLind", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshLind/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1724364070, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI0MzY0MDcw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/labels/cla-signed", "name": "cla-signed", "color": "4ece99", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2021-09-12T23:13:01Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-14T00:03:56Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-14T00:03:55Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/diem/diem/pulls/9152", "html_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9152", "diff_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9152.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9152.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-14T00:03:56Z"}, "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere was recently a bug uncovered in some of our legacy code where state sync will panic if it's unable to fetch the value of a config on-chain (see here: https://github.com/diem/diem/issues/9121). This PR applies the same fix (https://github.com/diem/diem/pull/9130) to the newly added `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n\r\nThe PR offers two commits:\r\n1. Apply the fix and a new unit test to the `EventSubscriptionService` to cover the error case.\r\n2.
