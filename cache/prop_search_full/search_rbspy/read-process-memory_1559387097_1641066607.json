have to add a `Drop` impl for the windows `ProcessHandle`. This also means that we need to remove the `Copy` and `Clone` impls for that struct to avoid closing the handle while a copy is still held.\r\n\r\nIt seems unfortunate to have all the other platforms impl copy/clone for the handle and for windows to have neither. I think the best middle ground would be to remove `Copy` across the board, and then make the windows `ProcessHandle` use an `Arc` internally so it can still impl `Clone`, but if we're fine with the asymmetry between platforms we can leave it as is.\r\n\r\nI also took the liberty of updating the edition from 2015 to 2021, running rustfmt, and updating the dependencies. `winapi` has subsumed the old `kernel32` crate, so I removed the latter. If these cleanup changes aren't wanted I can revert them and just include the bug fix.\r\n\r\nFixes #14", "reactions": {"url":
