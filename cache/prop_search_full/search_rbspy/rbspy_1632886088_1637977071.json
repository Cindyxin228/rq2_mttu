This is a format typically used to profile golang programs.  It can be used to upload traces to [Google Cloud Profiler](https://cloud.google.com/profiler), and [Speedscope also supports it](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope/wiki/Importing-from-pprof-(go)).\r\n\r\nI've closely followed the approach used to add Speedscope support, so most of it should be fairly self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n~In the first commit, I've also done some refactoring in `Recorder::record()` to expand the API a bit without changing functionality.  This was helpful in implementing an additional `Recorder` trait for another project I'm working on.  If this change is undesirable, the `pprof`-related code should work the same without it.~ (See comment below)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/344/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/344/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/342", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/342/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/342/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/342/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/pull/342", "id": 1047677127, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA38EDc4uPQLL", "number": 342, "title": ".gitignore: flamegraph.svg, rbspy-out.svg, rbspy-raw.txt", "user": {"login": "Horki", "id": 1398263, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTgyNjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1398263?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki", "html_url": "https://github.com/Horki", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Horki/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-11-08T16:49:14Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-09T02:34:19Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-09T02:34:19Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/pulls/342", "html_url": "https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/pull/342", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/pull/342.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/pull/342.patch", "merged_at": "2021-11-09T02:34:19Z"}, "body": "Hi @acj add 'examples' generated file into .gitignore", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/342/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/342/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
