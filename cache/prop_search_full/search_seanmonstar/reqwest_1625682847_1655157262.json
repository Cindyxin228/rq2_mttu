improves the user experience of the users leveraging rustls.\n\nWhen building the identity to use for requests, it's now possible to use also private keys using Elliptic Curve that are encoded with SEC1 standard.\n\nThis is the default encoding used by openssl when EC keys are created. Prior to this commit users had to convert those keys from the SEC1 encoding to the PKCS 8 one, which is something not trivial.\n\nThis feature has been recently added to rustls-pemfile crate. This commit update the `rustls-pemfile` crate to its latest stable release.\n\nI also had to change a little the code used to extract the private keys from the PEM file. That's because `rustls-pemfile` doens't provide a high level API that extracts Elliptic Curve keys.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1526/reactions",

`Error`.\r\n\r\nPrivate formatting methods for kind (`write_kind`) and source (`write_source`) are added for consistency across formats, as well as `write_url_plain` and `write_url_masked` for different URL displays.\r\n\r\nFinally, a test was added to make sure the formatters work as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSee also, #1299 for prior implementation of some of these\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: The `set_url`/`clear_url` and `with_url`/`without_url` pairs are a bit redundant, though the ergonomics are different.

attempt to fix the conflicting conversion code requried to turn a `Body` into a `JsValue` depending if the body is standalone or if it is part of a form (aka multipart/form-data).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to introduce a new variant to the `crate::wasm::body::Inner` enum that holds the actual content of a body. The new variant allows `Body.to_js_value` to have dedicated codepaths for standalone bodies and form parts. The new variant is contructed by the new `Body.into_part` method. That method is called by the `crate::wasm::multipart::Part::new` constructor and turns an Inner::Body into the new Inner::MultipartPart variant.\r\n\r\nThe drawback is that the new variant leads to some code duplication in the `Body` methods where it mostly shares code with the `Inner::Bytes` variant.\r\n\r\nFor clarity the PR renames the `Inner::Multipart` variant to `Inner::MultipartForm`. It also adds new test cases to cover the serialization of different bodies either standalone or multipart.\r\n\r\nThanks to @crapStone for pointing at the `Inner` enum in #1358 and @skystar-p for the original mutlipart conversion code in #1341.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1364/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

The context is I had some code that relied on using TLS client certificate/keys and was occasionally running into issues where it would throw the \"private key or certificate not found\" error.\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation, I found that, at least in one reproducible case, the client key was in the standard ECSDA PEM format:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\r\ncontents\r\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, the two calls to `pkcs8_keys` and `rsa_private_keys` [shown here](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/master/src/tls.rs#L215) were both returning an empty vec. At face value, it's not obvious that this is going on under the hood and was confusing since I know that `rustls` supports these types of keys. The solution, in my case, was to simply convert the key to the PKCS#8 format in order to conform to what the crate was expecting. It's also worth noting that I was using `curl` as my sanity check which does support this key format out of the box - so there's even more chance of someone getting confused in this case. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution is changing the error message to indicate this possibility - but I thought starting with the documentation was a cleaner approach (it would have saved me about an hour). \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1335/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334", "id": 1004948964, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA7dkLM4sKtum", "number": 1334, "title": "Allow to clone a Identity", "user": {"login": "silvioprog", "id": 1456829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTY4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1456829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog", "html_url": "https://github.com/silvioprog", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-09-23T02:32:55Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-29T20:06:17Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-29T20:02:04Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/pulls/1334", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334", "diff_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-29T20:02:04Z"}, "body": "For example, it can be useful when we need to store an Identity in a hash map.

The biggest issue is that whitespace between entries should be ignored/trimmed, but is not (i.e. \"`NO_PROXY='a, b'`\" would never match \"`b`\"). In addition, according to cURL's rules, a `NO_PROXY` entry without a leading dot should match the domain itself as well as any subdomains (reqwest only handles exact matches if there is no leading dot) and entries _with_ a leading dot should _only_ match subdomains (but request allows exact matches). Finally, cURL allows a special entry \"`*`\" to match all entries (effectively disabling use of the proxy).\r\n\r\nAll changes in behavior have corresponding changes to the tests.\r\n\r\nI tried to

Ideas for an alternative signature / implementation would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI wanted to do `Response` conversion too, but that seems even more complex unfortunately \ud83d\ude41\r\n\r\nAlso it seems like the current `Response` conversion impl only exists in `async_impl`, not in `wasm`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1319/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1319/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1316", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1316/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1316/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1316/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1316", "id": 970534891, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzEyNDc0NzIx", "number": 1316, "title": "Log instead of error `MissingOrMalformedExtensions` in `rustls_native_certs::load_native_certs`", "user": {"login": "TjeuKayim", "id": 15987676, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTg3Njc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15987676?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim", "html_url": "https://github.com/TjeuKayim", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TjeuKayim/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2021-08-13T16:02:13Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-28T00:23:02Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-27T18:57:53Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/pulls/1316", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1316", "diff_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1316.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1316.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-27T18:57:53Z"}, "body": "Only log errors because rustls-native-certs doesn't work with certificates that don't define any extensions, this is caused by the webpki crate: https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/blob/17d9189981a618120fd8217a913828e7418e2484/src/error.rs#L78-L83\r\nHowever, such certs might be present in the trusted root store, like for Windows systems in an enterprise domain.
