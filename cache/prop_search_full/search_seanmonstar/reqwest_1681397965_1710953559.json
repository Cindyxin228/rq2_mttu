So for example, a client makes, say, 500 concurrent requests to an HTTP/2 server while the server's `max_concurrent_streams` is set to 100. In this case the client is allowed to initiate 500 concurrent streams _until_ the initial `SETTINGS` frame from the server reaches to the client, though the server will reject 400 streams by responding `REFUSED_STREAM`.\r\nFrom the standpoint of users of `reqwest` crate, I would expect the crate to deal with this kind of situation behind the scenes. Actually, as far as I searched, Go and libcurl provides the retry logic when they encounter `REFUSED_STREAM`. Considering the \"ergonomic, batteries-included\" characteristic of `reqwest`, I believe automatic retry would be very nice to have.\r\n\r\nHere's a repo containing reproducible code written in a couple different languages. It also has `rust-patched` code which demonstrates that this patch does fix the issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/magurotuna/deno-fetch-h2-stream-error-repro", "reactions": {"url":

This will enable a lot of interesting uses (such as a reverse proxy, example code attached in the end).\r\n\r\nBy interoperability with http I mean the following four components:\r\n\r\n- impl `TryFrom` from `http::Request<http::Body>` to `reqwest::Request` (already implemented prior to this PR)\r\n-  impl `TryFrom` from `reqwest::Response` to  `http::Response<reqwest::Body>`\r\n- impl `http::Body` for `reqwest::Body`\r\n- impl `tower::Service<reqwest::Request, Response=reqwest::Response, Error=reqwest::Error>` for `reqwest::Client`  (also already implemented prior to this PR)\r\n\r\nIn fact, all the implementation logic is already there. I only assembled these together.\r\n\r\nNow with all these trait implementations and conversion functions, it becomes easy to play with axum and other `http`-based frameworks. Here's an example reverse proxy written in axum:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse axum::Router;\r\nuse tower::{Layer, ServiceExt};\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main(flavor = \"current_thread\")]\r\nasync fn main() {\r\n  let client = reqwest::Client::new();\r\n  let example_proxy = client\r\n    .map_request(|r| reqwest::Request::try_from(r).unwrap())\r\n    .map_response(|r| http::Response::try_from(r).unwrap())\r\n    .map_err(|e| panic!(\"axum requires this to be infallible {:?}\", e));\r\n  let rewrite_req_url = axum::middleware::map_request(rewrite_req_url);\r\n\r\n  let example_proxy = rewrite_req_url.layer(example_proxy);\r\n\r\n  let app = Router::new().nest_service(\"/example\", example_proxy);\r\n  let service = app.into_make_service();\r\n\r\n  axum::Server::bind(&\"0.0.0.0:3000\".parse().unwrap())\r\n    .serve(service)\r\n    .await\r\n    .unwrap();\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn rewrite_req_url<B>(mut req: http::Request<B>) -> http::Request<B> {\r\n  let uri = format!(\"https://example.com{}\", req.uri());\r\n  req.headers_mut().insert(\r\n    http::header::HOST,\r\n    http::header::HeaderValue::from_static(\"example.com\"),\r\n  );\r\n  *req.uri_mut() = uri.parse().unwrap();\r\n  req\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed that the wrapper `ImplStream` is not really used anywhere, so I removed it. In my opinion, it is sensible to interpret a `reqwest::Body` as a `Stream` or a `http::Body` on its own.

It follows many of the same code paths as #547, which added support for system proxies on Windows. This does add a dependency on a new crate, `system-configuration`, for communicating with MacOS.\r\n\r\nI did a little bit of renaming, mostly changing the word \"registry\" to \"platform\" to better communicate that the non-environment-variable proxy settings can come from different locations, depending on your target platform.\r\n\r\nI tested this locally via a Rust app I work on (on Ventura 13.5.1), and verified that with these changes (and a local proxy server like Charles active), any requests are forwarded through the proxy. The no proxy case works as well.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1955/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

It's not obvious which `cfg` gates should be applied at the various places `Identity` gets touched, so the code seems fragile in this area.\r\nPerhaps there should be a way to indicate that the `Identity` was successfully consumed? Then if we reach the end of `build()` and we still have an unused identity, we know there's a problem and should return an error.\r\n2. There's no test coverage.
