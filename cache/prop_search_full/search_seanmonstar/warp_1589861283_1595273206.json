An adapter\r\ncan convert `log::Record`s into `tracing::Event`s to be consumed by a\r\n`tracing` subscriber, and a `tracing` feature flag can be enabled to\r\nemit `log` records from `tracing`'s macros. \r\n\r\nHowever, `tracing`'s system for filtering what spans and events should\r\nbe recorded is more efficient than the `log` crate's filtering in many\r\ncases, since it allows filtering decisions to be cached at the callsite,\r\navoiding a call to a filtering function that may, for example, perform\r\nstring matching. This benefit is only available when events are emitted\r\nnatively from `tracing`'s macros, rather than converted by an adapter\r\nfrom `log::Record`s, because `log`'s records lack static callsites.\r\n\r\nThis branch migrates Warp's internal diagnostics to use `tracing` rather\r\nthan `log`. In general, the `tracing` macros are drop-in compatible with\r\n`log`, so the migration only requires changing what crate the macros are\r\nimported from. Tracing's \"log\" feature flag is enabled, causing all the\r\n`tracing` macros to emit `log` records if no `tracing` subscriber has\r\nbeen set. This means that the logs currently emitted for `log` users\r\nshould be unchanged, while `tracing` users should see small performance\r\nimprovements. I've also added a few `tracing` spans to provide context\r\nfor some of the events Warp emits.\r\n\r\nFuture work could involve:\r\n* making the events warp emits more structured, so that they emit \r\n  `tracing`'s structured key-value fields rather than textual messages\r\n* adding more spans to provide context to Warp's events\r\n* adding filters for emitting traces from applications (PR #656)\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Eliza Weisman <eliza@buoyant.io>", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/655/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/655/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/654", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/654/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/654/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/654/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/pull/654", "id": 658378388, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDUwMzQ4NzAw", "number": 654, "title": "Make MissingConnectionUpgrade public ", "user": {"login": "wmain", "id": 5509303, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDkzMDM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5509303?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain", "html_url": "https://github.com/wmain", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wmain/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-07-16T16:57:28Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-17T03:55:02Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-17T03:54:31Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/pulls/654", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/pull/654", "diff_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/pull/654.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/pull/654.patch", "merged_at": "2020-07-17T03:54:31Z"}, "body": "Addresses #653.
