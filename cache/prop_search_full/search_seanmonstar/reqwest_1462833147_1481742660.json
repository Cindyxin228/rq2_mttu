a project from hyper to reqwest to experiment with the native-tls bits, and definitely found myself needing `RequestBuilder` and `Body` exported. Of course I have no expectations here, but thought I'd throw the change in a PR in case it fit into your current plans.\n\nThat said, I don't exactly love the `Body::new` that I ended up exposing. Hyper's `Body` made it easier to create APIs that accept strings, byte arrays, and readers via `Into<Body>`. Sadly `impl <R: Read + 'static> From<R> for Body` is a conflicting implementation (until specialization stabilizes?). In current form, I'd be tempted to wrap `Body` in my API client just to provide the blanket reader conversion for convenience at the loss of knowing the size upfront for types like `Vec<u8>`. But overall, I'm really looking forward to this crate.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
