Now it uses \"native\" `rustls::ServerName`.\r\n * Updated related dependencies.\r\n * Changed all logic in the tls configuration creation.

attempt to fix the conflicting conversion code requried to turn a `Body` into a `JsValue` depending if the body is standalone or if it is part of a form (aka multipart/form-data).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to introduce a new variant to the `crate::wasm::body::Inner` enum that holds the actual content of a body. The new variant allows `Body.to_js_value` to have dedicated codepaths for standalone bodies and form parts. The new variant is contructed by the new `Body.into_part` method. That method is called by the `crate::wasm::multipart::Part::new` constructor and turns an Inner::Body into the new Inner::MultipartPart variant.\r\n\r\nThe drawback is that the new variant leads to some code duplication in the `Body` methods where it mostly shares code with the `Inner::Bytes` variant.\r\n\r\nFor clarity the PR renames the `Inner::Multipart` variant to `Inner::MultipartForm`. It also adds new test cases to cover the serialization of different bodies either standalone or multipart.\r\n\r\nThanks to @crapStone for pointing at the `Inner` enum in #1358 and @skystar-p for the original mutlipart conversion code in #1341.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1364/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

The context is I had some code that relied on using TLS client certificate/keys and was occasionally running into issues where it would throw the \"private key or certificate not found\" error.\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation, I found that, at least in one reproducible case, the client key was in the standard ECSDA PEM format:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\r\ncontents\r\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, the two calls to `pkcs8_keys` and `rsa_private_keys` [shown here](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/master/src/tls.rs#L215) were both returning an empty vec. At face value, it's not obvious that this is going on under the hood and was confusing since I know that `rustls` supports these types of keys. The solution, in my case, was to simply convert the key to the PKCS#8 format in order to conform to what the crate was expecting. It's also worth noting that I was using `curl` as my sanity check which does support this key format out of the box - so there's even more chance of someone getting confused in this case. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution is changing the error message to indicate this possibility - but I thought starting with the documentation was a cleaner approach (it would have saved me about an hour). \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1335/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1334/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334", "id": 1004948964, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA7dkLM4sKtum", "number": 1334, "title": "Allow to clone a Identity", "user": {"login": "silvioprog", "id": 1456829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTY4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1456829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog", "html_url": "https://github.com/silvioprog", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silvioprog/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-09-23T02:32:55Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-29T20:06:17Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-29T20:02:04Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/pulls/1334", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334", "diff_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1334.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-29T20:02:04Z"}, "body": "For example, it can be useful when we need to store an Identity in a hash map.

In addition, according to cURL's rules, a `NO_PROXY` entry without a leading dot should match the domain itself as well as any subdomains (reqwest only handles exact matches if there is no leading dot) and entries _with_ a leading dot should _only_ match subdomains (but request allows exact matches).

compile with this command:\r\n`cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features multipart` \r\n\r\n@seanmonstar Your initial suggestion was to remove #[derive(Clone)] from enum Inner, and change clone() method to try_clone() that matches on the inner type.\r\n\r\nBut after some research I found out that clone could be implemented for both Inner::Bytes and Inner::Multipart with minimal changes. (I added several #[derive(Clone)] attributes) \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this change? I am open to implementing your initial suggestion.\r\n\r\nI am open to feedback and I will address comments asap.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

The allows, for example, to make calls to a local TLS\r\nserver by rerouting a given domain to 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\nThe approach I've taken for the design is to wrap the resolver in an\r\nouter service. This leads to a fair amount of boilerplate code mainly to\r\nbe able to explain the typing to the compiler. The actual business logic\r\nis very simple for the number of lines involved.\r\n\r\nOne alternative option I considered was using an inline `tower_service` instead of a struct. This is possible at the cost of making reqwest's HttpConnector generic, because I could not find a way to state the type of this inlined struct. This was a bigger change than I wanted to make but happy to reconsider, it would reduce the boilerplate for sure.\r\n\r\nNB: this change adds a new dependency (itertools). This is simply to use one struct (itertools::Either) which would be simple to implement directly. If keeping the dependency tree short is needed this is a small change I believe.\r\n\r\nCloses #561", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1277/reactions",

adjustments. Firstly, as in #1105, this adds a `CookieStore` trait so that users can customize where cookies are stored and retrieved on the Client. The adjustments include:\r\n\r\n- Changing the method signatures of `CookieStore` so as to need less allocations. It does make implementing them a little more annoying.\r\n- To remove the breaking change, this makes `ClientBuilder::cookie_store` still take a boolean using `cookie_store` crate as the implementation, and adds `ClientBuilder::cookie_provider` which takes a generic `Arc<impl CookieStore>`.\r\n- To ease probably the most common thing people want to do, which is simply load a few cookies before using the client, the default cookie store is exposed as `reqwest::cookie::Jar`, and it has a simple `add_cookie_str` method.\r\n\r\ncc @pfernie", "reactions": {"url":
