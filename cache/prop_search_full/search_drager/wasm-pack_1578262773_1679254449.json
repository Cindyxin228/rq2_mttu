Unfortunately, this causes a problem for [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) when watching the `pkg` directory. Webpack is unable to recover its watching and so any watch server must be restarted, which is a blocker when using it.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there was [some debate](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/986#discussion_r676967231) about whether to remove the `pkg` directory. It is unclear to me what the actual benefits of it are, and whether this PR re-introduces some other problem. However, wasmpack appears to have existed as per the behaviour of this PR for a few years.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverses the change made in the above commit and fixes https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/1099.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/issues/1110/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/issues/1110/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/issues/1095", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/issues/1095/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/issues/1095/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/issues/1095/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/drager/wasm-pack/pull/1095", "id": 1082524417, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBzovgs4v90t3", "number": 1095, "title": "0.10.2", "user": {"login": "drager", "id": 1957563, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTc1NjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1957563?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager", "html_url": "https://github.com/drager", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drager/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-12-16T18:33:50Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-16T19:56:36Z", "closed_at": "2021-12-16T19:56:32Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/drager/wasm-pack/pulls/1095", "html_url": "https://github.com/drager/wasm-pack/pull/1095", "diff_url": "https://github.com/drager/wasm-pack/pull/1095.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/drager/wasm-pack/pull/1095.patch", "merged_at": "2021-12-16T19:56:32Z"}, "body": "Make sure these boxes are checked!
