`okapi-operation` 0.3.0-rc1 there [is a loop](https://docs.rs/okapi-operation/0.3.0-rc1/src/okapi_operation/builder.rs.html#150) over a `std::collections::HashMap` which means it will visit the keys in an [\"arbitrary order\"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.iter). \r\n\r\nThis is because the seeder in the default HashMap implementation is seeded with a [random number generator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/struct.RandomState.html) to prevent HashDoS attacks.\r\n\r\nIn our use case we commit the results of [`.build()`](https://docs.rs/okapi-operation/0.3.0-rc1/okapi_operation/struct.OpenApiBuilder.html#method.build)ing to our version tracking system, which changes most commits as the generation function is not stable. Note that this would also cause problems for users who run ANY automated tests against the results of the [`.build()`](https://docs.rs/okapi-operation/0.3.0-rc1/okapi_operation/struct.OpenApiBuilder.html#method.build) function, e.g. snapshots.\r\n\r\nOkapi's [Map type](https://docs.rs/okapi/latest/okapi/type.Map.html) uses an [IndexMap](https://docs.rs/schemars/0.8.16/schemars/type.Map.html) to preserve insertion order when the `preserve_order` flag is enabled (as in this repo).
