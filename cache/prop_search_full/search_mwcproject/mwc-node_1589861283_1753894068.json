version that builds signatures for 2 keys (P1 and P2) that are verifiable against the single public key `P := P1 + H(P1||P2) * P2`. This will give us the same security properties without the need to modify any crypto primitives.\r\n\r\n`build_composite_pubkey` was made a separate function so that callers may batch verify 2-key signatures alongside standard single element schnorr sigs using the existing `verify_batch` function.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/issues/46/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/issues/46/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/issues/43", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/issues/43/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/issues/43/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/issues/43/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-node/pull/43", "id": 936223527, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjgzMDAzMDEz", "number": 43, "title": "fix: Ncurses interface not working properly in Docker container + added Tor support", "user": {"login": "dennisvanderpool", "id": 24899089, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODk5MDg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24899089?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool", "html_url": "https://github.com/dennisvanderpool", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennisvanderpool/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-07-03T10:19:06Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-23T00:56:05Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-23T00:56:04Z", "author_association": "NONE", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwcproject/mwc-node/pulls/43", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-node/pull/43", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-node/pull/43.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-node/pull/43.patch", "merged_at": "2022-02-23T00:56:04Z"}, "body": "fixes:\r\n- Ncurses not showing properly\r\n- Tor binary added, so tor will work\r\n\r\nUser Interface was showing weird characters instead of proper Ncurses interface.

This was requested by @vek-kal\r\nThis can be accomplished by using an additional build step in Azure pipelines which creates the Docs, and then pushes them to the Gitpages Repo.\r\n\r\nThis PR has no Impact on Consensus or any actual Code that is connected to the Node itself. \r\nBut it does hook into the CI Build process as its own Build Job, so it shouldn't matter if it would fail. \r\nTherefore the impact should be minimal.\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions or Inputs, please don't hesitate to give me a Tag @bayk.\r\nAlso take your time reviewing this as there is no haste to Push API docs out.\r\n\r\n### **Approach/workflow:**\r\n1. Execute Cargo Doc Command to generate Docs (only for API)\r\n2. Clone current Git Pages Repo into extra Directory\r\n3. Copy over Changed Docs (overwrite git pages repo locally)\r\n4. Push Commit back to Git Pages Repo\r\n5. Check if Github Pages Build was succesfull (so this check will fail if there is an Issue with Docs)\r\nIm not totally sure if this check would actually get this step to fail (its the last command executed, returns a 200 code if AOK)\r\nStep 5 might be unnecessarry/ineffective as Im not sure how long it takes for the build status to be returned.\r\n\r\n### **Needed actions to implement this PR/workflow:** \r\n\r\n1. Create PAT for user with push access to mwcproject.github.io\r\n2. Save this personal Access token as a _secret_ variable in Azure (named 'github_pat')\r\n3. (might not be needed) explicitly add the PAT user as a member to the mwcproject.github.io Repository where our Gitpages reside\r\n\r\n4. Merge this PR and check if it build successfully upon next release \r\n\r\n\r\n### **Explanations of added Values:** \r\n ` ghpages_user: 'mwcproject'   `(User of Github Pages Repository - the organization account)\r\n`  ghpages_repo: 'mwcproject.github.io'` (Github Pages Repository - that pushed code will be pushed and then availlable via http at mwcproject.github.io)\r\n  `ghpages_auth_header: '$(echo -n \"${gh_user}:$(github_pat)\" | base64);' `(This is needed to query the Github API to check if the Pages actually rendered.)\r\n\r\n### **Remarks** \r\n\r\nIf there is an Issue building croaring-sys-mw then this may help https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/1189#issuecomment-403578676\r\nIm quite sure this was an Issue isolated to my OS tho.\r\n\r\n###
