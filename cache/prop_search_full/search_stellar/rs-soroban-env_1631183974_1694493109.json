There may be better solutions.\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/pull/1068 where I was experimenting with feeding the Env objects with invalid references.\r\n\r\nThe Host has a `check_val_integrity` function that is called on every Val it sees in order to prevent bad Vals from entering the environment, in particular it errors when it sees objects with broken references.\r\n\r\nThis function ends up calling `visit_obj_untyped`. When _that_ function fails to find an object body it returns this\r\n\r\n```\r\n            Err(self.err(\r\n                ScErrorType::Object,\r\n                ScErrorCode::MissingValue,\r\n                \"unknown object reference\",\r\n                &[obj.to_val()],\r\n            ))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen diagnostics are on, the effect of this is to log an \"unknown object reference\" event that contains the broken object, then immediately generate an error; while generating that error it attempts to externalize the diagnostic it just logged;\r\nthat diagnostic contains a broken object, and while externalizing it will generate more errors, etc. forever.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me why this doesn't smash the stack, but instead iloops (maybe the XDR DepthLimiter is helping). Here is a ~3k frame backtrace captured in gdb: https://gist.github.com/brson/aa2799208123895316228ca0cb425317\r\n\r\n### Known limitations\r\n\r\n- This loses information about the broken object.\r\n- There may be other ways to get into similar situations with the event log.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1028/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1028/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1026", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1026/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1026/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1026/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/pull/1026", "id": 1874469410, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHPHozc5ZLq-d", "number": 1026, "title": "Fix encode contract events metering", "user": {"login": "jayz22", "id": 13401372, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDAxMzcy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13401372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22", "html_url": "https://github.com/jayz22", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jayz22/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-08-30T22:35:58Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-01T18:51:49Z", "closed_at": "2023-09-01T18:51:48Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/pulls/1026", "html_url": "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/pull/1026", "diff_url": "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/pull/1026.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/pull/1026.patch", "merged_at": "2023-09-01T18:51:48Z"}, "body": "### What\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/issues/3902\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nPreviously it calls `metered_collect` with the input being the size of the event buffer.

The idea here is:\r\n\r\n1. We split object references as before in two types differentiated by their low bit, but now they're \"absolute\" and \"relative\". Relative references indirect through a context-local table that just holds absolute references.\r\n2. We only _really_ care about this issue when dealing with wasm contracts. Local-testing / native contracts have no isolation / complete system visibility anyways, there's no point really worrying about \"who can see what\".\r\n3. Therefore the wasm VM argument-marshalling path is a natural point to do the relative-to-absolute translation. We translate relative references to absolute on the way in to the host, and absolute to relative on the way out. Wasm never gets to see any absolute references. If they forge one, we refuse it on the way in.\r\n\r\n(There is a slight downside in the current implementation which is that if you return the same absolute reference multiple times we'll create new relative references on each return.

compiled contracts are not metered)\r\n- Accessing entries outside of the footprint - this is probably the most controversial change, but there is really no indication/expectation that storage interface doesn't behave as a key-value database and hence it's pretty easy to write logic that relies on that fact without considering the existence of the footprint. `try_call` recovering from

(ser/deser will be covered by rs-stellar-xdr's `ReadXdr`, `WriteXdr`, which are already depth-limited).\r\n- Introduces a new `pub const DEFAULT_HOST_DEPTH_LIMIT: u32 = 100` in the host and we can later choose to make this a network config parameter.\r\n- Also added some tests to demonstrate depth limit working for various code paths.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n[TODO: Why this change is being made.

and it's just needless code bloat to do the 4-way-switch in the guest.\r\n\r\nI also added a bunch of convenience infallible const member functions on `[IU]{64,128,256}Small` types to allow constructing them directly from `[iu]32` to make it cheaper in contracts that want \"small bignum\" immediates like 0, +/- 1 or whatever.\r\n\r\nPR is still waiting on a change @dmkozh is working on

storage layer).
