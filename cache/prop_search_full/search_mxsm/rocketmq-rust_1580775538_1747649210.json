3.20.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">tempfile's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.20.0</h2>\n<p>This release mostly unifies the behavior/capabilities around &quot;keeping&quot; temporary files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename <code>Builder::keep(bool)</code> (via deprecation) to <code>Builder::disable_cleanup(bool)</code> to make it clear that behaves differently from <code>NamedTempFile::keep()</code>. The former disables automatic cleanup while the latter <em>consumes</em> the <code>NamedTempFile</code> object entirely and unsets the &quot;temporary file&quot; attribute (on Windows).</li>\n<li>Rename <code>TempDir::into_path</code> (via deprecation) to <code>TempDir::keep</code> to mirror <code>NamedTempFile::keep</code>.</li>\n<li>Add <code>TempDir::disable_cleanup</code>, <code>NamedTempFile::disable_cleanup</code>, and <code>TempPath::disable_cleanup</code> making it possible to disable automatic cleanup in-place <em>after</em> creating a temporary file/directory (equivalent to calling <code>Builder::disable_cleanup</code> before creating the file/directory).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, it adds a few spooled temporary file features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>SpooledTempFile::into_file</code> for turning a <code>SpooledTempFile</code> into a regular unnamed temporary file, writing it to the backing storage (&quot;rolling&quot; it) if it was still stored in-memory.</li>\n<li>Add <code>spooled_tempfile_in</code> and <code>SpooledTempFile::new_in</code> methods for creating spooled temporary files in a specific directory. This makes it possible to choose the backing device for your spooled temporary file which is rather important on Linux where the default temporary directory is likely backed by memory (defeating the entire point of having a spooled temporary file).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, this release improves documentation, especially the top-level documentation explaining which temporary file type to use.</p>\n<p><strong>BREAKING</strong> for those with <code>deny(warnings)</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Builder::keep</code> deprecated in favor of <code>Builder::disable_cleanup</code>.</li>\n<li><code>TempDir::into_path</code> is deprecated in favor of <code>TempDir::keep</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BREAKING</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/99ffea61ade621161db326b6745c7b36a90ddbd0\"><code>99ffea6</code></a> chore: release v3.20.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/358\">#358</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/bd2b2674423ae6598070fab30e6627810ac282a9\"><code>bd2b267</code></a> feat: make it possible to disable cleanup in-place after creation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/355\">#355</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/3b30099abd7585a9b6600276f6dcdfa557e88f19\"><code>3b30099</code></a> ci: really check docs for warnings (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/357\">#357</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/f701f5245624b8cfcd782dfd62fcfe86d35c173b\"><code>f701f52</code></a> ci: check docs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/356\">#356</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/d34afe99fd93bb13253128cc58dfc4032edfa5a5\"><code>d34afe9</code></a> doc: improve SpooledData documentation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/6deb42e04ceb2f2c306510b1605d9548e77868e5\"><code>6deb42e</code></a> doc: make it easier to pick the correct tempfile constructor/type</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/e284782c6c1c2f565af2ab9b5c0be9f9c5ed3607\"><code>e284782</code></a> feat: allow creating spooled temporary files in a specific directory (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/353\">#353</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/07edc310a5c8725346cd2bb2a5d065ff298f4fa0\"><code>07edc31</code></a> feat: implement <code>SpooledTempFile::into_file</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/352\">#352</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/b1223553bb888e35bab7675fbac235e4be6eaf7e\"><code>b122355</code></a> fix: add must_use attribute to TempDir::keep (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/351\">#351</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/cbd1e976e106d4a12432e124494f735bf40eafe2\"><code>cbd1e97</code></a> feat: rename <code>TempDir::into_path</code> to <code>TempDir::keep</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/349\">#349</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/compare/v3.19.1...v3.20.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=tempfile&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=3.19.1&new-version=3.20.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

improved readability and consistency.\n  - No changes to application behavior, logic, or user-facing features.\n- **Refactor**\n  - Standardized parameter naming in select internal functions for consistency. \n- **Bug Fixes**\n  - Corrected a string interpolation issue in one function to ensure proper variable substitution in key parsing.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes

impl.</li>\n<li>More <code>ZeroableInOption</code> impls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.22</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the <code>pod_saturating</code> feature, which adds <code>Pod</code> impls for <code>Saturating&lt;T&gt;</code>\nwhen <code>T</code> is already <code>Pod</code>.</li>\n<li>A bump in the minimum <code>bytemuck_derive</code> dependency from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 to\navoid a bug if you have a truly ancient <code>cargo.lock</code> file sitting around.</li>\n<li>Adds <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> impls to <code>BoxBytes</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.21</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement <code>Pod</code> and <code>Zeroable</code> for <code>core::arch::{x86, x86_64}::__m512</code>, <code>__m512d</code> and <code>__m512i</code> without nightly.\nRequires Rust 1.72, and is gated through the <code>avx512_simd</code> cargo feature.</li>\n<li>Allow the use of <code>must_cast_mut</code> and <code>must_cast_slice_mut</code> in const contexts.\nRequires Rust 1.83, and is gated through the <code>must_cast_extra</code> cargo feature.</li>\n<li>internal: introduced the <code>maybe_const_fn</code> macro that allows defining some function\nto be const depending upon some <code>cfg</code> predicate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.20</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New functions to allocate zeroed <code>Arc</code> and <code>Rc</code>. Requires Rust 1.82</li>\n<li><code>TransparentWrapper</code> impls for <code>core::cmp::Reverse</code> and <code>core::num::Saturating</code>.</li>\n<li>internal: Simplified the library's <code>fill_zeroes</code> calls to <code>write_bytes</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.19</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds the <code>#[track_caller]</code> attribute to functions which may panic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.18</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds the <code>latest_stable_rust</code> cargo feature, which is a blanket feature that turns all other features on that are both sound and compatible with Stable rust.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.17.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds <code>#[repr(C)]</code> to the <code>union Transmute&lt;A, B&gt;</code> type that's used internally\nfor most of the transmutations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.17.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Makes the <code>must_cast</code> versions of the by-value and by-ref casts be <code>const</code>.\nThe mut ref cast is unaffected for now (mut references aren't yet stable in <code>const fn</code>).\nThis increases the MSRV of using that particular feature from 1.57 to 1.64.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.16.3</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
