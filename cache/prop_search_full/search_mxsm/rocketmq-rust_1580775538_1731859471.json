Wrapper</a> to encapsulate the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli\">CLI</a>. This will help ensure that the Action gets updates quicker.</p>\n<h3>Migration Guide</h3>\n<p>The <code>v5</code> release also coincides with the opt-out feature for tokens for public repositories. In the repository settings page in codecov.io, you can set the ability for Codecov to receive a coverage report from ANY souce. This will allow contributors or other members of a repository to upload without needing access to the Codecov token.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]<br />\n<strong>The following arguments have been

handling across various components.\n\t- Introduced `CheetahString` in place of `String` for improved performance and type safety in multiple structs and methods.\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\t- Adjusted string handling in methods to ensure consistent usage of `CheetahString`, improving robustness in string operations.\n\n- **Documentation**\n\t- Updated method signatures and comments to reflect the transition to `CheetahString`.\n\n- **Chores**\n\t- Removed outdated test modules related to the previous string implementation.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai
