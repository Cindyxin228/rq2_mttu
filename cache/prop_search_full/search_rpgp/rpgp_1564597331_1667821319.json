A\r\nproblem I ran into is that as part of signature verification you\r\nneed to feed signature state into the hasher (which was already fed\r\nthe cleartext being verified). This means that you either need to\r\nrehash the cleartext for each signature or maintain a per-signature\r\nhasher. Both of these solutions are inefficient.\r\n\r\nThe hasher types used by this crate implement Clone. This means you\r\ncan have a single per-algorithm hasher then clone it before feeding\r\nin signature state so you don't taint the hasher and can reuse it\r\nfor other signatures. However, because this crate's wrapper types\r\ndon't implement Clone, this optimization isn't available.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements Clone on this crate's hasher wrappers to\r\nenable this optimization.\r\n\r\nWe may need to extend the Hasher trait with a clone-like function\r\nto make this fully work.
