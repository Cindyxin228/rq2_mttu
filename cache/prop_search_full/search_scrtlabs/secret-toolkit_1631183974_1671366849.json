importing the `ViewingKeyStore` trait.\r\n\r\nThe top-level storage key can be changed by implementing the trait on your own type:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse

init/handle/query messages of Secret Contracts. When used this way, the field will be expected to be a base64 encoded string of the serialized form of the type `T`, using the chosen serialization method in `S`. The field will behave just like `T` in most contexts, and will the `T` instance will be available under the `.inner` field of the `Base64Of` object. When serializing back to JSON to send the message somewhere, the `Base64Of` field will serialize `inner: T` using the chosen `S` and then encode the result as a base64 string.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for cases like the `msg` field of contracts that implement the SNIP-20 `Receive` interface.\r\n\r\nSee the tests at the end of the new module for some usage examples, but in general it allows you to rewrite this:\r\n```Rust\r\npub enum HandleMsg {\r\n    Receive {\r\n        sender: HumanAddr,\r\n        from: HumanAddr,\r\n        amount: Uint128,\r\n        memo: Option<String>,\r\n        msg: Binary, // interpreted as ReceiveOperation\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```Rust\r\npub enum HandleMsg {\r\n    Receive {\r\n        sender: HumanAddr,\r\n        from: HumanAddr,\r\n        amount: Uint128,\r\n        memo: Option<String>,\r\n        msg: Base64JsonOf<ReceiveOperation>,\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich would validate the correctness of `msg`, and allow you to directly match on `.msg.inner`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrtlabs/secret-toolkit/issues/26/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,
