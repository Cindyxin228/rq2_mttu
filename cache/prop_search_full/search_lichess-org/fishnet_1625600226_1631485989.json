spawning a child process. As a console application, it will connect to the same \"conhost\" and output to the same screen. I've also made a [toy example](https://github.com/kriolyth/self-restart) to see if there are caveats, and indeed _there are_.\r\n\r\nThis approach works as expected when the application is launched on its own and it created its own \"conhost\" instance. If it is launched from a terminal (cmd or powershell), then after parent application closes, terminal regains input and output. At the same time, the child also writes to same terminal window, but cannot process any input (not even Ctrl+C). Thankfully, closing the terminal window also stops the newly spawned application.\r\n\r\nThat means, the least surprising way to use autoupate is to create a link to the application, add an \"--auto-update\" flag and use the link to start application. Perhaps, if autoupdate was also an option in configuration file, the process would be even smoother.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lichess-org/fishnet/issues/203/reactions",

[PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) is basically a bash script with all the instructions necessary to pull any dependencies, download the program, compile it if necessary, and then install it on the system.\r\nI added one that works using the [latest binary](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=fishnet-bin), the [latest source tarball](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=fishnet), and also the [latest commit](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=fishnet-git).\r\n\r\nI think this will
