runtime hooks for `tokio`\r\n- [x] Implement runtime hooks for `async-std`\r\n- [x] Finish code generator for request-specific extension functions.\r\n- [x] Corner cases\r\n- [ ] Testing + examples\r\n- [ ] Write full X11 tutorial\r\n\r\nPossibly shoddy design definitions:\r\n\r\n- Wrapped items should probably not expose `tracing_subscriber::Instrumented`.\r\n- `RawRequest` may need a lifetime.\r\n- The entirety of `Prefetch`\r\n- ~~A lot of repeated code between `BasicDisplay` and `SyncDisplay`.~~ Fixed by making `SyncDisplay` a wrapper around `BasicDisplay`, at the cost of some concurrency.\r\n- Impl of `Void` makes `bytemuck` a public dependency.\r\n- `x11rb-protocol` is a public dependency, but I don't think I can avoid that.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
