This can allow optimizations in client code in some cases.</li>\n<li>Added <code>cr_lines</code> and <code>unicode_lines</code> feature flags to the crate, to manage what line endings are recognized and tracked.  This allows, for example, building Ropey to only recognize line feed as a line break.  <code>unicode_lines</code> is on by default, and corresponds to the original behavior.</li>\n<li>Implemented <code>std::hash::Hash</code> for <code>Rope</code> and <code>RopeSlice</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Misc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Split <code>str_utils</code> module out into a separate crate, <code>str_indices</code>.
