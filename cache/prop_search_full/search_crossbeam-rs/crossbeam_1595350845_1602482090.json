associated docs & doctests for these, but in general they share implementations with the existing `timeout` versions, so I didn't add additional unit tests.\r\n\r\nDidn't add a deadline version of the

crossbeam, which would want to minimize abstraction).\r\n\r\nDidn't add Parker::park_deadline, since that would have involved a heavier refactor of the `Parker` implementation (probably removing the

`crossbeam-queue` has two error types: `PopError`, `PushError`.\r\n* `PopError` is a unit struct with no field, and is returned by `ArrayQueue::pop` and `SegQueue::pop` if the queue is empty.\r\n* `PushError` is a tuple struct with a public field that stores the element that user tried to push, and is returned by `ArrayQueue::push` if the queue is full.\r\n\r\nI guess the current API was influenced by channels, but there is only one kind(variant) of error in each, and unlike channels, multiple kinds(variants) of errors do not occur.\r\nAnd, neither of these provides additional information about the error (fields are all public, so it doesn't seem like they are going to provide them in the future).\r\n\r\nSo, APIs that return `Option` (on `pop` methods) and `Result` (on `ArrayQueue::push`) without our own errors are simple, and I think it is preferable. \r\n(Especially for the `pop` methods, it will be more consistent, because all other public `pop` methods in crossbeam return `Option`.)\r\n\r\n(Of course, this is a breaking change, but the master already has some breaking changes.)", "reactions": {"url":
