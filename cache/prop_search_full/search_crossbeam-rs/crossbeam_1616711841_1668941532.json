implement a straightforward MPMC ring-buffer and close #680.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a new method `push_or_swap` to `ArrayQueue`, that atomically swaps the oldest element when the queue is full, instead of returning `Err` back to the caller like `push` does. As such, `push_or_swap` never fails to insert the element into the queue.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any benchmarks I could run, (am I missing anything obvious?), however I did run benchmarks from [ring-channel](https://github.com/brunocodutra/ring-channel) where I compared this implementation against an emulation of a ring-buffer, that keeps popping elements until pushing succeeds, i.e. something like the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhile let Err(v) = q.push(value) {\r\n   q.pop();\r\n   value = v;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI got the results below on my machine, which show that `push_or_swap` fares much better when capacity is low and the probability that pushing fails is high (the baseline was set to the `push`-based implementation).\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Note 1:** the relevant metric in the benchmarks below is the throughput, which is scaled by the \"channel efficiency\", defined as `total_number_of_messages_received / total_number_of_messages_sent`.\r\n* **Note 2:** benchmark names are suffixed by `SB/PxR/C`, where S is the size of the element in bytes, P is the number of threads producing, R the number of threads consuming, and C is the capacity of the ring-buffer: \r\n* **Note 3:** the source code for the benchmarks is [available here](https://github.com/brunocodutra/ring-channel/blob/master/benches/throughput.rs#L18-L48).\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmarking mpmc/Block/32B/8x8/1: Warming up for 3.0000 s\r\nWarning: Unable to complete 100 samples in 5.0s.
