caching](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/v0.10.0/frontend/dockerfile/docs/syntax.md#run---mounttypecache). It replaces #210, which used a custom approach to caching directories between builds in favor of a more Docker native approach (although we may still need a custom solution in the future).\r\n\r\nTo enable caching you can provide a `--cache-key` arg to the `build` command. If set, this key will be used as a prefix for the \"id\" mount option.\r\n\r\nBuildKit caching works by caching a certain directory(ies) for `RUN` commands. The directory is restored before the command is run and wiped after. **This means that the contents of the cache directory do not appear in the final image**.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the caching only works locally in the same way that layer caching works. However, I am planning on expanding the functionality to enable [using a remote image as the cache source](https://dille.name/slides/2020-01-22/020_advanced/025_build_cache/buildkit.final/).\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n```\r\nnixpacks build . --cache-key my-cache-key\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Provider Caching\r\n\r\nInstall and build phases have a new API: `add_cache_directory(&mut self, dir: String)` that providers can use to cache a specific directory for either the install or build phases. This PR implements caching for\r\n\r\n- Node\r\n  + Install: Package (NPM/Yarn/PNPM) cache directories, Cypress global cache\r\n  + Build: NextJS `.next/cache` directories, `node_modules/.cache` directory\r\n- Python\r\n  + Install: Pip global cache\r\n- Rust\r\n  + Build: `~/.cargo/git`, `~/.cargo/registry`, `/app/target`\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nDon't take these results too seriously. They are mainly here to illustrate that caching is actually beneficial to the builds.\r\n\r\nBuilding a monorepo frontend NextJS app with the following command\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run -- build examples/node-monorepo --build-cmd \"yarn workspace client build\" --start-cmd \"yarn workspace client start\" --name monorepo --cache-key cache-key\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Phase | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| Install | 19.9s | 2.9s | 85% |\r\n| Build | 8.0s | 4.6s | 43% |\r\n\r\nBuilding a starter Django application\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run -- build examples/python-django --name django --cache-key d1\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Phase | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| Install | 14.6s | 9.6s | 38% |\r\n\r\nBuilding a Rust rocket app with no musl\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run -- build examples/rust-rocket --name rocket --cache-key rr1 --env \"NIXPACKS_NO_MUSL=1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Phase | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| Build | 80.6s | 0.3s | 99% |\r\n\r\n_Note: The cache layer for rust dependencies is fairly large_\r\n\r\n## Additional Changes\r\n\r\n- Force buildkit if `cache-key` is set\r\n- Fixed the staticfile example\r\n- `find_directories` app API that is similar to the `find_files` method\r\n- Copy binary out of Rust target dir \r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks/issues/201", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/railwayapp/nixpacks/issues/259/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

It is related to the https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks/pull/195 which adds a special case for the node-canvas NPM package. To accomplish this a few things were changed\r\n\r\n- [Base image]: Specify `-l` when starting the container so that `~/.profile` is sourced\r\n- [Setup phase]: new `add_library` method that allows providers to specify which Nix libraries are available. The library paths are calculated with `lib.makeLibraryPath` from the Nix standard library\r\n- [Nix generation]: When generating the `environment.nix` file, create a `libraries.sh` file with the new `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable that is copied to the Nix profile which will be sourced on startup\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nIf the Node provider setup phase is\r\n\r\n<img width=\"605\" alt=\"image\"
