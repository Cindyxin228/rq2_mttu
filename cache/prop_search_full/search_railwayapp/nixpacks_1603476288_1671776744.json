providers. The providers must explicitly be set in the `nixpacks.toml` file. Extending the auto detected provider is supported with the `\"...\"` syntax.\r\n\r\n### Phase names\r\n\r\nThe phases from the first provider in the list will keep the same names that they were created with. Subsequent providers phases will be prefixed with the name of the provider (e.g. `rust:setup`). This is done since phase names cannot have collisions as well as to correctly sort the phase build order. The rust build phase does not depend on the node install phase, and prefixing the phase names ensures that dependency isn't created.\r\n\r\nOne downside of this approach is that to override the behaviour of a specific non-first phase, you have to do something like\r\n```toml\r\n[phases.\"rust:build\"]\r\ncmds = [\"...\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a bit awkward. This is only because of allowed characters in the toml language. If the config format is Json, then it is a bit cleaner.\r\n\r\nSuggestions of another prefix character besides `:` is welcome.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nThis plan will use **only** the node and rust providers\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nproviders = [\"node\", \"rust\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis plan will use the auto detected provider and python\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nproviders = [\"...\", \"python\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why is this experimental\r\n\r\nWhile testing this, I've noticed that many of the providers do not handle when specific language files (e.g. package.json) are not found when creating the build plan. Install, build, and start phases should only be added to the plan when appropriate. Some providers assume that since it is running, then there will always be an install, build, or start phases. These kinks will be discovered through use of multiple providers in different app scenarios. When using multiple providers, there is a warning that there might be some bugs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3044853/198502969-dc7bc208-55df-4775-bc19-8ae8f5a6ae8f.png)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

( although its installation guide does not suggest to install COBOLGet locally with a `package.json`, so maybe its not a node provider thing ).\r\n- I believe each COBOL is a separate thing ( you cant import COBOLS into other COBOLS ). Ive done a bit of looking and have seen some people concatenate many COBOLS into one output binary. We should support this right? [example](https://github.com/azac/cobol-on-wheelchair/blob/master/downhill.sh). Behind a flag or automatically if we find multiple COBOLS.\r\n\r\nIve reached out to a COBOL community asking for their standard workflows, still awaiting a response, but the community is not that active so i don't hold much hope.
