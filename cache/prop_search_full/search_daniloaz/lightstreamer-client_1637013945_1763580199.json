Once all subscriptions have been unsubscribed, the LS client shuts down.\r\n\r\nIt was designed to be as \"non-breaking\" as possible, meaning people already implementing this library should be able to continue as they were before.\r\n\r\nThe whole things revolves around cloning to the \"subscription_sender\" before going into the connect wait. To be able to unsubscribe there is also a new blocking function that will return the id of the subscription so that it can be used to unsubscribe.\r\n\r\nSome small changes are needed for the ig trading api library if you merge this but I will show you that in a separate PR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/issues/1", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/issues/1/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/issues/1/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/issues/1/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/pull/1", "id": 2458826186, "node_id": "PR_kwDOLThkbs53_vun", "number": 1, "title": "Addition of Tracing crate to logging options", "user": {"login": "aihphysics", "id": 24621514, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjIxNTE0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24621514?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics", "html_url": "https://github.com/aihphysics", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aihphysics/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-08-10T00:47:56Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-11T17:58:23Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-11T17:58:23Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/pulls/1", "html_url": "https://github.com/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/pull/1", "diff_url": "https://github.com/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/pull/1.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/daniloaz/lightstreamer-client/pull/1.patch", "merged_at": "2024-08-11T17:58:23Z"}, "body": "Added an enum and method LightstreamClient to allow configuration with logging using the Tracing crate.
