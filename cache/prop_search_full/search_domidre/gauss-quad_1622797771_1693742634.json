I am using it in a rather large project and was therefore looking for opportunities to trim dependencies. Therefore I looked through your crate and made the following changes:\r\n\r\n* The dependency nalgebra was updated to 0.30\r\n* The dependency statrs was removed, since only the gamma function was used from this (rather extensive) package. The gamma function and its tests were copied into gamma.rs (with a reference to statrs).\r\n* The dependency assert_float_eq was replaced with approx, since approx is the standard for floating-point comparisons, avoiding doubling of identical dependencies in larger projects\r\n* approx was made a dev-dependency (assert_float_eq  was originally a normal dependency despite only being used in tests).\r\n\r\nAll tests are passing. The number of dependencies was reduced from 3 to 1 (+1 dev-dependency). All other properties of the crate are unchanged. I did clean up some of the doc tests (e.g. removed `#[macro-use]` and `extern crate`).\r\n\r\nIf you like those changes, consider merging them :-)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DomiDre/gauss-quad/issues/13/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DomiDre/gauss-quad/issues/13/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
