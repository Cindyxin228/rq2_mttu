Currently it is getting harder to develop this codebase, especially for multiple platforms. Currently, I have encountered these problems:\r\n\r\n1. Cross-compilation is not possible because of a bug in the protobuf conan package.\r\n2. We use conan as a package manager,. After the release of conan 2.0, some dependencies stopped updating.\r\n3. Writing an HTTP API in C++ is ugly\r\n4. The codebase can be compiled only with GCC or VS, we can't use clion because of a lack of support C++20\r\n5. CI infrastructure with two docker images is too expensive\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nI've ntegrated Rust into CMake scripts and we can use rust code in C++ by using the `cxx.rs` library. My plan is to start migrating from base classes and re-write all the levels of the application step by step.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Other information:\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/issues/251/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/issues/251/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/issues/250", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/issues/250/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/issues/250/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/issues/250/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/pull/250", "id": 1636506568, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGk2yN85Mrou6", "number": 250, "title": "Speed up loading entries at start", "user": {"login": "atimin", "id": 67068, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67068?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin", "html_url": "https://github.com/atimin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atimin/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-03-22T21:15:18Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-22T21:39:26Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-22T21:39:25Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/reductstore/reductstore/pulls/250", "html_url": "https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/pull/250", "diff_url": "https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/pull/250.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/pull/250.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-22T21:39:25Z"}, "body": "Closes #\r\n\r\n### Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] CHANGELOG.md have been updated (for bug fixes / features / docs)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nThe database parse all descriptors to calculate the number of records and size of stored data.
