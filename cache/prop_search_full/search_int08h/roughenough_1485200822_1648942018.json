`Server` struct.\r\n* Moves the core server processing into a standalone function, suitable for calling from a fuzz wrapper.\r\n* Adds a `MemoryConfig` struct, to allow a fuzz wrapper to easily create a `ServerConfig`.\r\n* Adds a new method `Server::send_to_self`, gated behind `#[cfg(fuzzing)]`. It allows the server to feed messages to itself using a separate client `UdpSocket` instance.\r\n* Add a new  `--output`flag to `roughenough-client`, which causes the client to write all of its requests to a file. This can be used to easily generate fuzzer inputs to the server.\r\n\r\nI've left this PR as a series of several commits, but I can squash them once you think this is ready to merge.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDeveloper Certificate of Origin\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.\r\n1 Letterman Drive\r\nSuite D4700\r\nSan Francisco, CA,
