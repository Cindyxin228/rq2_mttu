adds ability to use rustls over native-tls, this can be useful for two reasons:\r\n- performance (though I haven't checked by myself, but this [article](https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html) shows pretty decent results)\r\n- reduce extra dependencies (since native-tls requires some C ssl library)\r\n\r\nPrevious feature `tls` is now an alias to `tls-native-tls` (and \"meta\" feature `_tls` is now shows that some of TLS features had been enabled), so on other words everything should be backward compatible.\r\n\r\nAlso I've extended CI to make cover native-tls and rustls as well (for that builds I have to run docker manually, since `services` executed before cloning repo, while I need some files from it), and clickhouse-server in that checks does not expose `9000` port, which should ensure that everything goes via secure protocol.\r\n\r\nP.S. one interesting thing that I found out is that rustls is faster for establishing connections (though I did not dig deeply enough, since there are tons of reasons for this, especially in the library that doing cryptography).\r\n\r\nRefs:

ability to add any ClickHouse query settings [1].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Core/Settings.h\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to pass them:\r\n- via connection string (any unknown parameter now parsed as query\r\n  setting as important, i.e. if there are no such query setting, the\r\n  query will fail)\r\n- via with_setting() API (and this is preferable, since it allows to\r\n  pass important flag)\r\n\r\nAlso note, that ClickHouse supports multiple ways of encoding settings\r\nin the protocol:\r\n- \"native\" values (very old ClickHouse)\r\n- or simple strings\r\n\r\nBut to support \"native\" format you need to know the type of the setting,\r\nso you need to pass correct type to the with_setting API, though the\r\ntype will be used only for older ClickHouse versions.\r\n\r\nNote, that I've tested \"native\" format with ClickHouse v19, and it works\r\nOK.\r\n\r\nNote, that for this I have to implement missing bits in protocol up to `DBMS_MIN_REVISION_WITH_SETTINGS_SERIALIZED_AS_STRINGS` (see the first patch in the patch set).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/suharev7/clickhouse-rs/issues/193/reactions",
