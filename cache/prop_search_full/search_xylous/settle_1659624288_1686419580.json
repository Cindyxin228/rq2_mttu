At first:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to write file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" }', /home/user/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/settle-0.38.0/src/io.rs:34:23\r\n```\r\n\r\nline 34 in io.rs calls to line 62 in config.rs:\r\n`write_to_file(&config_path, &data);`\r\n\r\nsolution: handle the directory first, by having `config_path` refer to the dir, and add `config_file` to refer to the .yaml. Then, add a check to make sure the dir exists, and create it if it doesn't using the already-written `mkdir`.\r\n\r\nnext problem:\r\n`    let result = match path.chars().next().unwrap() {`\r\n\r\nline 31 of config.rs calls `next()` before doing anything on the `&str` - since the default in the code is the empty string \"\", the subsequent `.unwrap()` causes a panic\r\n\r\nsolution: not entirely clear; I just added this block to the very front of `expand_path`:\r\n```\r\n    if path.chars().count() < 1 {\r\n        return path.to_string();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change made the program exit cleanly when just invoking it with `cargo run`, but I'm not sure that this is the best solution.\r\n\r\nFinally, some of the `use`s have been reordered; my editor setup automatically runs `rustfmt`. I removed a lot of the things this changed to avoid noise, but left the `use` re-orders for lines where I added an import. I do recommend running `rustfmt` across your code automatically somehow, but I'll leave that up to you as the author.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/xylous/settle/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/xylous/settle/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
