This was overlooked before, as the relevant code to handle tuple-field assignments was not in the type checker either. To fix this I've merged the code that handles tuple field assignments and tuple field access (a normal a.b expression not in an LValue context) so that this will not happen again. I've also slightly improved the error message if a user accesses a tuple field that is out of bounds.\r\n\r\n## Dependency additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n## Test additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested the changes locally.\r\n- [x] I have formatted the changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and/or `cargo fmt` with default settings.\r\n- [x] I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this PR to the issue(s) that it resolves.\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the changes on GitHub, line by line.\r\n- [x] I have ensured all changes are covered in the description.\r\n\r\n## Documentation needs\r\n- [ ] This PR requires documentation updates when merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- If checked, list / describe what needs to be documented. -->\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\nBEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE\r\nfix: Fix parser error preventing assignments to tuple fields (#1318)\r\nEND_COMMIT_OVERRIDE", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1318/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1318/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1317", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1317/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1317/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1317/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1317", "id": 1700579252, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEPzTIc5QBIKY", "number": 1317, "title": "fix: Fix struct or tuple field assignment failing with generics", "user": {"login": "jfecher", "id": 13188781, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg4Nzgx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13188781?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher", "html_url": "https://github.com/jfecher", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-05-08T16:42:04Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-16T09:07:16Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-08T17:37:00Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/pulls/1317", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1317", "diff_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1317.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1317.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-08T17:37:00Z"}, "body": "# Related issue(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- If it does not already exist, first create a GitHub issue that describes the problem this Pull Request (PR) solves before creating the PR and link it here. -->\r\n\r\nResolves #1315 \r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\nFixes an issue where we forgot to call `.follow_bindings()` before matching on a type to see if it was a struct, tuple, or neither.

If all functions are successfully inlined, the fully-inlined main function is the new main function and all other functions are removed.\r\n\r\n## Dependency additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n## Test additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested the changes locally.\r\n- [x] I have formatted the changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and/or `cargo fmt` with default settings.\r\n- [x] I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this PR to the issue(s) that it resolves.\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the changes on GitHub, line by line.\r\n- [x] I have ensured all changes are covered in the description.\r\n\r\n## Documentation needs\r\n- [ ] This PR requires documentation updates when merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- If checked, list / describe what needs to be documented. -->\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1293/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1293/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1292", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1292/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1292/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1292/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1292", "id": 1696144421, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEPzTIc5PyPBU", "number": 1292, "title": "chore(parser): Parser error optimisation", "user": {"login": "joss-aztec", "id": 94053499, "node_id": "U_kgDOBZskew", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94053499?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec", "html_url": "https://github.com/joss-aztec", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joss-aztec/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-05-04T14:30:24Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-09T18:11:15Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-09T18:11:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/pulls/1292", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1292", "diff_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1292.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1292.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-09T18:11:13Z"}, "body": "# Related issue(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- If it does not already exist, first create a GitHub issue that describes the problem this Pull Request (PR) solves before creating the PR and link it here. -->\r\n\r\nResolves # <!-- link to issue -->\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\n~40% speed up in release mode\r\n~10% speed up in debug mode\r\n\r\nChumsky produces and aggregates large numbers of errors in normal operation regardless of whether it's on the happy path.

Abi encode public inputs\r\n2. Call `nargo::ops::verify_proof`\r\n3. Throw an error if the proof is invalid\r\n\r\nSteps 1 and 3 can instead be delegated to the caller, at which point they can just call `nargo::ops::verify_proof` themselves.\r\n\r\n## Dependency additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n## Test additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested the changes locally.\r\n- [x] I have formatted the changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and/or `cargo fmt` with default settings.\r\n- [ ] I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this PR to the issue(s) that it resolves.\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the changes on GitHub, line by line.\r\n- [x] I have ensured all changes are covered in the description.\r\n\r\n## Documentation needs\r\n- [ ] This PR requires documentation updates when merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- If checked, list / describe what needs to be documented. -->\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\nThis would also be required if we were to support performing actions against contract functions in nargo (as these are not represented as `CompiledProgram`s", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1269/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1269/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1266", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1266/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1266/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1266/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1266", "id": 1691446497, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEPzTIc5PiRIV", "number": 1266, "title": "chore: Replace explicit if-elses with `FieldElement::from<bool>()` for boolean fields", "user": {"login": "TomAFrench", "id": 15848336, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ4MzM2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15848336?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench", "html_url": "https://github.com/TomAFrench", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-05-01T21:41:58Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-02T16:01:39Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-02T16:01:38Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/pulls/1266", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1266", "diff_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1266.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1266.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-02T16:01:38Z"}, "body": "# Related issue(s)\r\n\r\nResolves #

<!-- link to issue -->\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\nFixes a couple bugs with mutable parameters:\r\n1. Mutable parameters were not being `Instruction::Load`'ed from automatically because they were not wrapped in `Value::Mutable`. This lead to a later panic in mutate_load_into_store.\r\n2. Because we evaluate lhs before rhs in `lhs = rhs;` we generate a load from lhs before we evaluate rhs and store to it. To create the store however, we replaced the load with a store previously, which would then create a `store` instruction storing rhs before rhs was even evaluated. So the IR would resemble `store v3 at v1; v3 = ...`. Since the store should be after everything else, I've replaced `mutate_load_into_store` with a new function to instead remove the old load and insert a new store at the end of the current block.\r\n3. Fixed a small issue where store instructions were being printed backwards.\r\n\r\n~~This PR depends on the previous fixes PR which is in the process of being merged.

The first was a simple oversight, and the second was because we created our FunctionBuilder object initialized to build the main function, but in calling `SharedContext::get_or_queue_function` with main's id to retrieve its translated ID, main was also queued to compile again, leaving us with 2 main functions. I've adjusted the flow here a bit to initialize FunctionBuilder to no function initially. The downside of this is that now `current_function` and `current_block` must be optional inside of it.\r\n\r\n## Dependency additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n## Test additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have tested the changes locally.\r\n- [ ] I have formatted the changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and/or `cargo fmt` with default settings.\r\n- [ ] I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this PR to the issue(s) that it resolves.\r\n- [ ] I have reviewed the changes on GitHub, line by line.\r\n- [ ] I have ensured all changes are covered in the description.\r\n\r\n## Documentation needs\r\n- [ ] This PR requires documentation updates when merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- If checked, list / describe what needs to be documented. -->\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1243/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1243/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1241", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1241/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1241/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1241/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1241", "id": 1687375744, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEPzTIc5PUyby", "number": 1241, "title": "chore(ssa refactor): Implement intrinsics", "user": {"login": "jfecher", "id": 13188781, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg4Nzgx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13188781?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher", "html_url": "https://github.com/jfecher", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-27T18:39:35Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-27T20:24:39Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-27T20:24:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/pulls/1241", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1241", "diff_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1241.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1241.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-27T20:24:38Z"}, "body": "# Related issue(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- If it does not already exist, first create a GitHub issue that describes the problem this Pull Request (PR) solves before creating the PR and link it here. -->\r\n\r\nResolves # <!-- link to issue -->\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\nImplements intrinsics into the ssa-gen pass of the new ssa IR.

This is because I ran into some difficulties thinking how the later model would interact with arrays. It also requires more upkeep, namely a variables map, most recent value in block map, sealing blocks, inserting block parameters of mutable variables on use, etc. Mutable variables may also require the arguments on `jmpif` that were discussed/removed in a previous PR (although in a different form - need different arguments for the then and else blocks).\r\n\r\nMy current thinking is that we can address this in a later PR.\r\n\r\n## Dependency additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n## Test additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have tested the changes locally.\r\n- [ ] I have formatted the changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and/or `cargo fmt` with default settings.\r\n- [ ] I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this PR to the issue(s) that it resolves.\r\n- [ ] I have reviewed the changes on GitHub, line by line.\r\n- [ ] I have ensured all changes are covered in the description.\r\n\r\n## Documentation needs\r\n- [ ] This PR requires documentation updates when merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- If checked, list / describe what needs to be documented. -->\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1234/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1234/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1233", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1233/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1233/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1233/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1233", "id": 1685303422, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEPzTIc5PNxyC", "number": 1233, "title": "chore(ssa refactor): Implement for loops", "user": {"login": "jfecher", "id": 13188781, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg4Nzgx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13188781?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher", "html_url": "https://github.com/jfecher", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfecher/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-26T15:59:07Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-26T19:57:04Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-26T19:57:02Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/pulls/1233", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1233", "diff_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1233.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1233.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-26T19:57:02Z"}, "body": "# Related issue(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- If it does not already exist, first create a GitHub issue that describes the problem this Pull Request (PR) solves before creating the PR and link it here. -->\r\n\r\nResolves #

These hash functions agree with those used by Circom.

This change allows the previous release to be marked as \"latest\" until we manually update the GitHub Release to be latest (such as when documentation is done).\r\n\r\nNote: In the PR that [added this feature](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/pull/1181) on Release-Please, they restricted it to 0.x.x versions, which would not work for our workflow after 1.0; however, I think this decision was arbitrary and I'll work with them to allow this to be applied to any release versions.\r\n\r\n## Dependency additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n## Test additions / changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested the changes locally.\r\n- [x] I have formatted the changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and/or `cargo fmt` with default settings.\r\n- [ ] I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this PR to the issue(s) that it resolves.\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the changes on GitHub, line by line.\r\n- [x] I have ensured all changes are covered in the description.\r\n\r\n## Documentation needs\r\n- [ ] This PR requires documentation updates when merged.\r\n\r\n<!-- If checked, list / describe what needs to be documented. -->\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1152/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1152/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1151", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1151/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1151/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/issues/1151/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1151", "id": 1668129775, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEPzTIc5OUiJ-", "number": 1151, "title": "chore!: remove outdated arkworks backend", "user": {"login": "TomAFrench", "id": 15848336, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ4MzM2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15848336?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench", "html_url": "https://github.com/TomAFrench", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomAFrench/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-14T12:04:55Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-14T15:52:46Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-14T15:52:45Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/noir-lang/noir/pulls/1151", "html_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1151", "diff_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1151.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/pull/1151.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-14T15:52:45Z"}, "body": "# Related issue(s)\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/noir-lang/marlin_arkworks_backend/issues/8\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\nI've removed the marlin backend it's using an extremely outdated interface and pulling in a version of ACVM which is multiple breaking releases behind.

This means that we don't need to be concerned about the keys and the acir being in sync as they're stored together.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that we now need to load the proving key when verifying a proof however my preference for solving this is to derive specialized \"verifier artifacts\" which just contain the information required for verifying the circuit. Nargo would then accept the full or verifier artifact when verifying a circuit but that's OOS for this PR.\r\n\r\nNote: `PreprocessedContract` does NOT match the desired spec for A3 contracts, these can be derived from this artifact however. I don't think that Nargo is the right place for performing this translation so the A3 team may need to maintain a small tool to translate between them.
