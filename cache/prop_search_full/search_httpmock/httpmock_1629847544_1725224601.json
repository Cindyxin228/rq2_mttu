client altogether. This not only addresses the TLS issues but also reduces the dependency tree by approximately 60 crates! \r\n\r\nSome users reported they also use httpmock as a standalone mock server behind proxies and other infrastructure (like Kubernetes), which may be SSL-enabled. This still requires a real HTTP client i.m.o. For this scenario, I want to hold off until the isahc upstream PR gets merged, as my experience with isahc has been very positive so far. However, to opt into using isahc, users need to enable the \u201cremote\u201d feature flag, which will only be used to connect to remote mock servers. As a consequence, functions like MockServer::connect, MockServer::connect_async, and MockServer::connect_env will only be available when the \u201cremote\u201d feature is turned on. \r\n\r\nThis
