3.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst\">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3.2 - 2020-10-25</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **SECURITY ISSUE:** Attempted to make RSA PKCS#1v1.5 decryption more constant\n  time, to protect against Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities. Due to limitations\n  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a\n  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to\n  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for\n  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*\n* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL\n  will need to upgrade.\n* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.\n<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>\n<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with\nOpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v3-1:</p>\n<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based\n  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally\n  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.\n* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by\n  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support\n  for it.\n* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will\n  be removed in the next release.\n* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the\n  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.\n* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  and\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  .\n* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``\n  longer than 2\\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This\n  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.\n<p>.. _v3-0:</p>\n<p>3.0 - 2020-07-20\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
