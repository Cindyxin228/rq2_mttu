Though, one little thing I noticed while looking through the code was that the sphere-ray intersection could be simplified.\r\n\r\nSince `b` is always multiplied by 2, it can actually be omitted if the multiplication of `d` by 4 is removed, as well as the `2.0` factor in division of `t_plus` and `t_minus`.\r\n\r\nI linked a more thorough explanation of this below, from Peter Shirley's RTIOW. Although, you may want to keep it the way it is as it might be clearer \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nReference: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#surfacenormalsandmultipleobjects/simplifyingtheray-sphereintersectioncode", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekzhang/rpt/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekzhang/rpt/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
