Here is a brief overview\r\n\r\n\r\n- default for using block requests is 1024. This can be explicitly increased by the user to whatever value that want (will look for nearest power of 2 using coap-lite) using `set_block1_size`.\r\n- client requests will now use block1 option by default if they are large -> is this a good idea?\r\n- added a small test to make sure the client / server are both able to use the block1 option\r\n\r\nstill missing:\r\n- no negotiation for block size is being done right now\r\n- is there a `rustfmt.toml` for the repository so I don't reformat a bunch of code in the PR?\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
