This fixes an issue when a Firestore document contains a map value but has no fields (i.e. `{}`).\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\nThis fixes a deserialization error caused when trying to fulfill the properties defined in `dto::Document`. The fix is relatively simply, this modifies the `dto::MapValue` type to allow for `Option<HashMap<String, Value>>` instead of `HashMap<String,Value>`. In this way we allow for the optional presence of these values.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR includes unit tests for `dto::Document` to assert that it deserializes correctly when empty `map` is returned.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/davidgraeff/firestore-db-and-auth-rs/issues/17/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/davidgraeff/firestore-db-and-auth-rs/issues/17/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
