available for ipfs-embed users, such as actyx.\r\n\r\nThe concrete use case is to be able to add all blocks of a fast path update in a single transaction, or to be able to do a banyan rewrite fully in memory and only spill over to disk once the memory level is exceeded or the write is done.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no overhead by opening transactions. sqlite opens a transaction anyway, and in the block store all ops are implemented with a single statement transaction as well.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this is WIP until there are tests, but I want to know what you think of the approach", "reactions":
