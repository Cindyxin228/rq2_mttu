I'm discovering netsim-embed (after noticing it exists from the netsim crate issue tracker and having failed to use netsim that requires a too-old version of libc), and it looks awesome :D\r\n\r\nI've just hit a problem that could be easily fixed in netsim-embed, by taking FnOnce instead of Fn. Unless there's some spooky action-at-a-distance unsafe code, this change should be legitimate, and makes programming much easier by not requiring arcs and clones everywhere.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about that change? :)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ipfs-rust/netsim-embed/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ipfs-rust/netsim-embed/issues/4/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
