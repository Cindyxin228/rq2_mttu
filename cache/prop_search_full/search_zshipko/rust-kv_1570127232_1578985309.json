It appears that the `failure` library was not implementing it.\r\n\r\nAs such, I replaced `failure` with `thiserror` (written by the author of `anyhow` to provide library authors that want to have their own errors a derive macro), and found that I could now use the `?` operator against the Results returned from `kv`.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this pull-request, as having the ability to use the `?` operator, while still using libraries which expect the Err portion to implement std::error::Error, appears to be more inline with direction that Rust error-handling is evolving.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zshipko/rust-kv/issues/9/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zshipko/rust-kv/issues/9/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
