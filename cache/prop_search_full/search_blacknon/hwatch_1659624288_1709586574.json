I often find myself using hwatch to ping a server every few seconds to find differences. Then I feel guilty for hitting the server too much and restart the command with a higher interval. But that also means I lose the history of the previous commands. I wondered what it would be like to have the interval be a runtime variable that could be updated.\r\n\r\nThis PR turns the const DEFAULT_INTERVAL (or passed in cli argument \"interval\") into the Arc (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html) Interval. I made it a new type for ease of use, then we can just clone it and share the reference by multiple places throughout the code. In particular, \r\n\r\n**main.rs** -> This has the update thread time. Each loop it rereads the current global Interval and starts a new timer\r\n**view.rs** -> This is what builds the App, so I passed it along\r\n**app.rs** -> This is where the interval can be increased and decreased\r\n**headers.rs** -> This draws the number to the screen, so it just has a f64, but has been updated from pointing directly at DEFAULT_INTERVAL\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes are docs and clippy errors. (I noticed `n` for  toggling line numbers was missing from the help menu, so I added that, too)\r\n\r\nHappy to update things if you see a cleaner pattern but still want to accept the PR in some fashion.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBrian\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/blacknon/hwatch/issues/90/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":
