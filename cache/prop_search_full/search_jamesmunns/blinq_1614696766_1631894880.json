Additionally, `heapless` Queues store `N - 1` elements, so the element count for blinq queues has to be increased by 1 for now, as const generic arithmetic is not supported yet. I have added clarifying comments regarding that to the usage examples.\r\n\r\nIt could make sense to wait with this upgrade until full-fledged const generics are released, but I figured I'd put up this PR for good measure since it is a good feature to have.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmunns/blinq/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmunns/blinq/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
