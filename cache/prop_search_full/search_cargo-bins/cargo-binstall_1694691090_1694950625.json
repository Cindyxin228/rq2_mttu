applied: https://github.com/GNQG/cargo-binstall/commit/cb40519ff6e02e624abb25491b0f86ccb829e478\r\nFixes #1339\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\nBy default, `trust-dns` loops through all available interfaces and tries to use them, but when you have applications installed such as VMware or VirtualBox, it creates interfaces that resolve to the loopback address. Given that `trust-dns` has a timeout of 5s and then retries many times, it becomes really slow. This PR adds a custom DNS resolver struct that instructs `trust-dns` to only query the default network interface (which is either \"WiFi\" or \"Ethernet\", most of the time).", "reactions": {"url":
