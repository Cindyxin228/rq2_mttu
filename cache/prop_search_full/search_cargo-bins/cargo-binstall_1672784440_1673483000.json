notes into the section below:_\r\n\r\n<!-- do not change or remove this heading -->\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\n_Binstall is a tool to fetch and install Rust-based executables as binaries. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for `cargo install` in most cases. Install it today with `cargo install cargo-binstall`, from the binaries below, or if you already have it, upgrade with `cargo binstall cargo-binstall`._\r\n\r\n#### In this release:\r\n\r\n- Quickinstall has moved to this (cargo-bins) organisation! ([quickinstall#104](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-quickinstall/issues/104), #638)\r\n- Platform detection improvements:\r\n  - Avoid invalid target triples from some configurations of rustc (#637)\r\n  - Linux: use runtime detection of architecture and libc variant when rustc isn't present (#649)\r\n  - Android: allow fallback to musl libc targets (#649)\r\n\r\n#### Other changes:\r\n\r\n- Fix: Avoid race condition when updating `$CARGO_HOME/.crates.toml` (#588, #645, #643)\r\n- Fix: Create `$CARGO_HOME/.crates.toml` if it doesn't exist instead of failing (#621, #622)\r\n- Fix: Make sure all `cargo` subprocesses are also terminated when cargo-binstall is interrupted (#619)\r\n- Fix: Print resolutions without interleaving (#619)\r\n- Fix: Installing crates previously removed cargo-uninstall now works correctly (#625, #628)\r\n- Various improvements to CI (#630, #660, #668, #675, #676)\r\n- Various optimisations (#610, #619, #643, #644, #653, #655, #656, #667)\r\n- The release artifacts now includes an additional \"full\" build that includes debuginfo in split format (#660, #672)", "reactions": {"url":
