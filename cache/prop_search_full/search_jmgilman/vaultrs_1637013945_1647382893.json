I think adding something like \"httpmock\" to you dockertest-server repository could do the trick? Perhaps, except that Vault requires TLS-connections to the APIserver, so it would require a TLS-proxy container as well, or a specialized docker image for handling all of the above.\r\n\r\ntldr, it was too much work for me to find a fitting solution for this at the moment.
