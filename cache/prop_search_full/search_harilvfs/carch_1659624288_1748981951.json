in different lang as the docs site has, but I feel much much difficult to maintain README file in different lang. As I am very happy that docs are in different lang and always they will. But in case of README, there is not many more I have put in README, so I am taking down the README that are in other lang except the main one.\r\n\r\nYeah the docs will remain in different lang, that is necessary there and I don't have to change the docs every time, so the maintain time there will be much less than here.\r\n\r\nSo remove those lang README and I have bit redone the README part for more practical review.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [ ] Updates <!-- Added/updated scripts or configurations or others -->\r\n- [ ] Remove <!-- Bad Script/Code or others-->\r\n- [ ] Fixed

3.20.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">tempfile's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.20.0</h2>\n<p>This release mostly unifies the behavior/capabilities around &quot;keeping&quot; temporary files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename <code>Builder::keep(bool)</code> (via deprecation) to <code>Builder::disable_cleanup(bool)</code> to make it clear that behaves differently from <code>NamedTempFile::keep()</code>. The former disables automatic cleanup while the latter <em>consumes</em> the <code>NamedTempFile</code> object entirely and unsets the &quot;temporary file&quot; attribute (on Windows).</li>\n<li>Rename <code>TempDir::into_path</code> (via deprecation) to <code>TempDir::keep</code> to mirror <code>NamedTempFile::keep</code>.</li>\n<li>Add <code>TempDir::disable_cleanup</code>, <code>NamedTempFile::disable_cleanup</code>, and <code>TempPath::disable_cleanup</code> making it possible to disable automatic cleanup in-place <em>after</em> creating a temporary file/directory (equivalent to calling <code>Builder::disable_cleanup</code> before creating the file/directory).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, it adds a few spooled temporary file features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>SpooledTempFile::into_file</code> for turning a <code>SpooledTempFile</code> into a regular unnamed temporary file, writing it to the backing storage (&quot;rolling&quot; it) if it was still stored in-memory.</li>\n<li>Add <code>spooled_tempfile_in</code> and <code>SpooledTempFile::new_in</code> methods for creating spooled temporary files in a specific directory. This makes it possible to choose the backing device for your spooled temporary file which is rather important on Linux where the default temporary directory is likely backed by memory (defeating the entire point of having a spooled temporary file).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, this release improves documentation, especially the top-level documentation explaining which temporary file type to use.</p>\n<p><strong>BREAKING</strong> for those with <code>deny(warnings)</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Builder::keep</code> deprecated in favor of <code>Builder::disable_cleanup</code>.</li>\n<li><code>TempDir::into_path</code> is deprecated in favor of <code>TempDir::keep</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BREAKING</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/99ffea61ade621161db326b6745c7b36a90ddbd0\"><code>99ffea6</code></a> chore: release v3.20.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/358\">#358</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/bd2b2674423ae6598070fab30e6627810ac282a9\"><code>bd2b267</code></a> feat: make it possible to disable cleanup in-place after creation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/355\">#355</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/3b30099abd7585a9b6600276f6dcdfa557e88f19\"><code>3b30099</code></a> ci: really check docs for warnings (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/357\">#357</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/f701f5245624b8cfcd782dfd62fcfe86d35c173b\"><code>f701f52</code></a> ci: check docs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/356\">#356</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/d34afe99fd93bb13253128cc58dfc4032edfa5a5\"><code>d34afe9</code></a> doc: improve SpooledData documentation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/6deb42e04ceb2f2c306510b1605d9548e77868e5\"><code>6deb42e</code></a> doc: make it easier to pick the correct tempfile constructor/type</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/e284782c6c1c2f565af2ab9b5c0be9f9c5ed3607\"><code>e284782</code></a> feat: allow creating spooled temporary files in a specific directory (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/353\">#353</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/07edc310a5c8725346cd2bb2a5d065ff298f4fa0\"><code>07edc31</code></a> feat: implement <code>SpooledTempFile::into_file</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/352\">#352</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/b1223553bb888e35bab7675fbac235e4be6eaf7e\"><code>b122355</code></a> fix: add must_use attribute to TempDir::keep (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/351\">#351</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commit/cbd1e976e106d4a12432e124494f735bf40eafe2\"><code>cbd1e97</code></a> feat: rename <code>TempDir::into_path</code> to <code>TempDir::keep</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/349\">#349</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/compare/v3.19.1...v3.20.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=tempfile&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=3.19.1&new-version=3.20.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Linux. However, two separate scripts are needed since the installation process differs between the two distributions. To simplify and unify the installation process for users, we are now fully relying on the Cargo crate of Carch. This makes it easier to install Carch on both distributions without any additional scripts.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [x] Updates <!-- Added/updated scripts or configurations or others -->\r\n- [ ]

beginning of the Carch for everything in the menu as well as commands. But since Bash script may become slow as I consider this as a coding language, not a programming language. And for the best, I have rewritten everything of Carch in Rust\u2014not the scripts of Carch, but the main Carch script now completely has been in Rust.\r\n\r\nYeah, it improved performance much before, and many things have been removed and many things have been added. The all detail will come in the coming release changelog.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the steps you followed to test the changes. If applicable, mention the specific environment where the testing took place. -->\r\n- [x] Tested on Arch Linux/Based Distro.\r\n- [x] Tested on Fedora Linux.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease ensure
