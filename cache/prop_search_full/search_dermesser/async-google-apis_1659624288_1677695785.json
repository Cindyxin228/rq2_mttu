Thanks for this crate, it\u2019s a huge help!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve bumped some dependencies a little bit to avoid this security vulnerability that was coming from the time crate: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0071\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n- Turned off default features on chrono since they use time\r\n- Bumped hyper-rustls to 0.23 (worth noting that bumping this version up more will probably require additional changes as well)\r\n- Bumped tokio to 1.25\r\n- Bumped yup-oauth2 to 6.5, since there also seemed to be a time dependency there\r\n- Bumped hyper to 0.14\r\n- Modified some example code in the example crates + manual demo to get stuff to compile with sensible replacements needed for the newer version of hyper_rustls \u2014 changed `hyper_rustls::HttpsConnector::new();` to `hyper_rustls::HttpsConnectorBuilder::new().with_native_roots().https_or_http().enable_http2().build();` \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve integrated the version bumps in our own codebase and everything seems to work, but not sure if anything here might impact other uses of this crate. Let me know if you have any input and I\u2019m happy to modify as well!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSophia", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dermesser/async-google-apis/issues/20/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dermesser/async-google-apis/issues/20/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
