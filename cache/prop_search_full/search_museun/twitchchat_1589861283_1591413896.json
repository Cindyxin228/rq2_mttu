(AsyncRead+AsyncWrite, etc) or an error.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this type should have helper methods for doing stuff like `twitchchat::tokio::native_tls::connect -> Connector`.\r\n\r\nAlso, `run` was renamed to `run_to_completion` to make the name more obvious. It takes the runner but `&mut self` so `async move { }` blocks are now required.\r\n\r\nA run_with_retry was added, which is like `run_to_completion` but takes in an `fn async fn(Result<Status,Error>) -> Result<bool, Error>` which is used as the ___retry strategy___.\r\n\r\nThe `new` method on the `Runner` was renamed to default the rate limiter. A `new_with_rate_limit` and `new_without_rate_limit` were also added to do the obvious.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/museun/twitchchat/issues/129/reactions", "total_count": 0,
