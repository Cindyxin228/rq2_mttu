While replacing TOML with YAML completely on the master branch would probably be a very bad idea, adding it as a compilation option while leaving TOML as the default seems to be a win-win, and will not break compatibility with dependants' config files, (being opt in).\r\n\r\nThis implementation creates a couple new errors for YAML types with a different name than TOML errors, since renaming TOML errors to a generic name would be a breaking change.  However, perhaps next major version bump, `BadTomlData` and `BadYamlData` could be merged into `DeserializeError` or something similar, while `SerializeTomlError` and `SerializeYamlError` could be merged into something like `SerializeError`.  This would make someone who already uses TOML's transition to YAML easier, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis implementation also doesn't tolerate having both TOML and YAML, or neither TOML and YAML enabled at once.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/issues/17/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/issues/17/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/issues/16", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/issues/16/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/issues/16/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/issues/16/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-cli/confy/pull/16", "id": 476490313, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzA0MDI2MTEw", "number": 16, "title": "Allow saving and loading to a specified path", "user": {"login": "alch-emi", "id": 38897201, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODk3MjAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38897201?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi", "html_url": "https://github.com/alch-emi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alch-emi/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2019-08-03T21:18:24Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-27T21:41:41Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-13T12:49:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-cli/confy/pulls/16", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-cli/confy/pull/16", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-cli/confy/pull/16.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-cli/confy/pull/16.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-13T12:49:53Z"}, "body": "Currently, the user has no control over where their config file is created.
