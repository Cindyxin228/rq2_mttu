now enforces valid package names when running `leo init` and `leo new`. In addition, we now will output the number of constraints during `leo build` by default. Adds CircleCI to resolve our flaky test issues from Github Actions.\r\n\r\n- Adds safety check for valid package names\r\n- Removes use of 'Default' in Leo CLI\r\n- Renames `leo update` command's  `Sub` to `Automatic`\r\n- Renames all instances of `ctx` to `context`\r\n- Outputs the number of constraints during `leo build`\r\n- Resolves flaky tests from Github Actions\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdds unit tests to check package validity.\r\n```rust\r\n#[test]\r\nfn test_is_package_name_valid() {\r\n    assert!(Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo\"));\r\n    assert!(Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo-bar\"));\r\n    assert!(Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo-bar-baz\"));\r\n\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"-\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"-foo\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"-foo-\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo--bar\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo---bar\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo--bar--baz\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo---bar---baz\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo*bar\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo,bar\"));\r\n    assert!(!Package::is_package_name_valid(\"foo_bar\"));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs part of migrating to CircleCI, we are now compiling the local version of Leo once, and running it on all of the end-to-end tests in parallel, saving time and resources.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-02-24 at 11 19 00
