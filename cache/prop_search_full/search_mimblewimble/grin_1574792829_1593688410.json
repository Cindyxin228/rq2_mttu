PMMR (in the case where it was missing from the db after migration to 3.x.x).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to ensure the inverse of this - that the header PMMR is consistent with header_head from the db in the case where the header PMMR contains unwanted rightmost data.\r\nThe PMMR is append-only and there may be headers appended that we want to discard.\r\nThe `header_head` in the db is our \"source of truth\".\r\n\r\nWe simply (re)set the PMMR handle `last_pos` to discard data to the right.\r\nThen we can safely \"rewind\" the header PMMR to the pos corresponding `header_head` from db.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso tweaked the order of operations slightly when processing block headers.\r\nWe now validate the header _before_ applying it to our header PMMR (to validate the roots).\r\nOtherwise we potentially leave the header PMMR in a bad state if the roots are valid but the header ends up being invalid for some other reason.\r\nThis is likely the reason _why_ a node gets into a bad state. We can now recover from this on startup but we want to avoid it happening in the first place.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTested with sync (and staying in sync) on both `floonet` and `mainnet`.\r\nTested mining on `usertesting`.\r\n@quentinlesceller tested this against `floonet` with stratum miners.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3362/reactions",

in stratumserver and log.\r\nIn servers/src/mining/stratumserver.rs\r\n`add_worker()` calls `stratum_stats.write()` before `workers_list.write()`\r\nhttps://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/c7c9a32b9b85b9e7dce3b254600972dcc6d7f683/servers/src/mining/stratumserver.rs#L700-L704\r\n`remove_worker()` calls `workers_list.read()` before `stratum_stats.write()`\r\nhttps://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/c7c9a32b9b85b9e7dce3b254600972dcc6d7f683/servers/src/mining/stratumserver.rs#L721\r\nWhen `add_worker()` and `remove_worker()` are called simultaneously, the following deadlock may happen:\r\n\r\n|Thread-A|Thread-B|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|A.lock()||\r\n||B.lock()|\r\n|B.lock()//deadlock!||\r\n||A.lock()//deadlock!|\r\n\r\nSimilarly, \r\n`init_logger()` calls `LOGGING_CONFIG.lock()` before `WAS_INIT.lock()`\r\nhttps://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/c7c9a32b9b85b9e7dce3b254600972dcc6d7f683/util/src/logger.rs#L154\r\nhttps://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/c7c9a32b9b85b9e7dce3b254600972dcc6d7f683/util/src/logger.rs#L253\r\n`init_test_logger()` calls `WAS_INIT.lock()` before `LOGGING_CONFIG.lock()`\r\nhttps://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/c7c9a32b9b85b9e7dce3b254600972dcc6d7f683/util/src/logger.rs#L261-L262\r\nhttps://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/c7c9a32b9b85b9e7dce3b254600972dcc6d7f683/util/src/logger.rs#L271\r\n\r\n* How I fix:\r\nThe fix is to enforce the order of the locks.\r\n\r\nIn stratumserver.rs, I use only one write lock of `workers_list` and remove the following read lock. This is to avoid possible atomicity violation when `workers_list` is written by another thread before being read.\r\nIn logger.rs, `WAS_INIT` is lifted before `LOGGING_CONFIG` in `remove_worker` to prevent the interleaving of `init_logger()` and `init_test_logger()`.\r\nNote that dropping the lockguard of Lock-A before calling Lock-B is also a possible solution for conflicting lock order. But I did not use it here to prevent possible atomicity violation.\r\n\r\n* Minor suggestion:\r\nWhen the critical sections of different locks may overlap, I suggest always locking in the order that they are declared to prevent such deadlocks.\r\n\r\nThere is only one thing that concerns me: \r\nfn `remove_worker()` calls `update_stats()` where `stratum_stats.write()` is called. Then `stratum_stats.write()` is called again. Is it okay to have the two critical sections interleaved with `remove_worker()` or `add_worker()` from another thread?\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

HardFork3\r\nabout: This hard-fork allows blocks with 3\\*HARD_FORK_INTERVAL/FLOONET_THIRD_HARD_FORK <= height < 4\\*HARD_FORK_INTERVAL with header version 4 and Cuckarooz29 as secondary PoW.\r\ntitle: HardFork3\r\nlabels: consensus breaking\r\nassignees: @antiochp @yeastplume @quentinlesceller\r\n\r\nCurrently, consensus::valid_header_version(height, version) returns false for all height >= 3\\*HARD_FORK_INTERVAL.\r\nThis PR changes that to return true for version 4 at either FLOONET_THIRD_HARD_FORK <= height < 4\\*HARD_FORK_INTERVAL on floonet or 3\\*HARD_FORK_INTERVAL <= height < 4\\*HARD_FORK_INTERVAL on mainnet.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes global::create_pow_context to return new_cuckarooz_ctx(edge_bits, proof_size) when consensus::valid_header_version(height, version) holds for version 4, which means that Cuckarooz29 [1] is the only valid secondary PoW after the hard fork.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested on a mainnet fast sync.\r\n\r\n[1]

* __not used in tests__\r\n* thread local CHAIN_TYPE \r\n  * \"inherits\" GLOBAL_CHAIN_TYPE in threads via thread local\r\n  * must be explicitly set on a per-test basis\r\n\r\nReads via `get_chain_type()` always go via the thread local `CHAIN_TYPE`. \r\nThis will be lazily initialized based on `GLOBAL_CHAIN_TYPE` is not explicitly set.\r\n\r\n* introduced `init_global_chain_type()` to be called (once) during node startup\r\n  * this uses our `OneTime` util internally\r\n* `get_chain_type()` reads the thread local, lazily inits it from global chain type\r\n* renamed `set_mining_mode()` to `set_local_chain_type()`\r\n  * tests are free to call `set_local_chain_type()` within the context of a single test thread\r\n  * tests must explicitly call this and we panic with a useful msg if not set\r\n* cleaned up `POW_CONTEXT_TYPE` and `PowContextType` (seemingly unused)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n- [x] corresponding changes in grin-wallet (`set_mining_mode()`

processing we `check_known` and halt processing if the block is \"already known\".\r\nThis avoids wasting resources reprocessing blocks from the network.\r\n\r\nWe treat a block as known if it matches the current chain head (reprocessing a recent block) or if the full block already exists in the local db (reprocessing a historical block).\r\n\r\nWith the work on \"checkpoints\" in #3266 there is another case to consider - one of \"future blocks\". If the chain head is reset or reverted to an earlier block (for _any_ reason) the current block processing refuses to (re)process blocks that are \"already known\". \r\n\r\nWe can get into tricky situations where the chain head will refuse to progress because we incorrectly believe a block is \"known\" yet not actually on the current chain.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `check_known` take `total_difficulty` into account when comparing blocks against current chain head. If the block would increase total difficulty then we want to treat it as \"unknown\" regardless of local db.\r\n\r\nThis makes is significantly easier to reset the chain head and still have block processing pipeline work correctly for reprocessing subsequent blocks.\r\n\r\nNote: This _only_ applies in situations where the chain head is explicitly reset. Under normal block processing the chain head only ever progresses in one direction, with total difficulty strictly increasing.\r\n\r\nAdded test coverage to demonstrate \"forgetting\" about an \"already known\" block, based on total difficulty relative to chain head.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3298/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3298/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3297", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3297/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3297/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3297/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3297", "id": 601443113, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDA0NzA0NjAy", "number": 3297, "title": "Refactor SyncState", "user": {"login": "hashmap", "id": 417244, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzI0NA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/417244?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashmap", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hashmap/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 465821397, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw0NjU4MjEzOTc=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "9eebcf", "default": true, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-04-16T20:33:52Z", "updated_at": "2020-04-20T10:30:09Z", "closed_at": "2020-04-20T10:30:04Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/pulls/3297", "html_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3297", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3297.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3297.patch", "merged_at": "2020-04-20T10:30:04Z"}, "body": "Method `sync_error()` return type was simplified.\r\n`update_txhashset_download()` was  made type safe, which eliminates a runtime enum variant's  check.

`header_head` handling and maintains the `header_head` in the db.\r\n\r\nWe changed the way we handle the `header_head` in #3045. We used to maintain the header_head in the db and that PR changed it to simply read the head of the header MMR from the header MMR files directly.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change was to reduce the number of things we need to keep consistent (MMR file + db index).\r\n\r\nI'm now convinced this was a bad choice and the wrong direction to go in.\r\n\r\nThe RwLock around the header MMR means we cannot read the current head without taking a read lock and this blocks if anything (block processing, header processing, sync process) currently has a write lock on the MMR.\r\n\r\nThis necessitated the whole `try_header_head()` timeout based workaround.\r\n\r\nThe fact that writing the `header_head` to the db is transactional is actually beneficial here - \r\n* we can read from the db regardless of what other threads are doing\r\n* once the header_head is committed to the db we know this is good (and we are not at risk of reading inconsistent state from the non-transactional MMR files)\r\n\r\nSo being forced to keep the MMR and the db \"in sync\" and consistent is a _good thing_. The transactional semantics of the db means we only update the `header_head` once we commit the db transaction, vs the MMR backend files that can (and will) be inconsistent at times.\r\n\r\nIn concrete terms this will get rid of the large volume of \"failed to obtain lock for try_header_head\" errors during fast sync.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3268/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3268/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3265", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3265/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3265/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3265/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3265", "id": 578161514, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1NzkzOTI2", "number": 3265, "title": "cleanup util::from_hex()", "user": {"login": "antiochp", "id": 30642645, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQyNjQ1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30642645?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp", "html_url": "https://github.com/antiochp", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antiochp/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 465821397, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw0NjU4MjEzOTc=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "9eebcf", "default": true, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-03-09T20:10:58Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-10T10:36:26Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-10T10:36:19Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/pulls/3265", "html_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3265", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3265.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3265.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-10T10:36:19Z"}, "body": "~Our original implementation panic'd if the hex string was an odd number of characters.\r\nThis is bad as we use `from_hex()` when parsing various external ids and hashes.~\r\n\r\nEdit: We prevented the panic via the janky QQQ parse code (see below).

#3235.\r\nExtracted the \"undo list\" concept from the kernel index exploration (#3228) and took advantage of it for outputs (where undo == unspend during rewind).\r\n\r\nThis allows the `output_pos` index (quick lookup of output pos by output commitment) to more closely track the current utxo set in a transactional manner.\r\nWe now keep the `output_pos` index updated when applying new blocks _and_ when rewinding existing blocks under a fork scenario.\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the edge-case of needing to account for \"false positive\" results in the index.\r\nWe still do not treat the `output_pos` as authoritative but there are currently believed to be no cases where it will temporarily diverge from the set of unspent output pos.\r\n\r\nWe rebuild (via optimized `init`) the output_pos_index on - \r\n  1. startup, to ensure the node starts up in a consistent state\r\n  1. compact (once outputs are removed and pruned/compacted we no longer need to keep them in the index)\r\n  1. during fast sync, after receiving txhashset from a peer\r\n\r\nWe log discrepencies between the index and set of outputs during index rebuild.\r\nThis should give us some insight into whether our assumptions are correct here.\r\nIf we are comfortable that we can begin treating this index as authoritative then we will only need to rebuild the index on sync (3) above.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a relatively large change in terms of code changes. But conceptually it is pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\n* Update `output_pos` index when we call `apply_block()`\r\n  * add new index entries for new outputs\r\n  * remove index entries for spent outputs\r\n* Update `output_pos` on rewind (per block)\r\n  * remove \"future\" outputs that no longer exist\r\n  * re-add \"unspent\" entries to the index based on per-block \"spent_index\" (aka undo list)\r\n* Store a spent_index per block when we store the associated block in the db \r\n\r\nWe used to do something similar but not exactly the same - \r\n* we stored a bitmap of spent pos per block\r\n  * this allowed us to rewind the utxo set itself, but not the associated index\r\n* we did not undo these in the index itself when rewinding\r\n  * this led to false positives when reading the index, so we always went to the PMMR to corroborate what the index said (if index was inconsistent with PMMR then treat as spent)\r\n\r\nThe majority of the code change involves breaking the `rewind` functionality out to do it per iteratively block. Before we could simply take the union of all the per-block bitmaps. This has been reworked to rewind block by block to take advantage of our ability to rewind the index itself.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe were originally hoping to get the `kernel_index` impl into `3.1.0` but this was not possible given the timing of the `3.1.0` release. This PR gives us a way of confirming the approach works on the existing `output_pos` index.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3236/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3236/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3234", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3234/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3234/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3234/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3234", "id": 567499516, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzc3MTExODg1", "number": 3234, "title": "[Docs] Rangeproof output documentation", "user": {"login": "jafalter", "id": 7274756, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzQ3NTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7274756?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter", "html_url": "https://github.com/jafalter", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jafalter/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-02-19T11:20:43Z", "updated_at": "2020-02-25T17:20:56Z", "closed_at": "2020-02-25T17:20:56Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mimblewimble/grin/pulls/3234", "html_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3234", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3234.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3234.patch", "merged_at": "2020-02-25T17:20:56Z"}, "body": "---\r\nname: PR Rangeproof documentation\r\nabout: Bulletproofs output bytes\r\ntitle: '[Docs] Rangeproof output documentation'\r\nlabels: ''\r\nassignees: ''\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis PR adds an additional documentation document, explaining how to recover the parameters of a range proof used in Grin output, from the byte output.
