This is a very useful thing to have.\r\n\r\nWe use the `error-trace` library, which provides backtraces for where\r\nthe original error occurred.  We wanted to pass these backtraces to\r\n`rollbar`.  But to do this, we needed to call `with_frame` in a loop,\r\nand this failed as follows:\r\n\r\n    error[E0499]: cannot borrow `err_builder` as mutable more than once at a time\r\n       --> src/errors.rs:160:21\r\n        |\r\n    160 |                     err_builder.with_frame(fb.build());\r\n        |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        |                     |\r\n        |                     second mutable borrow occurs here\r\n        |                     first mutable borrow occurs here\r\n    ...\r\n    166 |     }\r\n        |     - first borrow ends here\r\n\r\n    error[E0499]: cannot borrow `err_builder` as mutable more than once at a time\r\n       --> src/errors.rs:164:9\r\n        |\r\n    160 |                     err_builder.with_frame(fb.build());\r\n        |                     ----------- first mutable borrow occurs here\r\n    ...\r\n    164 |         err_builder.send();\r\n        |         ^^^^^^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here\r\n    165 |         Ok(())\r\n    166 |     }\r\n        |     - first borrow ends here\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs because of a subtle lifetime issue in the function\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n    impl<'a> ReportErrorBuilder<'a> {\r\n        // ...\r\n        pub fn with_frame(&'a mut self, frame_builder: FrameBuilder) -> &'a mut Self {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere, `Self` refers to the type `ReportErrorBuilder<'a>`, which contains\r\nthe lifetime `'a`.  But the the `with_frame` function uses a mutable\r\nreference `&'a mut self`, which also includes `'a`. This says that the\r\n_reference_ to `ReportErrorBuilder` has the same lifetime as the\r\n`ReportErrorBuilder` itself, which makes it impossible to use the\r\nfunction anywhere except in a \"fluent\" call chain:\r\n\r\n    let payload = client.build_report()\r\n        .from_error_message(&e)\r\n        .with_level(Level::WARNING)\r\n        .with_frame(FrameBuilder::new()\r\n                    .with_column_number(42)\r\n                    .build())\r\n        .with_frame(FrameBuilder::new()\r\n                    .with_column_number(24)\r\n                    .build())\r\n        .with_title(\"w\")\r\n        .to_string();\r\n\r\nBut if we change the signature to:\r\n\r\n    pub fn with_frame(&mut self, frame_builder: FrameBuilder) -> &mut Self {\r\n\r\n...then Rust will automatically generate a new lifetime (call it `'b`)\r\nfor the `&mut` reference.  This will make everything work nicely.  In\r\nthis case, Rust's defaults do exactly what you want.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to apply a similar fix to `with_backtrace`, but I\r\nhaven't looked at that yet.", "reactions": {"url":
