tests n0-computer/beetle#74\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n- Before we could get to fixing the flakiness, the test was hanging due to a bug in the `Providers` query manager. To summarize the issue: we weren't reacting to `GetProvidersOk::FinishedWithNoAdditionalRecord` events, which indicate no more records were found. Because this event was never handled, we never removed the `Query` from the `providers` Set, and so the stream of providers never closed, causing the `test_dht` test to hang.\r\n\r\n- To test reliability, I looped the `test_dht` 10 times for my initial commits, but removed the loop it once things stabilized.\r\n\r\n- I did a whole pass where the node emitted an event whenever the kbuckets were updated, and used that event to ensure everything was \"in place\" before attempting to `StartProviding` and `fetch_providers_dht`. However... this made things less reliable! So I removed it. It also would have potentially added a lot of \"noise\" to the `network_event` stream.\r\n\r\n- The only thing that actually stabilized the test (when attempting multiple loops)... was increasing the timeout by 1 second. I'm not sure how to feel about this.\r\n\r\n- In order to test the `CancelListenForIdentify`, I had to add a `NetworkEvent` that would emit after this cancellation happens. There was no other way I could think of that would allow us to inspect the node itself without breaking the borrow checker. This event would only ever be emitted due to a user action (manually attempting to lookup a peer), so I'm not concerned about it polluting the event space.", "reactions": {"url":
