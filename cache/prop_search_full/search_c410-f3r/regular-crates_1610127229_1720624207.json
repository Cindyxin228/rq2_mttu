<code>walk_tree_prefix</code>, and <code>walk_tree_postfix</code>\nfunctions enable custom parallel iteration over tree-like structures.</li>\n<li>The new method <code>ParallelIterator::collect_vec_list</code> returns items as a linked\nlist of vectors, which is an efficient mode of parallel collection used by\nmany of the internal implementations of <code>collect</code>.</li>\n<li>The new methods <code>ParallelSliceMut::par_split_inclusive_mut</code>,\n<code>ParallelSlice::par_split_inclusive</code>, and\n<code>ParallelString::par_split_inclusive</code> all work like a normal split but\nkeeping the separator as part of the left slice.</li>\n<li>The new <code>ParallelString::par_split_ascii_whitespace</code> splits only on ASCII\nwhitespace, which is faster than including Unicode multi-byte whitespace.</li>\n<li><code>OsString</code> now implements <code>FromParallelIterator&lt;_&gt;</code> and <code>ParallelExtend&lt;_&gt;</code>\nfor a few item types similar to the standard <code>FromIterator</code> and <code>Extend</code>.</li>\n<li>The
