(e.g. a read of T could read\n> some bytes from one value and some bytes from an adjacent one, resulting in a T\n> whose value representation is not meaningful). This is undefined behavior.\n>  \n> The flaw was corrected by using a pair of pointers to track the head and tail of\n> the deque instead of a pair of indices.
