"https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/pull/513.patch", "merged_at": "2021-12-20T00:17:57Z"}, "body": "As per the readme `.build()` should only be called as late as possible, and only if absolutely necessary; such cases include slices that are passed directly to functions.  More precisely, such build calls and the creation of temporary slices should happen inside the same expression as the function call to be sound and completely lifetime-checked.\n\nThis pattern of `&[my_builder.build()]` is however not possible when constructing intermediary Vulkan objects that reference the slice.  In the first place this slice goes out of scope after the expression that creates the Vulkan object, which is caught and disallowed by rustc (unless this expression itself ends in `.build()`, which is completely unsound as it makes rustc unable to validate this lifetime dependency).\n\nIn the second place - and as is most relevant for this patch that removes `.build()` calls that were not surrounded by temporary slice constructors - said expression drops the lifetime checks on anything held by `my_builder` which _could_ go out of scope before the newly constructed Vulkan object is used, resulting yet again in Undefined Behaviour.\n\nFortunately, for slices of size 1 which are typical in Vulkan, `std::slice::as_ref` exists which is analogous to taking a pointer to an object and considering it an array of length 1 in C(++).  This maintains the lifetime through `Deref` and makes rustc able to fully check all lifetimes and prevent unsound code.\n\nAlbeit improving overall consistency, the `&[my_builder.build()]` pattern is not substituted in aforementioned Vulkan function-call expressions as that is considered \"extraneous\" [1] and demonstrates the various ways to safely construct Vulkan objects for the observant reader.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash/pull/506#discussion_r762630648\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/issues/513/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/issues/513/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/issues/512", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/issues/512/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/issues/512/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/issues/512/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/pull/512", "id": 1084026709, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA-mZts4wCqwJ", "number": 512, "title": "Simplify triangle example's vertex input state", "user": {"login": "swooster", "id": 15894799, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODk0Nzk5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15894799?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster", "html_url": "https://github.com/swooster", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swooster/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-12-19T06:43:24Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-19T11:28:34Z", "closed_at": "2021-12-19T11:28:34Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ash-rs/ash/pulls/512", "html_url": "https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/pull/512", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/pull/512.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/pull/512.patch", "merged_at": "2021-12-19T11:28:34Z"}, "body": "Use a `PipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo` builder to pass a slice instead of a pointer and length.

just using the non-deprecated variant instead.  Furthermore, Ash is still allowing itself to perform breaking changes in its releases making this the perfect time to get rid of all these useless variants and the generator support code that comes with it.  No need to come up with a \"more proper\" variant name if we don't generate those that \"intentionally\" fail to adhere to the \"enum variant name\" specification in the first place.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~Perhaps we should reach a point where we just stop generating any variants with this discrepancy at all, given that we're releasing ash where breaking changes are allowed and `#[deprecated]` triggers check/clippy warnings already anyway.

generator could be taught to collect bitflags added by extensions, but new extensions get added over time skewing available values in ash versus the current driver/environment.  This makes the value from `all()` unreliable and fragile at best.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nKeeping this draft so that we can all give a final sign-off on removing `fn all()`. Alternatively we can collect all possible values in the generator, but in that case I prefer to just migrate over to `bitflags!` and provide all extension constants within the same block so that it's
