Cargo.\r\n\r\n## Remove `Cargo.lock`\r\n\r\nSince this is a library crate, there is no need to keep its `Cargo.lock` file:\r\nmost guidelines including [cargo documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html)\r\nrecommend ignoring it for library crates.\r\n\r\n## Explicitly specify feature dependencies\r\n\r\nFeatures now expicitly declare their dependencies using new `dep:${feature}` syntax which appeared in Rust 1.60.\r\nExplicit MSRV has also been specified for this reason.\r\n\r\n## Compile time error on no `hashing` specified\r\n\r\nThe compiler will now issue a custom error if no `hashing` implementation is cpecified.\r\n\r\n## Configure GitHub Actions for tests\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions have been configured to run tests on all feature sets.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> It suggested that you make this checks required for pull request merge via branch configuring protection rules in this repository.\r\n\r\n## Dependabot\r\n\r\nDependabot has been configured to update Cargo crates and GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n > **Note**\r\n> You may consider configuring its schedule so that it runs at the specific [time](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#scheduletime) such as:\r\n> ```yaml\r\n> schedule:\r\n>   interval: daily\r\n>   time: \"10:00\"\r\n>   timezone: Europe/Moscow\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n\r\n > **Note**\r\n> You may need to add `automatic` and `dependencies` labels to the repository so that dependabot can assign them.\r\n\r\n## Remove `Makefile`\r\n\r\nThis is the final cleanup after #1.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/alttch/hyper-static/issues/3/reactions",
