they choose\n- Allows users to create their own sender implementation that wraps the existing Hyper one, perhaps to log outgoing requests.\n- Lets us drop `yup-hyper-mock` as a dependency, as it was causing dependency version issues. The tests are simplified as a result.\n### Breaking Changes\n- Errors have changed quite a bit. Error::Internal is gone. Error::Http has been replaced with Error::HttpRequest, which now contains an HttpRequestError instead of a hyper::Error. This is to allow SlackWebRequestSender implementors to only need to implement a conversion of their client's errors into HttpRequestError. In addition, the error enums now contain a non-exhaustive hidden field. This allows future expansion of the enums without needing to make future breaking changes.\n\ncc: @BenTheElder @kiyoto \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slack-rs/slack-rs-api/issues/24/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slack-rs/slack-rs-api/issues/24/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
