submitting them.</p>\n<p>This release also improves the documentation, adds UI tests, and defaults the <code>subxt-cli</code> to return metadata\nbytes instead of the JSON format.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Handle <code>StorageEntry</code> empty keys (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/565\">#565</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix documentation

node's runtime upgrades to ensure that the metadata is updated and\nextrinsics are properly constructed.</p>\n<p>We have also made some slight API improvements to make in the area of storage keys, and thanks to an external contribution we now support dry running transactions before submitting them.</p>\n<p>This release also improves the documentation, adds UI tests, and defaults the <code>subxt-cli</code> to return metadata\nbytes instead of the JSON format.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Handle <code>StorageEntry</code> empty keys (<a

Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to \u0441atch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<p>Yaml example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yml\"><code>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
