[PolkaVM](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm) for Substrate's [`pallet-revive`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/revive) module.  \r\n\r\nIt's a big breaking change. With this PR we are moving towards the next major release of both ink! and `cargo-contract` (version 6). From v6 on these tools which will no longer support Wasm/`pallet-contracts`. \r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe PR uses the version of `polkadot-sdk` (so also `pallet-revive`) from commit `645878a27115db52e5d63115699b4bbb89034067`. \r\n\r\nIt works with ink! `master` (which at the time of writing is [this commit](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/commits/master/)) and [this](https://github.com/use-ink/substrate-contracts-node/commit/fad777f53ba2fcf8a90646a5c516015c63ad24be) version of `substrate-contracts-node`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo install --force --git https://github.com/use-ink/substrate-contracts-node.git --rev fad777f53ba2fcf8a90646a5c516015c63ad24be\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\nThe PR doesn't leave the code in a perfect state, there are still a lot of todo's in the code. I've disabled some individual tests for now, as they require more work. I'm merging the PR to have a base to work off and synchronize work with others.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains a lot of breaking changes that will eventually be documented in more verbatim form in the release notes and [this migration guide](https://use.ink/6.x/faq/migrating-from-ink-5-to-6/).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/cargo-contract/issues/1910/reactions", "total_count":

comment](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/pull/1190/files#diff-b18d9ef02a8395df7dcf8cc2d999cc16fe1fefe5b2151dfbd763f8b65e0c778dR465-R466), it looks like the actual intent was to \"guarantee that implicit overflows never happen\", if that's the case then like the `-C overflow-checks` for `rustc`, `-Dclippy::arithmetic_side_effects` is actually NOT sufficient.\r\nThis is because type cast operations (i.e. `as` conversions) can also cause implicit overflows/underflows (as well as other lossy conversions).\r\n\r\nThis PR enables additional clippy lints (see list below) to \"guarantee that overflowing/underflowing and lossy integer operations never happen (in the local crate)\". \r\n-

https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#cast_sign_loss\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** We intentionally ignore safe/lossless lints (e.g. `cast_lossless`), and lints where either the source or target type is not an integer type (e.g. `cast_precision_loss`, `char_lit_as_u8`, `as_conversions` e.t.c).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttps://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0560-integer-overflow.html#updates-since-being-accepted\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1019\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#semantics\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#overflow\r\n\r\n##
