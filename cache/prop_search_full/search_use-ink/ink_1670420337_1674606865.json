Requires the user to know which variant of `instantiate` to call based on the return type of the constructor. Granted it should not compile with the wrong one, but still will cause some friction.\r\n2. Code duplication all the way down, two versions of each `instantiate` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies the `instantaite` and `instantiate_fallible` versions of each method call, such that the user only needs to call `instantiate` or `instantiate_fallible`, and the `CreateBuilder` method will return either `Result<ContranctRef>` or plain `ContractRef`, depending on the actual return type of the constructor.\r\n\r\nSee this [UI

in which `LangError`s were returned from constructors. In\r\nthat PR we had no way to read the output buffer from `seal_instantiate` and bubble any \r\ninformation back up to the contract caller.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for reading this output buffer for both infallible and fallible\r\nconstructors.\r\n\r\nBecause of type checking problems I've had to add a new set of APIs for handling fallible\r\nconstructors. I'm still looking for a way to unify them, as mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1512/files#r1041508207).\r\nIf you have any ideas for improvements here I'd be happy to hear them.\r\n\r\nI've changed the `create_builder` API slightly to be more in-line with the `call_builder`\r\none (i.e removing the generic in favour of a `returns` method). \r\n\r\nFor infallible constructors, the main changes are:\r\n- The `CreateBuilder` now returns a `ConstructorResult` (introduced in #1504)\r\n    - This can optionally be handled using the new `try_instantiate` method\r\n\r\nFor fallible constructors:\r\n- We've added `intantiate_fallible` and `try_instantiate_fallible` `CreateBuilder` methods\r\n    - Like above, `ConstructorError`s are only bubbled up in the `try_*` variant\r\n    - Edit: This API is clunky, but Andrew's proposing a nicer solution in\r\n      https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1591\r\n- We've added a new environment API, `ink_env::instantiate_fallible_contract`\r\n\r\nI've also updated the codegen so that `ContractRef`s can be used to instantiate contracts,\r\nas an alternative to the \"raw\" `CreateBuilder` API.\r\n\r\nNotes for reviewers:\r\n- Keep in mind that there are two ways that the output buffer of `seal_instantiate` can\r\n  be written to:\r\n    - By the ink! codegen\r\n    - Manually by the callee contract using `ink_env::return_value`\r\n        - This second one is the one we need to worry about since people can (on purpose\r\n          or by accident) encode erroneous values in there\r\n- Related to the above, make sure to take a close look at the different output buffer\r\n  decoding scenarios\r\n- Take a look at the E2E tests to see if they make sense\r\n- Right now the E2E test fail in the CI, not because they're actually broken but because\r\n  of #1498\r\n  (run them locally if you don't believe me \ud83d\ude06) \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/issues/1512/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/issues/1512/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/issues/1511", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/issues/1511/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/issues/1511/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/issues/1511/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/1511", "id": 1455642563, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCZwVgs5DPKdV", "number": 1511, "title": "Migrate `contract-terminate` waterfall test to e2e", "user": {"login": "ascjones", "id": 75586, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75586?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones", "html_url": "https://github.com/ascjones", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ascjones/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-11-18T18:56:49Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-16T21:51:13Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-16T21:51:12Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/use-ink/ink/pulls/1511", "html_url": "https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/1511", "diff_url": "https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/1511.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/use-ink/ink/pull/1511.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-16T21:51:12Z"}, "body": "Part of #1510.\r\n\r\nMigrates the `contract-terminate` test from `ink-waterfall` https://github.com/paritytech/ink-waterfall/blob/819b12969a068de10b7984e5ce9957f79a0a53a7/src/tests/contract_terminate.rs#L33.\r\n\r\nChange the behaviour of the `ink_e2e::Client::call` method so that it does not panic if it fails to decode the dry run result.
