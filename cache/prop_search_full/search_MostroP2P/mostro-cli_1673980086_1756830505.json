#100 as reminder:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRemove of `nip59.rs` mod\r\n\r\ntesting to replace lot of lines of code with internal Sdk functions:\r\n\r\n- Added a cleaner way to fetch events removing old code to do that.\r\n- Tested a full cycle of sell order with new nip59 functions directly from sdk with success.\r\n- Need to understand if we can manage also user messages in similar way.\r\n\r\nTemporary note: \r\n\r\nAt the moment to make this compile we need to point to Nost-sdk in `cargo.toml` of `mostro-cli` and `mostro-core` like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nnostr-sdk = { git  = \"https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr\", features = [\"nip06\", \"nip44\", \"nip59\"], rev =\"70db575d51965240aab1e1b3f1edab782c0ef625\"}\r\n```\r\nand also use a local override of `mostro-core` to point to same nostr-sdk like, this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\nmostro-core = { path = \"../mostro-core\" }\r\n```\r\nthese 2 patches can be removed as soon as new release of sdk has been shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n\t- Introduced a new toolchain configuration for Rust, including specific parameters for the toolchain and components.\n\t- Added support for an expiration timestamp in the direct message sending functionality.\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\t- Improved error handling and return types across various database functions for better clarity and consistency.\n\n- **Refactor**\n\t- Simplified the handling of user ratings and trade keys in command execution.\n\t- Streamlined event fetching and message processing logic.\n\n- **Removal**\n\t- Deprecated the `nip59` module and its associated functions related to gift wrapping events.\n\t- Removed unused functions related to relay requests to enhance code clarity.\n\t- Removed the `trade_keys` parameter from the `execute_send_dm` function, replacing it with a database query

pointed out from a tg user yesteday there were some strange behaviour on orders showed in web interface, going a bit deeper with analysis I discovered some issue due to async in states of NIP33 messages. We know that Nostr relays are dumb, so we need to move \"smartness\" on client side.\r\n\r\nWhat happened is this picture below, same order has `pending `state and `canceled `state:\r\n![image](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro-cli/assets/113362043/960bda07-4cf0-4ea9-a1d0-88f35dee3fe2)\r\n\r\nwhat happened imo is that order was created, let me say, with all relay correctly up and running, then user canceled order from mostro intreface after some time, this time not all relays were ok, so on the active ones NIP33 correctly updated the event, but not on unresponsive ones. Now requesting event from CLI or web lead to the issue showed in the image: that order has not be visualize on the interface, but the pending one still shows up, mostro need to just the most recent order if some shows up with same ID!\r\n\r\nOk...\r\n\r\n@grunch after that showed me on tg that also CLI could have the same problem and yesterday I tried to fight with relays issue and i drop here an untested idea to solve it ( i am in office and they fuck me up connections with relays ).\r\nWhat CLI tries to do now is:\r\n\r\n- Request all events on mostro custom Kind ( no more filtering for status )\r\n- Collect all events\r\n- Order events by id\r\n- Check duplicate id and prepare to remove the older duplicates\r\n\r\nNot so easy to do, but I got a starting point to test in this PR, meanwhile think about this issue also in webclient, in the case above web mostro must discard pending order.\r\n\r\nEdge case:\r\n\r\n- order create ( all relays ok)\r\n- order cancel ( some relays KO )\r\n- Listorders\r\n- Now relays that were aligned are down and unaligned one respond with wrong order\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
