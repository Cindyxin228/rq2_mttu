pointed out from a tg user yesteday there were some strange behaviour on orders showed in web interface, going a bit deeper with analysis I discovered some issue due to async in states of NIP33 messages. We know that Nostr relays are dumb, so we need to move \"smartness\" on client side.\r\n\r\nWhat happened is this picture below, same order has `pending `state and `canceled `state:\r\n![image](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro-cli/assets/113362043/960bda07-4cf0-4ea9-a1d0-88f35dee3fe2)\r\n\r\nwhat happened imo is that order was created, let me say, with all relay correctly up and running, then user canceled order from mostro intreface after some time, this time not all relays were ok, so on the active ones NIP33 correctly updated the event, but not on unresponsive ones. Now requesting event from CLI or web lead to the issue showed in the image: that order has not be visualize on the interface, but the pending one still shows up, mostro need to just the most recent order if some shows up with same ID!\r\n\r\nOk...\r\n\r\n@grunch after that showed me on tg that also CLI could have the same problem and yesterday I tried to fight with relays issue and i drop here an untested idea to solve it ( i am in office and they fuck me up connections with relays ).\r\nWhat CLI tries to do now is:\r\n\r\n- Request all events on mostro custom Kind ( no more filtering for status )\r\n- Collect all events\r\n- Order events by id\r\n- Check duplicate id and prepare to remove the older duplicates\r\n\r\nNot so easy to do, but I got a starting point to test in this PR, meanwhile think about this issue also in webclient, in the case above web mostro must discard pending order.\r\n\r\nEdge case:\r\n\r\n- order create ( all relays ok)\r\n- order cancel ( some relays KO )\r\n- Listorders\r\n- Now relays that were aligned are down and unaligned one respond with wrong order\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
