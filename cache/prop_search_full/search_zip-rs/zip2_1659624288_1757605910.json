keep encrypted flag and AES 0x9901 extra field (no re-encryption).\r\n* `ZipFile::options()` now carries AES metadata so downstream writes produce correct headers.\r\n\r\n### Key Changes\r\n\r\n* **write.rs:**\r\n\r\n  * `start_entry`: write AES extra field (0x9901) using `aes_mode`, set method=99.\r\n  * `raw_copy_file_rename_internal`: no password required; relies on options() metadata.\r\n* **types.rs:** encrypted flag set when `aes_mode` present.\r\n* **read.rs:** `options()` preserves AES metadata for copied entries.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n* No public API changes.\r\n* Non-AES entries unchanged.\r\n* All tests pass (including AES cases).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/417/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

I also expect all the crate's methods to\r\nremain panic-free, so that this crate can be used on servers without creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThese are our requirements for PRs, in addition to the usual functionality and readability requirements:\r\n- This codebase sometimes changes rapidly. Please rebase your branch before opening a pull request, and \r\n  grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch (so I can fix later conflicts without being subject \r\n  to the limitations of the web UI) if EITHER of the following apply:\r\n  - It has been at least 24 hours since you forked the repo or previously rebased the branch; or\r\n  - 5 or more pull requests are already open at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pulls. PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch).

This block should restrict GITHUB_TOKEN access, preferably to the minimal `contents: read`, unless some jobs need additional privileges (e.g., `pull-requests: write`). In this case, since no jobs appear to require write privileges, setting `permissions: contents: read` at the top level suffices and applies to all jobs. The change should be added directly below the workflow name (line 1). No additional imports, definitions, or code changes are needed, just the addition of this YAML block.\n\n---\n\n\n_Suggested fixes powered by Copilot Autofix.

The main advantage is, that the crate is native Rust and is also used by the seven-zip2 crate.\r\n\r\nPerformance should be equal to the liblzma crate, since I spend quite a bit of time to improve both decoding and encoding performance.\r\n\r\nI only used the single threaded version of the reader/writer, since parallelization was not enabled for liblzma. lzma-rust2 has multithreaded reader/writer though.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixed the LZMA decoding. The old implementation actually didn't worked. The test file used STORE as compression. I checked the APPNOTE.txt to make sure that the properties are properly read. The test file is also updated (created with 7zip).\r\n\r\nI had to change the signature of the public function `Decoder::new()`, since the LZMA decoder needs to know the uncompressed size to limit the range decoder. The LZMA stream CAN include an end-of-stream marker (EOS), but this is not guranteed. Most files out there have an EOS, but the specification allows LZMA streams without it (so it's best to limit the LZMA decoder with the uncompressed size).

I also expect all the crate's methods to\r\nremain panic-free, so that this crate can be used on servers without creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThese are our requirements for PRs, in addition to the usual functionality and readability requirements:\r\n- This codebase sometimes changes rapidly. Please rebase your branch before opening a pull request, and \r\n  grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch (so I can fix later conflicts without being subject \r\n  to the limitations of the web UI) if EITHER of the following apply:\r\n  - It has been at least 24 hours since you forked the repo or previously rebased the branch; or\r\n  - 5 or more pull requests are already open at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pulls. PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch). I will attempt to fix merge\r\n    conflicts, but this is best-effort.\r\n- Please make sure your PR's target repo is `zip-rs/zip2` and not `zip-rs/zip-old`. The latter\r\n  repo is no longer maintained, and I will archive it after closing the pre-existing issues.\r\n- Your changes must build against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version.\r\n- PRs must pass all the checks specified in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, which include:\r\n  - Unit tests, run with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` AND with the default features, each run\r\n    against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version, on Windows, MacOS \r\n    AND Ubuntu (yes, that's a 3-dimensional matrix).\r\n  - `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo doc --no-deps` must pass with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` \r\n    AND with the default features.\r\n  - `cargo fmt --check --all` must pass.\r\n- If the above checks force you to add a new `#[allow]` attribute, please place a comment on the same line or just above it, \r\n  explaining what the exception applies to and why it's needed.\r\n- The PR title must conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and start \r\n  with one of the types specified by the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\r\n  This is also recommended for commit messages; but it's not required, because they'll be replaced when the PR is squash-merged.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for submitting a bug fix or proposed feature that meets these requirements!\r\n-->\r\nFixes #381.", "reactions": {"url":

I ported the PPMd algorithm of 7zip from C to Rust in the last weeks and PPMd has now a byte to byte compatible Rust native crate, which this PR uses. The sevenz-rust2 crate also uses it for supporting PPMd.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where to decode the paramater for PPMd as defined in the specification (\"5.10 PPMd - Method 98\") from the reader, since we can't do that in `Decompressor::new()` (the `copy`()` test of the end to end test suite would fail otherwise). I currently do initialize the decoder when we first read, since that seems most compatible with copy functionality.\r\n\r\nI added a test file I created with 7zip which decodes fine. I also tested a ZIP file that the crate would produce with 7zip and it can be read correctly. For the compression level I chose to use the same levels / parametr values as 7zip is using (1 to 9).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/370/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/370/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/368", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/368/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/368/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/368/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/368", "id": 3161445419, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJaavgM6bUYP8", "number": 368, "title": "fix: Include magic signature when writing data descriptors", "user": {"login": "chenxiaolong", "id": 646253, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI1Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/646253?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong", "html_url": "https://github.com/chenxiaolong", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenxiaolong/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-06-19T22:21:17Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-22T23:20:06Z", "closed_at": "2025-06-21T01:09:14Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/pulls/368", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/368", "diff_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/368.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/368.patch", "merged_at": "2025-06-21T01:09:13Z"}, "body": "Per section 4.3.9.4 of `APPNOTE`, writers should include the magic signature for data descriptors.

field \"Version needed to extract\" contained in the EOCD64 header is higher than the field \"Version made by\", making `ZipArchive::new()` return `InvalidArchive(\"Could not find EOCD\")` for these types of files.\r\n\r\nAlthough the current behavior may be considered correct, there is currently no other tool as far as I am aware that returns an error or fails to parse these files completely. `zip -T` and `unzip -t`, for example, validate these types of archives with no errors.\r\n\r\nThis issue is somewhat prevalent as it disallows reading Zip64 archives downloaded from GitHub directly.\r\n\r\nEven if this pull request is not accepted, I would still suggest improving the currently returning error message, as the more correct `\"ZIP64 footer indicates a new version is needed to extract this archive than the version that wrote it\"` is lost during the second run of the `ZipArchive::get_metadata` loop:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// ZipArchive::get_metadata\r\nloop {\r\n    // Find the EOCD and possibly EOCD64 entries and determine the archive offset.\r\n    // >> This returns the correct error during the first loop, however the error is\r\n    // >> subsequently ignored as the function tries to search for another EOCD instance.\r\n    let cde = spec::find_central_directory(\r\n        reader,\r\n        config.archive_offset,\r\n        end_exclusive,\r\n        file_len,\r\n    )?;\r\n\r\n    // Turn EOCD into internal representation.\r\n    let Ok(shared) = CentralDirectoryInfo::try_from(&cde)\r\n        .and_then(|info| Self::read_central_header(info, config, reader))\r\n    else {\r\n        // The next EOCD candidate should start before the current one.\r\n        end_exclusive = cde.eocd.position;\r\n        continue;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return Ok(shared.build(\r\n        cde.eocd.data.zip_file_comment,\r\n        cde.eocd64.map(|v| v.data.extensible_data_sector),\r\n    ));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Removed `CentralDirectoryEndInfo` to `CentralDirectoryInfo` `TryFrom` implementation's `eocd64.version_needed_to_extract > eocd64.version_made_by` validation check.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n#251 ",

I will attempt to fix merge\n    conflicts, but this is best-effort.\n- Please make sure your PR's target repo is `zip-rs/zip2` and not `zip-rs/zip-old`. The latter\n  repo is no longer maintained, and I will archive it after closing the pre-existing issues.\n- Your changes must build against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version.\n- PRs must pass all the checks specified in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, which include:\n  - Unit tests, run with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` AND with the default features, each run\n    against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version, on Windows, MacOS \n    AND Ubuntu (yes, that's a 3-dimensional matrix).\n  - `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo doc --no-deps` must pass with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` \n    AND with the default features.\n  - `cargo fmt --check --all` must pass.\n- If the above checks force you to add a new `#[allow]` attribute, please place a comment on the same line or just above it, \n  explaining what the exception applies to and why it's needed.\n- The PR title must conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and start \n  with one of the types specified by the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\n  This is also recommended for commit messages; but it's not required, because they'll be replaced when the PR is squash-merged.\n\nThanks in advance for submitting a bug fix or proposed feature that meets these requirements!\n-->\n", "reactions": {"url":

This means that it cannot be used to **decompress** DEFLATE streams. However, the code currently implies this, and tries to build flate2-related code paths because zopfli sets `_deflate_any`.\r\n\r\nHowever, unsetting `_deflate_any` is not enough: zopfli can still compress DEFLATE streams even if it can't decompress them.\r\n\r\nSo to make sure everything is still OK, allow decompression of DEFLATE only when `flate2` is active, but allow compression both when only `zopfli` is active (in this case, shift the compression level by 9 so the same functionality takes place as when flate2 is enabled), and when both `zopfli` and `flate2` are active (in this case, use `flate2` when compression level is less than 9, and `zopfli` when compression level is higher than 9, as the original intent).\r\n\r\nThe `if cfg!(...)` paradigm only works if both conditional blocks can compile regardless of the config options, so instead we must use `#[cfg[...]]` to compile out the parts that can't compile when `flate2` is not available.\r\n\r\nAs for the compression level ranges:\r\n- only zopfli: 1-254\r\n- only flate2: fast-best (1-9)\r\n- both zopfli and flate2: fast-254 (1-254)\r\n  - flate2 takes place between 1-9\r\n  - zopfli takes place between 10-254\r\n\r\nTests have been modified: some tests require writing DEFLATE zip files as well. Those tests are disabled when DEFLATE can't be compressed, only uncompressed. Two doctests require writing DEFLATE zip files as well, so these doctests are now protected with the config guard.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow has also been extended to build two more variants of the crate: one with only `flate2` enabled and one with only `zopfli` enabled.\r\n\r\nThe CI/CD pipeline builds fine: https://github.com/darktohka/zip2/actions/runs/14960898954\r\n\r\nTo test this pull request:\r\n1. git clone `https://github.com/darktohka/zip-flate2-zopfli-feature-repro`\r\n2. cd ..\r\n3. cd [zopfli-only-success-fixed](https://github.com/darktohka/zip-flate2-zopfli-feature-repro/tree/master/zopfli-only-success-fixed)\r\n4. `cargo build` ==> builds fine", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/348/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/348/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/345", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/345/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/345/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/345/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/345", "id": 3046851948, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJaavgM6VUiEh", "number": 345, "title": "fix: Specify `flate2` dependency of the `deflate-flate2` feature.", "user": {"login": "anforowicz", "id": 12191912, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkxOTEy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12191912?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz", "html_url": "https://github.com/anforowicz", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anforowicz/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-05-07T18:34:17Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-10T02:37:47Z", "closed_at": "2025-05-10T02:37:47Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/pulls/345", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/345", "diff_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/345.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/345.patch", "merged_at": "2025-05-10T02:37:47Z"}, "body": "PTAL?\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/issues/344\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nRE: PR requirements\r\n\r\n- I don't know how to grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch...

`--all-features` AND with the default features, each run\r\n    against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version, on Windows, MacOS \r\n    AND Ubuntu (yes, that's a 3-dimensional matrix).\r\n  - `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo doc --no-deps` must pass with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` \r\n    AND with the default features.\r\n  - `cargo fmt --check --all` must pass.\r\n- If the above checks force you to add a new `#[allow]` attribute, please place a comment on the same line or just above it, \r\n  explaining what the exception applies to and why it's needed.\r\n- The PR title must conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and start \r\n  with one of the types specified by the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\r\n  This is also recommended for commit messages; but it's not required, because they'll be replaced when the PR is squash-merged.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for submitting a bug fix or proposed feature that meets these requirements!\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch). I will attempt to fix merge\r\n    conflicts, but this is best-effort.\r\n- Please make sure your PR's target repo is `zip-rs/zip2` and not `zip-rs/zip-old`.

extraction.\r\n\r\nIt's very typical to find Zip archives that consist of a single, sole, top-level, root directory containing the rest of the archive's entries. In some cases this might be something the developer wants to \"unwrap\" when extracting.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nImagine a Zip archive with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nroot/file1.txt\r\nroot/file2.txt\r\nroot/sub/file3.txt\r\nroot/sub/subsub/file4.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the archive is extracted to `foo` using `ZipArchive::extract`, the resulting directory structure will be:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nfoo/root/file1.txt\r\nfoo/root/file2.txt\r\nfoo/root/sub/file3.txt\r\nfoo/root/sub/subsub/file4.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the archive is extracted to `foo` using `ZipArchive::extract_unwrapped_root_dir`, the resulting directory structure will be:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nfoo/file1.txt\r\nfoo/file2.txt\r\nfoo/sub/file3.txt\r\nfoo/sub/subsub/file4.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example - No Root Directory\r\n\r\nImagine a Zip archive with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nroot/file1.txt\r\nroot/file2.txt\r\nroot/sub/file3.txt\r\nroot/sub/subsub/file4.txt\r\nother/file5.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nDue to the presence of the `other` directory, `ZipArchive::extract_unwrapped_root_dir` will extract this in the same fashion as `ZipArchive::extract` as there is now no \"root directory.\"", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/304/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/304/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/303", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/303/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/303/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/303/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/303", "id": 2893428757, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJaavgM6NRJ-a", "number": 303, "title": "feat: Add legacy shrink/reduce/implode compression", "user": {"login": "mkrueger", "id": 341098, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTA5OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/341098?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger", "html_url": "https://github.com/mkrueger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mkrueger/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2025-03-04T08:46:01Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-03T04:14:41Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-10T03:04:42Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/pulls/303", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/303", "diff_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/303.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/303.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-10T03:04:42Z"}, "body": "Replaces https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/120\r\n\r\nThe original PR grew too large to sanely merge it -

month (see https://crates.io/crates/zip),\r\nand because ZIP file processing has caused security issues in the past (see \r\nhttps://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-search.php?f=1&vendor=&product=zip&cweid=&cvssscoremin=&cvssscoremax=&publishdatestart=&publishdateend=&updatedatestart=&updatedateend=&cisaaddstart=&cisaaddend=&cisaduestart=&cisadueend=&page=1\r\nfor the gory details), we have some requirements that help ensure we maintain developers' and their clients' trust.\r\nThis implies some requirements that a lot of PRs don't initially meet.\r\n\r\nThis crate doesn't filter out \"ZIP bombs\" because extreme compression ratios and shallow file copies have legitimate uses; but\r\nI expect the tools the crate provides for checking that extraction is safe, such as the `ZipArchive::decompressed_size` method in\r\nhttps://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/blob/master/src/read.rs, to remain reliably effective. I also expect all the crate's methods to\r\nremain panic-free, so that this crate can be used on servers without creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThese are our requirements for PRs, in addition to the usual functionality and readability requirements:\r\n- This codebase sometimes changes rapidly. Please rebase your branch before opening a pull request, and \r\n  grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch (so I can fix later conflicts without being subject \r\n  to the limitations of the web UI) if EITHER of the following apply:\r\n  - It has been at least 24 hours since you forked the repo or previously rebased the branch; or\r\n  - 5 or more pull requests are already open at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pulls. PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch).

Being all rust, and using (by default) the rust allocator infrastructure, cross-compilation (e.g. to webassembly) should be much easier.</p>\n<p>Besides that, the documentation was modernized (we can

I also expect all the crate's methods to\r\nremain panic-free, so that this crate can be used on servers without creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThese are our requirements for PRs, in addition to the usual functionality and readability requirements:\r\n- This codebase sometimes changes rapidly. Please rebase your branch before opening a pull request, and \r\n  grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch (so I can fix later conflicts without being subject \r\n  to the limitations of the web UI) if EITHER of the following apply:\r\n  - It has been at least 24 hours since you forked the repo or previously rebased the branch; or\r\n  - 5 or more pull requests are already open at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pulls. PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch). I will attempt to fix merge\r\n    conflicts, but this is best-effort.\r\n- Please make sure your PR's target repo is `zip-rs/zip2` and not `zip-rs/zip-old`. The latter\r\n  repo is no longer maintained, and I will archive it after closing the pre-existing issues.\r\n- Your changes must build against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version.\r\n- PRs must pass all the checks specified in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, which include:\r\n  - Unit tests, run with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` AND with the default features, each run\r\n    against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version, on Windows, MacOS \r\n    AND Ubuntu (yes, that's a 3-dimensional matrix).\r\n  - `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo doc --no-deps` must pass with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` \r\n    AND with the default features.\r\n  - `cargo fmt --check --all` must pass.\r\n- If the above checks force you to add a new `#[allow]` attribute, please place a comment on the same line or just above it, \r\n  explaining what the exception applies to and why it's needed.\r\n- The PR title must conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and start \r\n  with one of the types specified by the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\r\n  This is also recommended for commit messages; but it's not required, because they'll be replaced when the PR is squash-merged.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for submitting a bug fix or proposed feature that meets these requirements!\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Thanks!\r\nI have some tweaks here that can improve the performance even more. But even if these changes do not get accepted, I think #93 is probably fast enough for my use case\u2014the old-zip code was taking somewhere between 200ms and 500ms to search for the end-of-central-directory-record, the new code is in the 30ms to 60ms range. It's not amazing but it's 10x faster and (more importantly) just under the human perception of lag.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are 3 commits here:\r\n\r\n1. A benchmark for the particular behavior I am seeing. It creates a 17MB file of zeros and measures how fast the code fails the open. I used a temporary file instead of a large buffer so that it would include real `read()` round-trips from the kernel.\r\n    Note: I had issues running the benchmarks. It seems like [this change](9722dd31e9f54873d11c85820d25b5ee344bc89a) might have broken one of them. As an aside, when I was reading the [pkzip appnote](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT) for this PR, I happened across section `4.4.1.4` which sounds like it might apply to this breakage.\r\n    To get past this I always just ran the one benchmark I cared about:\r\n    ```\r\n    cargo bench --bench read_metadata -- parse_large_non_zip\r\n    ```\r\n    This new benchmark code uses `TempDir` so I made this branch on top of #254. Apologies if that makes it more annoying to merge.\r\n\r\n3. A patch to enlarge the `END_WINDOW_SIZE` in `Zip32CentralDirectoryEnd::find_and_parse()`. I benchmarked several different sizes from 512 to 65536. Here are the results I got:\r\n\r\n    | _Machine_ | `END_WINDOW_SIZE` | Benchmark results      |\r\n    |-----------|  ---------------: |  ---------------:      |\r\n    | Mac   | 512   |  `30,450,608 ns/iter (+/- 673,910)  `  |\r\n    | Mac   | 4096  |  ` 7,741,366 ns/iter (+/- 521,101)  `  |\r\n    | Mac   | 8192  |  ` 5,773,801 ns/iter (+/- 411,277)  `  |\r\n    | Mac   | 16384 |  ` 4,792,533 ns/iter (+/- 332,918)  `  |\r\n    | Mac   | 32768 |  ` 4,324,072 ns/iter (+/- 384,048)  `  |\r\n    | Mac   | 65536 |  ` 4,047,872 ns/iter (+/- 352,416)  `  |\r\n    | linux | 512   |  `65,132,581 ns/iter (+/- 7,429,976)`  |\r\n    | linux | 4096  |  `14,109,503 ns/iter (+/- 2,892,086)`  |\r\n    | linux | 8192  |  ` 9,942,500 ns/iter (+/- 1,886,063)`  |\r\n    | linux | 16384 |  ` 8,205,851 ns/iter (+/- 2,902,041)`  |\r\n    | linux | 32768 |  ` 7,012,011 ns/iter (+/- 2,222,879)`  |\r\n    | linux | 65536 |  ` 6,577,275 ns/iter (+/- 881,546)  `  |\r\n\r\n    The linux box is an x86_64 running Debian testing. Its `/tmp` is a tmpfs mount. The mac is an M1 running macOS 15.0.1. Its `/tmp` is an apfs backed by an SSD.\r\n\r\n    From those times, 8192 seems to be the sweet spot. It's significantly (~6x) faster than 512 and increasing it doesn't further improve performance by very much. So the patch uses 8192.\r\n\r\n    I don't anticipate this patch being controversial as it doesn't really affect anything except using a tiny bit more RAM while loading the zip.\r\n\r\n4. A patch to shorten the search window at the end. I tested 3 configurations here: searching the whole file, searching the last 128K and searching the last 66,000 bytes. I did these benchmarks with all the `END_WINDOW_SIZE`s combos shown above, but they aren't interesting so I'm just going to show the 8192 size here. Here are the results I got:\r\n\r\n    | _Machine_ | Search Technique  | Benchmark results                   |\r\n    |-----------| :---------------  | ----------------:                   |\r\n    | mac       | whole file        | `5,773,801 ns/iter (+/- 411,277)  ` |\r\n    | mac       | last 128k         | `   54,402 ns/iter (+/- 4,126)    ` |\r\n    | mac       | last 66k          | `   36,152 ns/iter (+/- 4,293)    ` |\r\n    | linux     | whole file        | `9,942,500 ns/iter (+/- 1,886,063)` |\r\n    | linux     | last 128k         | `   73,604 ns/iter (+/- 16,662)   ` |\r\n    | linux     | last 66k          | `   41,483 ns/iter (+/- 19,692)   ` |\r\n\r\n    As you might expect, closing this windows makes a extremely large difference when the file is large.\r\n\r\n    Since 7a559457431f3418bcc0bcb9ba68559b3b57de99, current code searches the entire file. Previously it searched the last 66,000 bytes (52375437dc3b95c8786d12d5f85b51d0a792ee66). Before that, it searched 65557 bytes, as discussed in [zip-old#183](https://github.com/zip-rs/zip-old/issues/183).\r\n\r\n    pkware's zip implementation isn't open source so it's hard to check, but a comment in [zip-old#183](https://github.com/zip-rs/zip-old/issues/183) claims it uses 66,000 bytes which is where that number came from.\r\n\r\n    Info-Zip, however, seems to be the main zip program shipped in Debian, Homebrew, Nix, Fedora, etc. Its official source is [only available on an ftp site](ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/src/zip30.tgz), though there's someone's random fork on github that I'll link to. The relevant part is [here](https://github.com/hiirotsuki/infozip/blob/bb0c4755d44f21bda0744a5e1868d25055a543cc/zipfile.c#L4073) and is the same as the info-zip source from the ftp site. They search back `0x20000` bytes, which is 128K.\r\n\r\n    Given that is the de-factor zip in the open source would and seems to be more generous than pkzip, it seems like this is a reasonable number to split the difference between (overly?) strict spec adherence (65557 bytes) and searching the whole file.\r\n\r\n    That was a long winded way of saying that in the 3rd patch I chose to limit the search to the last 128K of the file.\r\n\r\nI understand the last one might be more controversial given that it could impact compatibility. I believe the 128K is pretty reasonable number for the reasons give above, but I've left the PR in 3 commits so its easier if you don't want that last one.\r\n\r\nLocal test checklist:\r\n- [X] `cargo test`\r\n- [X] `cargo test --no-default-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo test --all-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo clippy --all-targets`\r\n- [X] `cargo clippy --all-targets --no-default-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo doc --no-deps`\u2020\r\n- [X] `cargo doc --no-deps --no-default-features`\u2020\r\n- [X] `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`\u2020\r\n- [X] `cargo fmt --check --all`\r\n\r\n\u2020: Had warnings unrelated to these changes.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/255/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/255/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/254", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/254/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/254/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/254/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/254", "id": 2606432778, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJaavgM5_gsdz", "number": 254, "title": "deps(dev): Use the tempfile crate instead of the deprecated tempdir crate", "user": {"login": "caldwell", "id": 45445, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDQ1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45445?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell", "html_url": "https://github.com/caldwell", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caldwell/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-10-22T20:32:18Z", "updated_at": "2024-11-19T20:58:18Z", "closed_at": "2024-11-19T20:58:18Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/pulls/254", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/254", "diff_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/254.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/254.patch", "merged_at": "2024-11-19T20:58:18Z"}, "body": "The deprecation note is [here](https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated/tempdir?tab=readme-ov-file#deprecation-note) (and visible on the [crates.io page](https://crates.io/crates/tempdir)).\r\n\r\n[`tempfile::TempDir`](https://docs.rs/tempfile/latest/tempfile/struct.TempDir.html) has a very similar interface, though not precisely a drop in.\r\n\r\nLocally tested on debian x86_64 rustc 1.84.0-nightly (439284741 2024-10-21):\r\n- [X] `cargo test`\r\n- [X] `cargo test --no-default-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo test --all-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo clippy --all-targets`\r\n- [X] `cargo clippy --all-targets --no-default-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`\r\n- [X] `cargo doc --no-deps`\u00b9\r\n- [X] `cargo doc --no-deps --no-default-features`\u00b9\r\n- [X] `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`\u00b9\r\n- [X] `cargo fmt --check --all`\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n1.

The motivation is to fix the extreme performance regression introduced in https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/commit/cb2d7abde7863a4ce01dbac5b3b48b4006e60599. This PR is also expected to close #231.\r\n\r\n## What was wrong\r\n\r\nIn the previous iteration, the `ZipArchive::get_metadata` function scanned the entire contents of the archive (in extreme cases multiple times) and contained some amount of backtracking even in the best case scenario of no prepended junk data. There was also a lot of code duplication in the functions for finding EOCD and EOCD64 blocks.\r\n\r\n## What this PR introduces\r\n\r\nA `MagicFinder` pseudo-iterator is implemented for generic magic needle search from the end of a seekable reader. An additional `OptimisticMagicFinder` is implemented for the best case scenario, where the archive offset is either known exactly or is equal to zero, so that no scanning is performed, as it would be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe `find_and_parse` methods of `Zip32CentralDirectoryEnd` and `Zip64CentralDirectoryEnd` are replaced with a common `find_central_directory` function. The function employs the following strategy to locate EOCD and EOCD64 if it is expected to be present:\r\n\r\n* A `MagicFinder` is used to find EOCD magic bytes\r\n* The EOCD block is parsed and it's internal validity is checked, discarding the entry if it's invalid\r\n* It is determined whether the EOCD contents indicate the file is ZIP64\r\n* In the ZIP32 case:\r\n  * An empty archive is assumed to always be correct and is returned\r\n  * A non empty archive attempts to look for the first CDFH between the relative offset in EOCD and the EOCD offset\r\n  * If found, the archive offset is determined and the entry is returned, otherwise it is discarded\r\n* In the ZIP64 case:\r\n  * The EOCD64 Locator is parsed at it's expected position\r\n  * Its internal validity is checked\r\n  * EOCD64 magic bytes are searched for between the relative offset in the Locator and Locator's own offset\r\n  * If EOCD64 is found and is internally valid, the archive offset is determined and the EOCD + EOCD64 are returned\r\n\r\nThe code for `get_metadata` was simplified, because additional information is now available after finding the EOCDs (the archive offset in particular).\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nIn my internal testing (reading a 44MB ZIP with 30 files to obtain the file count), the extreme performance regression is gone, while still satisfying all of the tests.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2.1.3: ~6.2ms\r\n2.2.0: ~14s\r\nThis PR: ~13.5ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly there are still some performance regressions left, but according to my testing, the code path I spent optimizing takes only 0.3ms out of the 13.5ms, so the regression must lie elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## What remains to be done\r\n\r\n- [ ] get feedback for the EOCD/CFHD naming convention in ZipErrors\r\n- [ ] deprecating the `ArchiveOffset::FromCentralDirectory` option?\r\n- [x] reconciling EOCD and EOCD64 archive comments\r\n\r\n### Naming conventions for byte blocks\r\n\r\nIn this PR I use the original naming convention for the different type of blocks (End Of Central Directory instead of Central Directory End, etc.). If this is wrong, please, let me know, I will revert this. If you'd like me to change the rest of the errors to match the official convention, I'd also be happy to do that.\r\n\r\n### `ArchiveOffset::FromCentralDirectory`  deprecation\r\n\r\nThis option was previously respected for ZIP32 only, but the logic did not make much sense to me. GitHub search reveals that there is not public repository using this option. Could you, please, clarify, what the intent with this feature was? The way I see it, it's enough to have an option to do offset detection if the initial guess fails and also to have the `Known` variant to opt-out of the detection mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Archive comments duality\r\n\r\nPreviously, this PR introduced a breaking change, where the `ZipArchive` comment for ZIP64 is now read from EOCD64 instead of EOCD. Instead, I introduced the `zip64_comment` field in `Shared` and made the field available separately. Now both can be used by the users and it should be clear which is which.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/247/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 6, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/247/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/246", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/246/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/246/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/issues/246/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/246", "id": 2502479774, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJaavgM56Pidi", "number": 246, "title": "feat: Write ZIP file to stream", "user": {"login": "JakubOnderka", "id": 163343, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163343?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka", "html_url": "https://github.com/JakubOnderka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JakubOnderka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 6901182739, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJaavgM8AAAABm1exEw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/labels/Please%20fix%20failing%20tests", "name": "Please fix failing tests", "color": "3EBB12", "default": false, "description": "Tests are failing with this change; please fix them."}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-09-03T10:16:04Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-18T14:20:57Z", "closed_at": "2025-06-18T09:13:35Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zip-rs/zip2/pulls/246", "html_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/246", "diff_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/246.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/246.patch", "merged_at": "2025-06-18T09:13:35Z"}, "body": "Sometimes it is not possible or unnecessary to first write ZIP file to disk and then stream it to external system for example by HTTP protocol.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces new method `ZipWriter::new_stream`, that do not require Seek trait, so it is possible to stream ZIP file directly to output without Seek.\r\n\r\nStreaming is supported by \"data descriptor\" that is written after compressed file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n4.3.5 File data MAY be followed by a \"data descriptor\" for the file.

I also expect all the crate's methods to\r\nremain panic-free, so that this crate can be used on servers without creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThese are our requirements for PRs, in addition to the usual functionality and readability requirements:\r\n- This codebase sometimes changes rapidly. Please rebase your branch before opening a pull request, and \r\n  grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch (so I can fix later conflicts without being subject \r\n  to the limitations of the web UI) if EITHER of the following apply:\r\n  - It has been at least 24 hours since you forked the repo or previously rebased the branch; or\r\n  - 5 or more pull requests are already open at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pulls. PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch). I will attempt to fix merge\r\n    conflicts, but this is best-effort.\r\n- Please make sure your PR's target repo is `zip-rs/zip2` and not `zip-rs/zip-old`. The latter\r\n  repo is no longer maintained, and I will archive it after closing the pre-existing issues.\r\n- Your changes must build against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version.\r\n- PRs must pass all the checks specified in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, which include:\r\n  - Unit tests, run with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` AND with the default features, each run\r\n    against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version, on Windows, MacOS \r\n    AND Ubuntu (yes, that's a 3-dimensional matrix).\r\n  - `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo doc --no-deps` must pass with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` \r\n    AND with the default features.\r\n  - `cargo fmt --check --all` must pass.\r\n- If the above checks force you to add a new `#[allow]` attribute, please place a comment on the same line or just above it, \r\n  explaining what the exception applies to and why it's needed.\r\n- The PR title must conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and start \r\n  with one of the types specified by the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\r\n  This is also recommended for commit messages; but it's not required, because they'll be replaced when the PR is squash-merged.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for submitting a bug fix or proposed feature that meets these requirements!\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

file processing has caused security issues in the past (see \r\nhttps://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-search.php?f=1&vendor=&product=zip&cweid=&cvssscoremin=&cvssscoremax=&publishdatestart=&publishdateend=&updatedatestart=&updatedateend=&cisaaddstart=&cisaaddend=&cisaduestart=&cisadueend=&page=1\r\nfor the gory details), we have some requirements that help ensure we maintain developers' and their clients' trust.\r\nThis implies some requirements that a lot of PRs don't initially meet.\r\n\r\nThis crate doesn't filter out \"ZIP bombs\" because extreme compression ratios and shallow file copies have legitimate uses; but\r\nI expect the tools the crate provides for checking that extraction is safe, such as the `ZipArchive::decompressed_size` method in\r\nhttps://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/blob/master/src/read.rs, to remain reliably effective. I also expect all the crate's methods to\r\nremain panic-free, so that this crate can be used on servers without creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThese are our requirements for PRs, in addition to the usual functionality and readability requirements:\r\n- This codebase sometimes changes rapidly. Please rebase your branch before opening a pull request, and \r\n  grant @Pr0methean write access to the source branch (so I can fix later conflicts without being subject \r\n  to the limitations of the web UI) if EITHER of the following apply:\r\n  - It has been at least 24 hours since you forked the repo or previously rebased the branch; or\r\n  - 5 or more pull requests are already open at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/pulls. PRs are merged in the order they become\r\n    eligible (reviewed, passing CI tests, and no conflicts with the base branch). I will attempt to fix merge\r\n    conflicts, but this is best-effort.\r\n- Please make sure your PR's target repo is `zip-rs/zip2` and not `zip-rs/zip-old`. The latter\r\n  repo is no longer maintained, and I will archive it after closing the pre-existing issues.\r\n- Your changes must build against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version.\r\n- PRs must pass all the checks specified in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, which include:\r\n  - Unit tests, run with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` AND with the default features, each run\r\n    against the MSRV (see README.md) AND the latest stable Rust version AND the latest nightly Rust version, on Windows, MacOS \r\n    AND Ubuntu (yes, that's a 3-dimensional matrix).\r\n  - `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo doc --no-deps` must pass with `--no-default-features` AND with `--all-features` \r\n    AND with the default features.\r\n  - `cargo fmt --check --all` must pass.\r\n- If the above checks force you to add a new `#[allow]` attribute, please place a comment on the same line or just above it, \r\n  explaining what the exception applies to and why it's needed.\r\n- The PR title must conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and start \r\n  with one of the types specified by the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\r\n  This is also recommended for commit messages; but it's not required, because they'll be replaced when the PR is squash-merged.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for submitting a bug fix or proposed feature that meets these requirements!\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
