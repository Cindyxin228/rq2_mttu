It is kind of like a mix of GNUmakefiles and Docker and prides itself as being write once, build everywhere. Earthly can also import Dockerfiles and you can depend on other Earthfiles.\r\n\r\nBy adding an Earthfile that depends on the Dockerfile, you allow downstream users to import it and follow updates to the Dockerfile without manual intervention required. Like in Github Actions, you can follow branches, tags or commits too.\r\n\r\nI use xwin for years now already and, so far, kept my Earthly-based repositories manually up-to-date. I would be very happy if I could automatically update in the future.\r\n\r\n# Technical Details\r\n\r\nEarthly is very similar to docker buildx and buildkit based. The `.earthlyignore` file uses the same syntax as dockerignore and gitignore and is there to reduce the scope of the build context.\r\n\r\nThe `Earthfile` can be anywhere inside the repository, as long as the `xwin.dockerfile` is located in the same or a subdirectory of the Earthfile. The build context will always be the same directory as the `Earthfile` and is only affected by the `.earthlyignore` located in the same directory as the `Earthfile`.\r\n\r\nSo it would be possible to create for example a `docker` folder inside the repository, put the `Earthfile` and `xwin.dockerfile` files inside it, and remove the `.earthlyignore`. That would be equivalent to the way I structured this PR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/121/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

client customization in the library, especially since it's reading environment variables which IMO is not something libraries should do in most cases.

for windows (defaults to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) wrapped in `strace` so that xwin can detect all file accesses to headers and libraries in the crt and sdk, and writing only those accessed files to a map file. This map file can then be used with a `splat` to _only_ splat and symlink the files listed in map file.\r\n\r\nThis results in a vastly smaller splat output eg. from 577 MiB -> 105 MiB for a large internal project that includes a significant amount of C/C++ code.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a `--sdk-version` and `--crt-version` so allow users to explicitly specify the sdk/crt to use, rather than the default behavior of always using the latest version detected in the manifest used. This was primarily done due to some CRT in the latest version required clang 16+, from the previous lowest version being 11, which can be too much of a jump for some people.\r\n\r\nResolves: #85\r\nResolves: #84\r\nResolves: #28", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99", "id": 1891879224, "node_id": "PR_kwDOF2eRFM5aGHv_", "number": 99, "title": "Default to manifest 17", "user": {"login": "Jake-Shadle", "id": 2316028, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTYwMjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316028?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-09-12T07:43:25Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-12T08:08:41Z", "closed_at": "2023-09-12T08:08:41Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pulls/99", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99.patch", "merged_at": "2023-09-12T08:08:40Z"}, "body": "This resolves an issue where there is _one_ (SIGH) file that exists in both the regular SDK headers and the Store headers.

added the setup from the blog / `xwin.dockerfile` locally to my `~/.cargo/config.toml` via `[env]` and `[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]`.  The `[env]` obviously only works for C/C++ code compiled within Rust / `cargo` projects and not system-wide, but for example setting `rustflags` via `[target.*]` allows it to be merged with other target-specific `rustflags` in project-specific `./.cargo/config.toml` rather than being mutually exlusive with the `RUSTFLAGS` env var: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildrustflags.

`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.BuildTools` package.\r\nA dependency with a CRT version is expected to begin with `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.` and end with `.x86.x64`.\r\nThe latest version is determined by string ordering.\r\nIn the current `17.4.1` version of the manifest, there is a dependency `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Modules.x86.x64`, so xwin determines that the latest CRT version is `Modules`.\r\n\r\nExecuting\r\n```\r\nxwin --accept-license --manifest-version=17 download\r\n```\r\ncauses an error\r\n```\r\nError: unable to find CRT headers item 'Microsoft.VC.Modules.CRT.Headers.base'\r\n```\r\nxwin can't find `Microsoft.VC.{crt_version}.CRT.Headers.base` package in the manifest because `{crt_version}` is `Modules`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Potential problem with string ordering\r\n\r\nString ordering might fail on some version numbers,\r\ne.g. if the dependencies are\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.15.9.x86.x64\r\nMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.15.10.x86.x64\r\n```\r\nthe latest version will be determined as `15.9`.\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/blob/5ece33c5df771221588faf6f5d81e59011ab1628/src/lib.rs#L522-L526>\r\nThe latest SDK version is also determined by string ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## List of existing versions from currently available manifests\r\n\r\nMight be useful to determine if changes from this pull request are needed.\r\nLooks like recent \"CRT version\" is just a concatenation of `14.*` real CRT version and manifest version (which matches Visual Studio version) and they usually increase simultaneously.\r\nString ordering might work if there will be no major CRT version increase.\r\n\r\n### CRT versions\r\n\r\n`15.9.51` manifest (matching
