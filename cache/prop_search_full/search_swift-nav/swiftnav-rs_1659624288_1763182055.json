"merged_at": "2025-09-19T20:23:31Z"}, "body": "One last refactor for usability. This PR contains two primary changes, along with a scattering of clean ups and documentation re-writes.\r\n\r\n# Support for handling new reference frames\r\n\r\nPreviously the `ReferenceFrame` enum contained a set list of known reference frames, and we made sure to maintain an internal list of transformations for that set list of reference frames. This approach is obviously pretty inflexible, so I've added a new variant to `ReferenceFrame` called `Other` to enable defining new reference frames at run-time. A `String` is used to represent the unknown reference frame types. This slots in easily with our use of the `strum` macros for converting the reference frame enums into or from strings, but this does make the `ReferenceFrame` type no longer triviably copy-able.\r\n\r\nI've attempted to reduce the number of clones of the new `ReferenceFrame`, but they can't be completely avoided without a significantly different approach of representing new reference frame types at run-time. I'd be happy to hear suggestions on alternative approaches if anyone has any.\r\n\r\n# Simplify managing reference frame transformations\r\n\r\nPreviously it was expected that the user of the crate would get the list of hard-coded transformations with the `get_transformation` function. If you needed a single transformation that would suffice, but if we didn't have a direct transformation hard-coded for you then you'd need to perform multiple transformations. The `TransformationGraph` struct was available to help to figure out the shortest path of transformations from one reference frame to another, but the `TransformationGraph` object didn't actually handle the transformations for you. In short it was a bit of a pain to use the crate for simple transformations and a major pain to do more complicated transformations.\r\n\r\nTo improve the situation I've replaced the old `TransformationGraph` type with a new `TransformationRepository` type which both maintains the graph of transformations and also applies multiple transformations for you in sequence when needed. You're able to easily get one pre-populated with the hard-coded transformations available, or an empty one, then add any additional transformations defined at run-time to the graph.", "reactions":

This one is a bit larger, mostly from the fact that the conversions in the C implementation are very inter-dependent and so several new bits of functionality were pulled in to make the Rust implementation mirror the C implementation. There's a few bits of functionality thrown out because they caused some significant unsoundness, but I'm sure there is still several bits of unsoundness in this translation (e.g. several panics/asserts are still present).

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/407\">#407</a>: <code>Display</code> is now correctly derived in <code>[no_std]</code> projects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/402\">#402</a>: <code>EnumIter</code> now implements <code>Send + Sync</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/400\">#400</a>: <code>EnumTryAs</code> now handles attributes on variant fields correctly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/398\">#398</a>: <code>strum</code> is now on rust 2021</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/391\">#391</a>: <code>EnumProperties</code> correctly implements <code>get_bool</code> and <code>get_int</code>\nfinally. \ud83c\udf89</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/380\">#380</a>: <code>FromString</code> now supports 2 additional attributes, <code>parse_error_ty</code>\nand <code>parse_error_fn</code> that can be added to use a custom error type rather than the default strum error message.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/410\">#410</a>: These attributes accept a <code>Path</code> rather than a <code>String</code>\nto improve behavior with rust-analyzer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/384\">#384</a>: MSRV is now 1.66.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/391\">#391</a>: <code>EnumProperties</code> doesn't provide default implementations anymore.\nThis would have required you to manually implement this trait which should be very uncommon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.26.4 (strum_macros)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/360\">#360</a>: Fixes bug introduced with new string interpolation feature where\nunit structs took an implicit unnecessary dependency on <code>::core::alloc</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.26.3 (strum_macros)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/344\">#344</a>: Hide <code>EnumTable</code> because it's going to be deprecated in the next\nversion.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/357\">#357</a>: Fixes an incompatiblity with <code>itertools</code> by using the fully\nqualified name rather than the inherent method.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/345\">#345</a>: Allows unnamed tuple like variants to use their variants in\nstring interpolation. <code>#[strum(to_string = &quot;Field 0: {0}, Field 1: {1})&quot;)]</code> will now work for tuple variants</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.26.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/337\">#337</a>: Fix missing generic impls for <code>EnumTryAs</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/334\">#334</a>: Support prefix in <code>AsRefStr</code>. Technically a breaking change,\nbut <code>prefix</code> was just added in <code>0.26.0</code> so it's a newer feature and it makes the feature more consisent in general.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.26.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/325\">#325</a>: use <code>core</code> instead of <code>std</code> in VariantArray.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.26.0</h2>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>EnumVariantNames</code> macro has been renamed <code>VariantNames</code>. The deprecation warning should steer you in</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

<code>ParseCallbacks::header_file</code> callback which runs on every filename passed to <code>Builder::header</code>.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>CargoCallbacks::new</code> constructor which emits a cargo-rerun line\nfor every input header file by default.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>CargoCallbacks::rerun_on_header_files</code> method to configure whether\na cargo-rerun line should be emitted for every input header file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>--wrap-static-fns</code> feature was updated so function types that has no\nargument use <code>void</code> as its sole argument.</li>\n<li><code>CargoCallbacks</code> is no longer a <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/structs.html\">unit-like\nstruct</a> and the\n<code>CargoCallbacks</code> constant was added to mitigate the breaking nature of this\nchange. This constant has been marked as deprecated and users will have to\nuse the new <code>CargoCallbacks::new</code> method in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<h2>Fixed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow compiling <code>bindgen-cli</code> with a static libclang.</li>\n<li>Emit an opaque integer type for pointer types that don't have the same size\nas the target's pointer size.</li>\n<li>Avoid escaping Objective-C method names unless they are <code>Self</code>, <code>self</code>,\n<code>crate</code> or <code>super</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<h1>0.68.1</h1>\n<h2>Fixed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed errors on the windows artifact build process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.68.0</h1>\n<h2>Added</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>system</code> ABI is now supported as an option for the <code>--override-abi</code> flag.</li>\n<li>The <code>allowlist_item</code> method and the <code>--allowlist-item</code> flag have been\nincluded to filter items regardless or their kind.</li>\n<li>Include installers as release artifacts on Github.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Clone</code> implementation for <code>_BindgenUnionField</code> has been changed to pass\nthe <code>incorrect_clone_impl_on_copy_type</code> Clippy lint.</li>\n<li>The <code>c_unwind</code> ABI can be used without a feature gate for any Rust target version\nequal to or greater than 1.71.\nThis comes as a result of the ABI being stabilised (in Rust 1.71).</li>\n<li>Formatting changes when using prettyplease as a formatter due to a new\nprettyplease version.</li>\n<li>Avoid generating invalid <code>CStr</code> constants when using the <code>--generate-cstr</code>\noption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>extra_assert</code> and <code>extra_assert_eq</code> macros are no longer exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixed</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

CLI.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>--experimental</code> flag on <code>bindgen-cli</code> and the <code>experimental</code>\nfeature on <code>bindgen</code> to gate experimental features whose implementation is\nincomplete or are prone to change in a non-backwards compatible manner.</li>\n<li>Added a new set of flags and their equivalent builder methods\n<code>--wrap-static-fns</code>, <code>--wrap-static-fns-suffix</code> and <code>--wrap-static-fns-path</code>\nto generate C function wrappers for <code>static</code> or <code>static inline</code> functions.\nThis feature is experimental.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed name collisions when having a C <code>enum</code> and a <code>typedef</code> with the same\nname.</li>\n<li>The <code>ParseCallbacks::generated_name_override</code> method now receives <code>ItemInfo&lt;'_&gt;</code> as\nargument instead of a <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated the <code>clang-sys</code> crate version to 1.4.0 to support clang 15.</li>\n<li>The return type is now ommited in signatures of functions returning <code>void</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated the <code>clap</code> dependency for <code>bindgen-cli</code> to 4.</li>\n<li>Rewrote the <code>bindgen-cli</code> argument parser which could introduce unexpected\nbehavior changes.</li>\n<li>The <code>ParseCallbacks::add_derives</code> method now receives <code>DeriveInfo&lt;'_&gt;</code> as\nargument instead of a <code>&amp;str</code>. This type also includes the kind of target type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<h2>Fixed</h2>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<h1>0.63.0</h1>\n<h2>Added</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>new feature: <code>process_comments</code> method to the <code>ParseCallbacks</code> trait to\nhandle source code comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only wrap unsafe operations in unsafe blocks if the <code>--wrap_unsafe_ops</code>\noption is enabled.</li>\n<li>Replace the <code>name: &amp;str</code> argument for <code>ParseCallbacks::add_derives</code> by\n<code>info: DeriveInfo</code>.</li>\n<li>All the rust targets equal or lower than <code>1.30</code> are being deprecated and\nwill be removed in the future.
