I can't say does it make sense for you to merge this or should we rename mine to be `tokio-fcm` and me authoring this new library. I pretty much broke the API here so it's a major change.\r\n\r\nWe've been pushing huge amount of notifications with this library and the not-yet-released `tokio-hyper`. We could be faster if not allocating so much, but that has not been an issue for us yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, are you still maintaining your branch?\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is\u2002[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/panicbit/fcm-rust/1)\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/panicbit/fcm-rust/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/panicbit/fcm-rust/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
