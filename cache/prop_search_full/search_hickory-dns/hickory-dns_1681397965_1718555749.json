following command\r\n``` console\r\ngit subtree add -P conformance https://github.com/ferrous-systems/dnssec-tests main\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then proceeds to set up CI and CODEOWNERS as proposed in [this comment](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pull/2155#issuecomment-2083288096)\r\n\r\nthe first ~159 commits are the git history of the dnssec-tests repository. the last few commits correspond to the integration work\r\n\r\nI considered adding the new two packages to the existing workspace but that resulted in more invasive changes to the `justfile`: we don't want to run the conformance test suite whenever `cargo ws exec cargo t` is used because we want to set the test subject via an environment variable and we also want to run the conformance test suite against different DNS implementations. I didn't find a straightforward way to merge the `ignore` justfile arguments that some tasks have to a default `--ignore='{dns-test,conformance-tests}'` argument which had to be added to each `cargo ws exec` invocation. Instead, I opted for placing the conformance test suite and its test framework into its own workspace; that led to less invasive changes to the `justfile`.\r\n\r\nNote that the creation of the CODEOWNERS file is not sufficient to achieve the desired review permissions. The ferrous team need to be given write permissions to this repository and the branch protection settings of this repository need to modified to \"Require review from Code Owners\" as described in [this help article](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#codeowners-and-branch-protection)\r\n\r\n~~I'm going to leave this PR in draft state because I need to redo the \"subtree pull\" after https://github.com/ferrous-systems/dnssec-tests/pull/67 has been merged because that un-ignores the tests that pass with the latest version of hickory-dns ( 107635c6c5934524894736f1b141198d0fa62fec )~~ DONE", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2222/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2222/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2218", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2218/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2218/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2218/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pull/2218", "id": 2308043857, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAmhKGM5wEebf", "number": 2218, "title": "Remove broken mtls code to fix CI", "user": {"login": "djc", "id": 158471, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ3MQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158471?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc", "html_url": "https://github.com/djc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djc/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2024-05-21T11:14:35Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T07:26:24Z", "closed_at": "2024-05-21T17:24:01Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pulls/2218", "html_url": "https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pull/2218", "diff_url": "https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pull/2218.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/pull/2218.patch", "merged_at": "2024-05-21T17:24:01Z"}, "body": "Nightly Rust started warning about undefined features, which broke CI:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/actions/runs/9172380557/job/25219060007\r\n\r\nThe `mtls` feature seems to have been added in a broken state in #117 and has never since been fixed.

3.2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-3.2.1): the DO bit is set in the queries the recursive resolver sends on behalf of the client. On the wire, I can see that the name servers it communicates with include extra DNSSEC records in their response to the resolver. However, the `Recursor` removes those extra DNSSEC records before answering the client. That stripping of DNSSEC records does the opposite of the second half of what the RFC dictates (when the DO bit is set).\r\n\r\nAFAICT, the stripping of those DNSSEC records happens [here](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/blob/6334a01430088ead8642cafaee592ec7bf49831f/crates/recursor/src/recursor.rs#L324). That function caches all the received records but only responds with the ones that *exactly* match the query and as DNSSEC records like RRSIG were not included in the original query it discards them.\r\n\r\nI still have to figure out how to best avoid stripping so I'm leaving this as a draft PR for now.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm checking conformance with the tests in https://github.com/ferrous-systems/dnssec-tests/pull/53\r\n\r\ncc #2193 ", "reactions": {"url":

of my app, I found that the test failed due to the IP of `example.com` being changed and also discovered that hickory dns has the same issue. So I proceeded to take the following steps to fix the test.\r\n\r\n1. Change IPv4: from `93.184.216.34` to `93.184.215.14`\r\n2. Change IPv6: from `2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946` to `2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c`\r\n\r\nI searched for all occurrences and replaced them until `cargo test` is passed. And I'm unsure whether I need to do anything more for the tests that run locally. For example, https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/blob/76a4b84216fa4984eafd4c4ceb5f0892ae3edbbf/tests/integration-tests/tests/sqlite_authority_tests.rs#L55\r\n\r\nReference: Here is another repo that fixed this issues 1d ago https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/pull/17894\r\n\r\nI hope you can review it patiently, as there are many files involved in the changes. Thank you. Additionally, do we need to add a global variable or environment variable to handle future IP changes?", "reactions": {"url":

downstream in Rustls.\r\n\r\n* Updates SVCB/HTTPS related code to cite RFC 9460. Existing text that was copied from an earlier draft is updated with the matching RFC text.\r\n* Corrects the ECH service parameter key, RFC 9460 specifies using `\"ech\"`, where as hickory was using `\"echconfig\"`.\r\n* Renames the ECH SVCB/HTTPS types from `EchConfig` to `EchConfigList` to better emphasize that the returned value's wire-encoding is a TLS-encoded `ECHConfigList`, as specified in [draft-ietf-tls-esni-18 \u00a74](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-18#section-4).\r\n* Switches the held representation of the `EchConfigList` to be the wire-encoding, removing pre-processing that stripped the TLS encoded list length prefix. Downstream users will have an easier time with this based on existing TLS list decoding capabilities inherit to a TLS implementation. Similarly, the BASE64 presentation format is updated to encode the wire-encoded value with the prefixed length.

store that has no trust anchors, return an early error. This makes the problem obvious and avoids surfacing some other less specific error cause when we first try to validate a peer certificate with an empty root store.\r\n\r\nIn order for our new early error to be surfaced correctly the `name_sever_pool.rs` [`parallel_conn_loop` fn](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/blob/6c2a1e2c238eaecff2b6b6c1c0e435685bc0997e/crates/resolver/src/name_server/name_server_pool.rs#L304-L392) needs its error handling adjusted. Previously it would always compare the new error produced by trying to build the TLS config against [the default error](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/blob/6c2a1e2c238eaecff2b6b6c1c0e435685bc0997e/crates/resolver/src/name_server/name_server_pool.rs#L312) it starts its loop with, `ProtoErrorKind::NoConnections`. Since the error being returned is another `ProtoErrorKind` that isn't `NoRecordsFound`, `Io`, or `Timeout` the error specificity comparison considers the two errors equivalent [in the general case](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/blob/6c2a1e2c238eaecff2b6b6c1c0e435685bc0997e/crates/proto/src/error.rs#L487), and the default error was always returned and the new error thrown away.\r\n\r\n~There is still a small mystery around why a more specific error from tokio-rustls isn't returned when peer validation inevitably fails. In my testing upstream we get a nice `io::Error` like `err: Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: InvalidCertificate(UnknownIssuer) }`. I can't figure out where or why, but something in the Hickory DNS stack is reducing this down to just a simple io error with type `InvalidData` - no nested source error or message.~ See [my comment here](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/issues/2066#issuecomment-2053743003) I think this is a side-effect of the `Clone` impl on `ProtoErrorKind`.\r\n\r\nUpdates

href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/releases\">codecov/codecov-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>v4 of the Codecov Action uses the <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/the-codecov-cli\">CLI</a> as the underlying upload. The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Codecov Action runs as a <code>node20</code> action due to <code>node16</code> deprecation. See <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/\">this post from GitHub</a> on how to migrate.</li>\n<li>Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>v3</code> versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).</p>\n<h2>What's

`reap_tasks` function could cause a tokio task to spinloop.\r\n\r\nThis is because `FutureExt::now_or_never` returns an Option<T> where T is the inner future's resolution type. If `join_set.join_next()` returned None, indicating there are no longer tasks to join, the `FutureExt::now_or_never` would return `Some(None)`.\r\n\r\nThen, the `is_some()` spinloop in this function would see the `Some(None)` and busy loop calling `FutureExt::now_or_never`.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to use `Option::flatten` to transform the nested Option. Now, the call to `reap_tasks` will only loop when the inner `join_set.join_next` returns `Some(..)`, indicating that a task is already complete. When there are no tasks complete, or when the `JoinSet` is empty and returns `None`, the `reap_tasks` function will immediately yield.", "reactions": {"url":

changes from #1943 into two parts. This is the first part, only introducing loading the native certificates. The changes are basically only touching the code that was loading certificates from `webpki-roots` and introducing the new crate features.\r\n\r\nI could split this up further into `trust-dns-proto` and `trust-dns-resolver`?\r\n\r\nThis implementation has the big downside that `trust-dns-resolver` will attempt to load the native certificates only once and save the `Result` in a `Lazy`. So there currently no way for the user to re-attempt or reload the native certificates.
