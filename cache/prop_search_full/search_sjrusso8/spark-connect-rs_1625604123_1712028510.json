Description\r\n\r\n**feat**: restructure existing modules, and add Column, Expression, and Functions modules\r\n\r\n* refactor existing modules to mirror the pyspark connector layout\r\n* move logic plan creation into the `plan` module and out of the `dataframe` module\r\n* create an `expression` module to handle `Expression` creation\r\n* create `Column` struct as a representation of a `Column` object\r\n     * add traits for `alias` and `name`\r\n* create `functions` module containing the first workings of pyspark functions \r\n     * add functions for `col`, `pi`, and `coalesce` \r\n* **breaking change** the `select()` trait now only excepts `Vec<Column>`\r\n     * tests and examples are updated to match the change   \r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nShare links to useful
