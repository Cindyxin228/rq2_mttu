Clarify that `rand` is a community project without any legally-binding guarantees\r\n2. Better document potential suitability of `rand` components where security/unpredictability are important\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit no. 2 because more people are now seeing this.\r\n\r\n`rand` contains no high-level cryptographic functionality, e.g. no encryption or signing support. It doesn't even contain a dedicated password generator (though you can pretty easily generate random strings with [`Alphanumeric`](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/distr/struct.Alphanumeric.html)).\r\n\r\nFor example, we've had people assume that `ThreadRng` had full fork protection (it previously offered a very limited form of fork protection which the docs were clear about to anyone who actually read them), then complain that it didn't function as expected. So now we've \"resolved\" this by removing all fork protection but adding some instructions to people who need it.\r\n\r\nFurther, various people expect cryptographic primitives to zero their contents on drop (`zeroize`). `ThreadRng` does not do this, and at this point it's unclear if it ever will (`StdRng` may do so in the future, but we can't guarantee that `ThreadRng` will, in part because of Rust's lack of guarantees about what happens on thread destruction). `ThreadRng` has *always* been a compromise between being an unpredictable generator and being *fast* (it also uses considerably more memory than something like `SmallRng`, though also far less than it did in the distant past).\r\n\r\nI would prefer the project under-promise than over-promise when it comes to security. In particular, this means that anyone using `rand`'s functionality in a security-sensitive context needs to do their homework: what are their requirements and is `getrandom` / `OsRng` / `ThreadRng` aka `rand::rng()` appropriate for the job?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1514/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

means that `TryRngCore`/`TryCryptoRng` no longer can have blanket impls for `&mut R` and `Box<R>`.

`SeedableRng::Seed`.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nSimply put: it's already possible to clone these seeds based upon the bounds already provided, but it's *really annoying* without a proper `Clone` bound. You can just as easily create a new one with `Default` and write all of the data from the old seed into the new one with `AsMut`, but this now requires me to do this explicitly instead of just being able to `derive(Clone)` on a struct that contains a seed.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nThis is also a breaking change, but I don't think people will have a problem including it in the next breaking release.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1491/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1491/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1490", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1490/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1490/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1490/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1490", "id": 2494255924, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAc09Ts550sFy", "number": 1490, "title": "Migrate remaining benchmarks to Criterion", "user": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-08-29T12:08:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-06T08:09:01Z", "closed_at": "2024-09-06T08:07:48Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/pulls/1490", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1490", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1490.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1490.patch", "merged_at": "2024-09-06T08:07:48Z"}, "body": "- [ ] Added a `CHANGELOG.md` entry\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nTranslate everything still using the old test harness to Criterion.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nRemove dependency on the (mostly deprecated) standard test harness. Enable usage of Criterion command-line arguments (which are otherwise intercepted by the Rust test harness).\r\n\r\nCloses #1039.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nMostly these are straightforward translations or simplifications (Criterion can benchmark ~1ns functions well enough so we don't need 1000 repetitions inside our benchmark functions).\r\n\r\nSome I have added to benchmark groups. Some I have used shorter warmup/measurement durations since the defaults are quite conservative.\r\n\r\nMany of the new results match up very well with those from the old test framework. Others don't; in particular the `generators` benchmarks (especially byte benches) are notably slower, but vaguely the same relative performance.\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Old generators benchmark

originally proposed several new helpers:\r\n\r\n* `gen_range`\r\n* `fill`\r\n* `gen_bool`/`gen_ratio`\r\n* `choose`/`choose_mut`\r\n* `shuffle`\r\n\r\nAs I started playing with implementing these, I narrowed it down to two functions that seemed the most useful/obvious to me:\r\n\r\n* `range`: The helper I most frequently wish I had. A flexible way to get a random float or an index into a slice. A \"pit of success\" around the `random::<usize>() % len` mistake. Good integration with Rust's native range syntax. Renamed from `gen_range`, mainly because it's more convenient to type/read, and also to give more space to the upcoming `gen` keyword.\r\n* `shuffle`: An obvious/straightforward API. Useful in small examples, tests, etc. \r\n\r\nIn my mind, the case for these others is less compelling:\r\n\r\n* `fill`: The most common use case might be generating 128-bit or 256-bit seeds/keys, but `random()` already works for arrays up to size 32.\r\n* `gen_bool`: Also doable by comparing a float to `random()`, and that alternative might be easier to read.\r\n* `choose`: Useful, but you want two or three different variants (`&T`, and `&mut T`, and maybe `T: Copy`).

ensuring that we emulate a closed range by excluding `high` from the result.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nFix #1299.\r\n\r\nAdditional motivation: floating-point types are approximations of continuous (real) numbers. Although one might expect that `rng.gen_range(0f32..1f32)` is strictly less than `1f32`, it can also be seen as an approximation of the real range `[0, 1)` which includes values whose nearest approximation under `f32` is `1f32`.\r\n\r\nIn general, one can always expect that floating-point numbers may round up/down to the nearest representable value, hence this change is not expected to affect many users.\r\n\r\n`sample_single` was changed (see below) as a simplification, and to match the new behaviour of `new`.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nSpecific to floats (i.e. `UniformFloat`),\r\n\r\n- `new` sets `scale = high - low` (unchanged) then ensures that `low + scale * max_rand <= high` (previously: ensure `< high`)\r\n- `new_inclusive` sets `scale = (high - low) / (1 - \u03b5)` then ensures that `low + scale * max_rand <= high` (unchanged)\r\n- `sample_single` is now equivalent to `sample_single_inclusive` (previously: use rejection sampling to ensure `sample < high`)\r\n- `sample_single_inclusive` is unchanged: it yields `low + (high-low) * Standard.samgle(rng)`\r\n\r\nNote: `new` attempts to ensure that `high` may be yielded; `sample_single_inclusive` does not.

PR is an alternative solution to the same problem. If this PR is merged, the other can be closed.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nPlease read the motivation section in https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1403. This PR aims to solve the problem mentioned there by exposing insights into the current state of the distribution, allowing the end user to calculate new weights based on the current values and then call the existing `update_weights` method with those.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nThree new methods have been added to `weighted_index.rs`. Here are their signatures:\r\n\r\n`weights` returns a `WeightedIndexIter` which iterates over all the weights in the distribution:\r\n```rust\r\npub fn weights(&self) -> WeightedIndexIter<'_, X>\r\n    where\r\n        X: for<'a> ::core::ops::SubAssign<&'a X>\r\n            + Clone\r\n```\r\n\r\n`weight` returns the weight at a specific index:\r\n```rust\r\npub fn weight(&self, index: usize) -> Option<X>\r\n    where \r\n        X: for<'a> ::core::ops::SubAssign<&'a X>\r\n            + Clone\r\n```\r\n\r\n`total_weight` returns the sum of all weights:\r\n```rust\r\npub fn total_weight(&self) -> X\r\n    where X: Clone\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my opinion these methods are also not strongly coupled with the current implementation of `WeightedIndex`, as I cannot imagine a future implementation which would not be able to support these operations.\r\n\r\nI have also added tests for the new methods.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reviews :)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1420/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1420/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1417", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1417/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1417/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1417/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1417", "id": 2202411696, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAc09Ts5qe-Vl", "number": 1417, "title": "Cleaner README, remove MSRV shields", "user": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2024-03-22T12:41:28Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-25T14:56:18Z", "closed_at": "2024-03-25T14:56:18Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/pulls/1417", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1417", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1417.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/1417.patch", "merged_at": "2024-03-25T14:56:18Z"}, "body": "- Inherit several package fields from the workspace.

Use inherent fns instead.\r\n- Fix `Seed` type for `StdRng` (the only practical effect is to make a possible future breaking change to the API more obvious).\r\n\r\nLoss of functionality:\r\n\r\n- `SmallRng` can no longer be used in generics requiring a `SeedableRng` bound. As such, it can also no longer be reseeded from generic code. Is this an issue?\r\n- There is no public `SmallRng::from_seed` function. This is deliberate since most *useful* uses require a portable RNG.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1368/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1368/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
