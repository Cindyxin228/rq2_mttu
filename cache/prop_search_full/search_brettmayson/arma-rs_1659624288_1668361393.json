commands to return: `Result<(), E>`, `Result<T, ()>` and `Result<(), ()>`. \r\nThe way in which this PR achieves that is by implementing the `IntoExtResult` trait to each result containing a `()` and in those implementations `()` is converted to an empty string. This PR also adds a check in `write_cstr` to skip empty strings.\r\n\r\nAn other way this could be done is by adding the `IntoArma` trait to `()` instead of adding multiple `IntoExtResult`. Since all functions return `()` implicitly (when `-> ...` isn't specified) this would also mean that every command technically returns an empty string and therefor the two command handler's dealing with no returns can be removed. \r\nI included a commit (and reverted it) containing this solution, I feel it might be to general to implement `IntoArma` on `()` but wanted to bring it up in discussion anyway. I'd love to hear your thoughts about it: https://github.com/BrettMayson/arma-rs/commit/2a8a566cc26404d76b11902a56b3c20d2691cd6d", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/BrettMayson/arma-rs/issues/28/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/BrettMayson/arma-rs/issues/28/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
