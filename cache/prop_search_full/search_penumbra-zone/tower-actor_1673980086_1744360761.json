The original code uses `anyhow` + `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static>` to erase all error information but this didn't feel like the right approach for a library. I ended up going with [sled's](http://sled.rs/errors.html) approach of returning a `Result<Result<S, E>, ActorError>` to capture the difference between unrecoverable queue errors and theoretically recoverable consumer errors. This also required me to make the actual ActorFuture itself an enum, to capture the case where the queue was closed between `poll_ready()` and `call()`.
