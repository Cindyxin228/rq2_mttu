This does not happen. Instead I found that calling `waker.wake()` for task A actually wakes task B.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to wrap my head around why it works that way and doesn't deadlock. Whatever the reason for that behavior is. It's a memory leak nonetheless.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Astro36/qp/issues/3/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Astro36/qp/issues/3/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
