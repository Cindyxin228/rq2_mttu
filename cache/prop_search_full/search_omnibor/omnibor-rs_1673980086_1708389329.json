from one designed to fit the largest\r\npossible hash algorithm _supported_ by the crate regardless of the\r\nactual hash algorithm used in a specific case, to one that is sized\r\nto have exactly the space needed for the selected hash algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis involves a little bit more complexity than I'd like, because Rust's\r\nconst-generics support is still incomplete and thus this crate\r\nrelies on the `generic_array` crate to provide what we need. In the\r\nfuture we'd replace this with normal const-generic arrays which\r\nwould (hopefully) also simplify the bounds on the generic types.\r\n\r\nThis commit does not complete the work for this transition, as it\r\ndoes not address fixing the FFI story. The FFI module is commented\r\nout, and will need to be updated before this can be merged.\r\n\r\nThis commit _does_ remove the finder API. After consideration,\r\nI think the current API for finding matching GitOids is both too\r\ncomplicated in terms of trait bounds AND under-powered in terms\r\nof controlling matching behavior. It may not even make sense to\r\nproscribe _how_ matching can be performed on a scale beyond\r\n\"check object against GitOid\" given the complexities of performance\r\ntuning which are possible.\r\n\r\nA fun note on sizing, in the prior code the size of a GitOid was fairly\r\nlarge, as the GitOid type had to store two 4 byte enums (HashAlgorithm\r\nand ObjectType) plus a \"usize\" (usually 4 bytes), and a 32-byte buffer.\r\nSo it would generally be 52 bytes.\r\n\r\nIn the new code, for SHA-256, GitOids are 33 bytes (1 byte for the\r\nObjectType, and 32 bytes for the buffer), and for SHA-1 GitOids are\r\n21 bytes (1 byte for the ObjectType, 20 bytes for the buffer). Given that\r\nwe expect code using GitOids in OmniBOR to be using large numbers of\r\nthem, this size saving is great news!\r\n\r\nFixes #82.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/90/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/90/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/88", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/88/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/88/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/88/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/88", "id": 2108926586, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG5Dh085lgkjU", "number": 88, "title": "feat: first draft of README rewrite", "user": {"login": "alilleybrinker", "id": 1223605, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM2MDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223605?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker", "html_url": "https://github.com/alilleybrinker", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alilleybrinker/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-01-30T22:41:45Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-13T23:46:52Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-13T23:46:52Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pulls/88", "html_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/88", "diff_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/88.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/88.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-13T23:46:52Z"}, "body": "This commit rewrites the README to more clearly explain\nthe background and goals of OmniBOR and of the Rust\nimplementation.\n\nRight now it delegates info to crate-specific\nREADMEs which haven't been written yet.

information, and removes the \"adding `NUM_HASH_BYTES`\" material which, as far as I can tell, is no longer required (at least, running `cbindgen` on the hosts I have on hand always include `NUM_HASH_BYTES` automatically).\r\n- More generally, rewrites the language to be clearer about what this project is and what benefits it is intended to offer in the software supply chain

the matching `GitOid` itself, along with reporting any errors that arise when resolving the new `GitOid`s.\r\n\r\nThe docs for the `Finder` struct spell it out the clearest. This design is centered around the new `IntoIdentifiedGitOid` trait, which is implemented for a variety of existing types. The goal of this is to allow the `Finder` to be generic over things which produce `GitOid`s, so that, for example, someone could add a mechanism to resolve `GitOid`s from a `Url` without changing any existing code.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Lilley Brinker <alilleybrinker@gmail.com>", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/45/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/45/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/41", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/41/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/41/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/41/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/41", "id": 1442977586, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG5Dh085CklYK", "number": 41, "title": "Nell/feat/ffi", "user": {"login": "nellshamrell", "id": 813007, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzAwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813007?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell", "html_url": "https://github.com/nellshamrell", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nellshamrell/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-11-10T00:11:10Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T19:09:16Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-17T22:57:42Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pulls/41", "html_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/41", "diff_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/41.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/pull/41.patch", "merged_at": "2023-01-17T22:57:42Z"}, "body": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/41/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/omnibor/omnibor-rs/issues/41/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
