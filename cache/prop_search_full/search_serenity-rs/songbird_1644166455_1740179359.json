scale:\r\n\r\n* In unknown circumstances, we can be left with adjacent packets queued which have very different timestamps. The playout buffer would withhold its held packets, leading to the loss of many subsequent packets if the timestamp jump is larger than 64 frames. This seems to occur for some specific clients which join before a bot, suggesting the DAVE -> legacy switchover is involved.\r\n* Some loss patterns can leave us unable to correctly track the next expected sequence number (i.e., large loss runs), leaving the playout buffer unable to accept any packets if the packet sequence differed by over 64 entries.\r\n\r\nThe fixes are fallbacks which treat sufficiently large desynchronisation, and allow the playout to get back into a consistent state in both cases. Large timestamp jumps on adjacent packets now update the next expected TS (noting that we only want to withhold a few playout delays at most ). Failure to insert 0.25s of packets (or attempting to add a new sequence number into an empty buffer) can now take precedence.\r\n\r\nCloses #261.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/266/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/266/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/265", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/265/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/265/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/265/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird/pull/265", "id": 2660171973, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEqGtJM6B-iaX", "number": 265, "title": "Receive: Config of decode sample rate/channels", "user": {"login": "FelixMcFelix", "id": 6815381, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTUzODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6815381?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/FelixMcFelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FelixMcFelix/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-11-14T21:56:29Z", "updated_at": "2024-11-16T19:09:45Z", "closed_at": "2024-11-16T11:57:53Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/pulls/265", "html_url": "https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird/pull/265", "diff_url": "https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird/pull/265.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird/pull/265.patch", "merged_at": "2024-11-16T11:57:53Z"}, "body": "This PR allows for dynamic configuration of the output sample rate and channel count of received Opus audio.

Tasks are dynamically promoted and demoted based on whether they have any live audio tracks. This adds in some other niceties like preventing packet buffer reallocations, where possible. I intend to add reclamation of packet buffers, worker threads, and offloading expensive tasks to other threads.\r\n\r\nThis defaults to grouping 16 live calls per thread, mainly to prevent issues with users not compiling in release mode and/or using weaker machines. This can be configured during `Config` creation, and should be tuned for users at scale -- for instance, a passthrough-only workload can serve up to ~660 calls per thread on a Ryzen 5700X.\r\n\r\nTo put this in context, if all calls are live, this defaults to a 16x reduction in the amount of threads used. If only 30% of calls are live, the remainder all go in a single async task, giving an asymptotic 53x reduction of thread count.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Cleanup & document the draft implementation\r\n- [x] Fix Benchmarks to account for scheduler\r\n- [x] Integrate testing of scheduler behaviours into harness\r\n- [x] Periodically reclaim threads and packet blocks\r\n- [x] Update ARCHITECTURE.md",

processing (i.e., one day eliminating ffmpeg).\r\n\r\n- [x] Audiopus-based Symphonia codec and DCA1 framing.\r\n- [x] Ensure that Opus packet passthrough can be performed through Symphonia.\r\n- [x] Port mixing infrastructure (and packet passthrough).\r\n- [x] Rework `input` interface.\r\n- [x] Implement basic DASH handling for youtube and other multimedia handlers extracted from youtube-dl.\r\n- [ ] Investigate upstreaming MKV support to Symphonia.\r\n- [x] Port our stream-cacheing wrappers to this ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThere will be some slight issues stemming from the fact that we will now be parsing metadata from bytestreams as they arrive:\r\n* How will metadata be accessible to users before it enters the mixer? Is this just a `spawn_blocking` on the initial `Format` parse phase? Pass messages out from the main mixer context?\r\n* Users will need to be able to both pass in raw `MediaSourceStream`s, `Read`s, *and* fully processed `(Format, Metadata, ...)` sets -- due to the above, and as some extra metadata will *only* be exposed by youtube-dl, for instance.\r\n* Until MKV support is impl'd, we'll probably need to peek at bytes internally and pass over to ffmpeg on a decode failure. Having such a fallback should probably be toggleable.\r\n* We'll probably need to offer one or two wrappers to hand over `AsyncRead`s into the mixing system (as well as automating extension/MIME type extraction from `File`s or HTTP responses).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/89/reactions", "total_count": 10, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 8, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/89/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
