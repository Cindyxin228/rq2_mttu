These additions provide a flexible way to represent and format timestamps in messages within the Serenity framework.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Added `FormattedTimestamp` struct to represent a combination of a timestamp and a formatting style.\r\n- Introduced `FormattedTimestampStyle` enum to define various styles for formatting time in messages.\r\n- Implemented relevant traits for ease of use, including `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Debug`, `Hash`, `Display`, and parsing from strings.\r\n- Included methods for creating instances, accessing timestamp and style, and displaying formatted time strings.\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n\r\n#### Creating a FormattedTimestamp instance:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse your_crate_name::{FormattedTimestamp, FormattedTimestampStyle, Timestamp};\r\n\r\nlet timestamp = Timestamp::now();\r\nlet message_time = FormattedTimestamp::new(timestamp, Some(FormattedTimestampStyle::ShortDateTime));\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Displaying formatted time string:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", message_time); // Outputs: <t:timestamp:f>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Parsing from a string:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet time_str = \"<t:timestamp:f>\";\r\nlet parsed_time: Result<FormattedTimestamp, FormattedTimestampParseError> = time_str.parse();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Related Issue\r\n\r\nCloses: #2480  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nIncluded comprehensive tests covering the functionality of `FormattedTimestamp` and `FormattedTimestampStyle`.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThis feature addresses the request raised in issue #2480, providing enhanced functionality for formatting timestamps in messages.\r\n\r\nPlease review and provide feedback.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you!", "reactions": {"url":

icon/unicode_emoji.\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nIn both `serenity/current` and `serenity/next` all `EditRole` fields are skipped when they are `None`. This does not work for `EditRole::icon` and `EditRole::unicode_emoji` because the field being `undefined` is different from the field being `null` at the API[^1]: if the field is `undefined` it will be kept unchanged, and if it is `null` it will be cleared. \r\n\r\nThe existing code then doesn't actually clear the icon/unicode_emoji when setting the other, but simply keeps it unchanged. \r\n\r\n### The solution\r\nWith a double Option it is possible to distinguish `undefined` from `null` from a set value. This is the [canonical](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/984#issuecomment-314143738) solution using serde (the example shows de-serialization but it works the same in reverse).\r\n\r\nThen, `None` is \"keep field unchanged\", `Some(None)` is \"clear this field\" and `Some(Some(value)` is \"set this field to this value\"\r\n\r\n### API breaks\r\n- `EditRole::unicode_emoji()` takes a `Option<String>` instead of `impl Into<String>`.\r\n- `EditRole::icon()` takes a `Option<&CreateAttachment>` instead of `&CreateAttachment`\r\n\r\n### Verified\r\n* `EditRole::icon(Some(...))` sets the icon and clears the Unicode emoji. \r\n* `EditRole::icon(None)` clears both icon and Unicode emoji.\r\n* `EditRole::unicode_emoji(Some(...))` sets the Unicode emoji and clears the icon.\r\n* `EditRole::unicode_emoji(None)` clears both Unicode emoji and icon.\r\n* `cargo +nightly fmt --all` and `cargo test --all` pass.\r\n\r\n### Other stuff\r\nFor more control it would be possible now to remove the automatic clearing of the unicode_emoji/icon in `icon()`/`unicode_emoji()`, but I didn't see any real use-cases for this.\r\n\r\n[^1]: \"All parameters to this endpoint are optional and

To avoid breaking backcompat, I added them back, but serenity does not rely on all of them. Nothing relies on `PartialOrd`/`Ord`, and only the `Permissions` and `SpeakingState` types rely on `Hash`/`PartialEq`/`Eq`. The common required traits are just `Copy`/`Clone` and `Debug`.

message](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#start-thread-without-message).

In a future API version this will be changed to be a required field, with no default.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is a misunderstanding of the docs. They say \u201cdefaults to `PRIVATE_THREAD`\u201d, not \u201cmust be `PRIVATE_THREAD`\u201d.
