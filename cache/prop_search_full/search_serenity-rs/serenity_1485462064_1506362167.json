I also ended up using [this PR](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs/pull/68) that was mentioned in that issue as a reference.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds quite a few new things, and changes some of the previous implementation that was based around PCM audio sources. Here is a short list of changes:\r\n\r\n- Added `dca` and `opus` methods to the voice module.\r\n  - `dca` takes a path to a DCA file, reads the header to determine the channels, and then feeds the data to an InputSource. This method assumes the DCA file has the DCA1 header, and will return an error otherwise.\r\n  - `opus` takes a file in the same format as a DCA file, but without the header. The format of a file would be a series of `[frame size (i16)] [frame data]` blocks.\r\n- PcmSource is now InputSource\r\n  - InputSource adds a member `kind` that determines whether it is Opus or PCM data via the new AudioType enum.\r\n- AudioSource no longer has a `read_frame` method. It is now split into `read_pcm_frame` and `read_opus_frame`. You must determine which one to use by matching on the kind of source it is.\r\n- Added DcaError for errors when calling the dca method.\r\n- Added DcaMetadata and OpusInfo in dca.rs for deserializing the metadata. Both are stripped down to the minimum fields required, since the only field used is the amount of channels. For a full list of fields, check out the [DCA1 specification](https://github.com/bwmarrin/dca/wiki/DCA1-specification)\r\n\r\nI have tested on a few dca files that I converted using [dca-rs](https://github.com/nstafie/dca-rs) and the audio seems fine, but feel free to test yourself to make sure I didn't mess anything up.
