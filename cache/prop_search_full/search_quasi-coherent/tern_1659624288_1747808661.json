On further reflection, the former's `start_version` doesn't really have a valid use case, so `run_soft_apply` does not have that option. \r\n* Adds an extra validation method: the migrations collected from local source must be a superset of remote history table migrations (by the key `Vn__migration_description`).\r\n* `Display` for the migration report type `Report`.\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n* Turns all `log::info!` into `log::trace!` or removes it altogether.\r\n* CLI returns the `Runner::Report` rather than logging it and returning `Ok(())`.  It impls `Display` now, so the user can elect to log it or not.  \r\n\r\n### Macros\r\n* Disallow unrecognized derive macro attribute paths.\r\n* Allow the required `migrations` module to be `mod.rs` in the same directory as the migrations.\r\n* Don't error on hidden files in migration directory.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n* `Query` changes: resilient to block quotes, has an `&mut self` to append an
