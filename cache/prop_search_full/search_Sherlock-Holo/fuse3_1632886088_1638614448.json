allows each directory entry to include a off field in\r\nstruct fuse_dirent.

The FUSE file system is allowed to choose the\r\nformat of those off values. In particular, sequentially increasing\r\nindexes are usually not adequate, because if a directory entry is\r\ndeleted in between two FUSE_READDIR operations, using sequential off\r\nvalues could lead to skipping over a directory entry.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting to manage those offsets with fuse3, forcing them\r\nto be sequential, pass responsibility to the file system.\r\n\r\nFixes #12", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Sherlock-Holo/fuse3/issues/17/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Sherlock-Holo/fuse3/issues/17/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
