(if applicable)\r\nI ran `cargo test -p shuttle-common` before upgrade, and after. Both suites passed, which they shouldn't given the incompability. On trying to run the unit tests themselves, it failed, silently. Running the tests from vscode produces the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExecuting task: cargo test --package shuttle-common --lib -- backends::auth::tests --nocapture \r\n\r\n    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.22s\r\n     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/shuttle_common-28e6d65a277dfe89)\r\n\r\nrunning 0 tests\r\n\r\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 9 filtered out; finished in 0.00s\r\n```\r\nI've yet to successfully even /run/ these tests, and I'm at my wit's end. However, `cargo clippy` will try and compile and blow up because of incompatibilities and so I used that as a guide. It compiles, but it has not been tested.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1403/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1403/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1402", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1402/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1402/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/1402/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/pull/1402", "id": 2000415020, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG36WUs5f0Z6Q", "number": 1402, "title": "auth: use a centrally stored jwt signing private key", "user": {"login": "iulianbarbu", "id": 14218860, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE4ODYw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14218860?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu", "html_url": "https://github.com/iulianbarbu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iulianbarbu/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-18T13:10:44Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T11:05:13Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-23T10:39:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/pulls/1402", "html_url": "https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/pull/1402", "diff_url": "https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/pull/1402.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/pull/1402.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-23T10:39:06Z"}, "body": "## Description of change\r\n\r\nWe want our auth service to not generate a new private key for JWT signing at each release. This change should help in not invalidating the cached JWTs on the gateway when auth is released in isolation.\r\n\r\n* start auth service based on an environment secret passed through a flag, for JWT signing.\r\n* local development will use a default secret set in the `docker-compose.dev.yml`, to not require setting it up in the environment before starting the stack locally (the secret is compromised since it is stored in version control and we shouldn't use it for anything outside local development).\r\n* the JWT signing private key parsing logic will fail early in case the provided key is not valid (e.g when empty if forgetting to set it)\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?

I left adding it to instrumentation out of this PR, that will be done in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nI used an extension trait for the methods to extract the limits from the `Claim`. This allows us to have the methods for extracting limits from the claim only available where they are needed. An alternative would be to implement the methods on Claim directly, or make the fields of `Claim` public, but that would make us more exposed to [breaking changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md#structs).
