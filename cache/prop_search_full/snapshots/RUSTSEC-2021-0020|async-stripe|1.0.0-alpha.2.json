[1.80](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/07/25/Rust-1.80.0.html).\r\nThese are the following:\r\n- [Lazy doc continuation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#/doc_lazy_continuation): \r\n  > In CommonMark Markdown, the language used to write doc comments, a paragraph nested within a list or block quote does not need any line after the first one to be indented or marked. The specification calls this a \u201clazy paragraph continuation.\u201d\r\n\r\n  To avoid confusion, this means that multilines now need to be explicit. The two cases where that is the case today is for the docs on the [`async-stripe/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/blob/54553bf596a06d08c52973410c01bb9999b1401a/async-stripe/src/lib.rs#L53-L54) where we use `>`, and when generating doc comments.\r\n  The doc comments specifically, we break the line if is too long. But we don't verify that we are breaking a list item. These should be indented differently. Check bebd57e94b3db9f281a0e75e73b83ad6515818d2 and 20f3cebed317ac0f1237b980220c8ecc435f23c0.\r\n\r\n  For example, on [`generated/async-stripe-shared/src/invoice.rs`](https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/blob/54553bf596a06d08c52973410c01bb9999b1401a/generated/async-stripe-shared/src/invoice.rs#L70-L79) it there is this example that should be different on 1.80:\r\n  ```diff\r\n  /// Indicates the reason why the invoice was created.\r\n  ///\r\n  /// * `manual`: Unrelated to a subscription, for example, created via the invoice editor.\r\n  /// * `subscription`: No longer in use.\r\n  - /// Applies to subscriptions from before May 2018 where no distinction was made between updates, cycles, and thresholds.\r\n  + ///   Applies to subscriptions from before May 2018 where no distinction was made between updates, cycles, and thresholds.\r\n  /// * `subscription_create`: A new subscription was created.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [Checked cfg names:](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/07/25/Rust-1.80.0.html#checked-cfg-names-and-values) Now Rust verify that the used `cfg` are defined in the Cargo.toml. Which is not the case for multiple ones on `async-stripe-webhook`. Check c94b754ea32b8f87632a1de0c23488dd5d430979\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Note: ~This still needs #581 so that it can be compiled.~ Merged! \u2705 \r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Note 2: ~I did not run the openapi generation (seems like there are quite a few changes since the latest version available) that will fix the formatting of the docs comments. Not sure if the run of it should be part of this PR or if is fine to run afterwards.~ Nvm \ud83d\ude05 Just noticed that could run for the `current` version. So only `invoice.rs` has changed. Check https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/582/commits/74cfc031a50ee878ac69bd43a8eef5befe157376.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] ran `cargo make fmt`\r\n- [x] using [conventional

https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/452#issuecomment-1883609608 and just wanted to push this up for early conversation and to make sure no work was being duplicated. \r\n\r\nCloses #298, closes #380, closes #463, closes #520, most of #535, allows #274 more easily\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nThe main traits are defined [here](https://github.com/mzeitlin11/async-stripe/blob/b0676cbe37b10e77dbe653dfe9344a0de6668106/stripe_client_core/src/stripe_request.rs) and primarily match https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/452#issuecomment-1883609608, with one exception being defining our own library-agnostic simple `RequestBuilder` instead of using `http-types`. This allows removing that dependency for the `hyper`-based client and removing the need for annoying conversions.\r\n\r\nOne other cool benefit here is the ability to use `.customize` on any `RequestBuilder`, to receive a `CustomizableRequestBuilder` capable of setting per-request configuration (for example, to solve (#520, #380)). \r\n\r\nBeyond this file, most of the work is modifying the code generation to produce this `RequestBuilder`.  Part of making the request structs implement `StripeRequest` required converting to more of a builder pattern (see the example changes below).\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\n### Previous\r\n```\r\nlet mut payer = PayInvoice::new();\r\npayer.forgive = Some(true);\r\npayer.off_session = Some(true);\r\nlet result = payer.send(&client, &id).await.unwrap();\r\n```\r\n### New\r\n```\r\nlet result = PayInvoice::new(&id)\r\n        .forgive(true)\r\n        .off_session(true)\r\n        .send(&client)\r\n        .await\r\n        .unwrap();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Customization Example\r\n```\r\nlet session = RetrieveCheckoutSession::new(&id)\r\n      .customize()\r\n      .request_strategy(...)\r\n      .account_id(...)\r\n      .send(&client)\r\n      .await\r\n      .unwrap();\r\n```",

Very much a first pass, still some questions to answer. Initial results look promising and hopeful that profiling will reveal some other low-hanging fruit to further improve compile time.\r\n\r\nFor some quite unscientific timings, a clean release build of `examples/endpoints` goes from ~4m to 50s with `min-ser` enabled. More importantly though, the actual time to build just the binary goes from 75s to 7s, so incremental builds for code depending on `async-stripe` should be _much_ faster.\r\n\r\nStripped binary size of the `examples/endpoints` binary also went from ~70MB to ~20MB. There's likely room for further binary size improvement since a fat LTO build shrunk this further to ~13 MB.\r\n\r\n# Feature Flags\r\nThe most important question to answer is how to expose the option of using `miniserde`. This PR takes the cautious approach of adding a `min-ser` feature which skips implementing `serde::Deserialize` and instead always implements `miniserde::Deserialize` where necessary for requests. The advantage with this approach is that `min-ser` could left as an \"experimental\" feature flag, making an initial release less breaking by requiring explicitly opting into `min-ser`. There are some annoyances with this approach, though\r\n- Cargo features are additive, but `min-ser` is not additive - it removes functionality, so using it can be unintuitive (and might lead to similar feature incompatibility pains as the current `runtime*` features.\r\n- Additional code complexity - see for example the added `StripeDeserialize` trait, added to abstract over the fact that a request might need either `serde` or `miniserde` to deserialize. Also, some types become feature flag dependent, e.g. a field might be `miniserde::Value` or `serde_json::Value`, which can't be shown easily in docs. (And we have to add a bunch of `cfg` blocks)\r\n\r\nThe other alternative would be to always use `miniserde` for library functionality (deserializing requests, webhooks, etc.). Then an additional additive `serde-deserialize` flag could be added to ask for `serde::Deserialize` to be derived on all types (useful for testing purposes). This would solve the complexity issues above at the cost of making `miniserde` impossible to opt out of.\r\n\r\n# Implementation Details\r\nAs seen by the diff, this adds a bunch of generated code :) . This new code is essentially using our codegen mechanism to mimic what the `miniserde` derive is already doing to allow deserialization cases that `miniserde` cannot support:\r\n\r\n`Expandable<T>`:\r\n- We manually derive `Deserialize` for `T` so that we can publicly expose the underlying `Builder` type so that `Expandable<T>` can use the same underlying implementation as `T`.\r\n\r\n\"Union of objects\" types where the type is determined with the `\"object\"` field.\r\n- This is implemented similarly to how `serde(tag = \"x\")` works - the data gets deserialized into an untyped JSON representation, which can then be converted to the correct variant using the `\"object\"` key.  `miniserde` provides a convenient `miniserde::Value` for this purpose, but we then need to also generate impls for `Value -> T` for each `T` that we need to deserialize.\r\n\r\n\"Deleted or not\" types where the type is determined by whether there is a `deleted: true` field.\r\n- This is implemented pretty much identically to the `\"object\"` case above, just discriminating between variants using the `\"deleted\"` boolean instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/523/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/523/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/509", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/509/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/509/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/509/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/509", "id": 2147232945, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEuKLv85njJHp", "number": 509, "title": "Fix: Repaired the Axum example", "user": {"login": "arlyon", "id": 8715352, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTUzNTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8715352?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon", "html_url": "https://github.com/arlyon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-21T16:50:39Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-26T16:36:22Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-21T17:07:34Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/pulls/509", "html_url": "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/509", "diff_url": "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/509.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe/pull/509.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-21T17:07:34Z"}, "body": "Re-push of #508 with a rebase.

One piece I'm not sure how to handle is updating the release workflow to work for the new workspace structure / what the plan is for something like an early RC branch.
