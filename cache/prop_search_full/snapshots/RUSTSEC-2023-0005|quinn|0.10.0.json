than the connection? It's hard to imagine a case where a user might want to vary this per-connection, and usually the main concern is whether the common socket has DONTFRAG set. On the other hand, the reduction in complexity from moving it to the endpoint seems slight. I guess you could use a single endpoint to communicate both on a jumbo-frame-capable LAN and also the internet...\r\n- Setting IP_DONTFRAG might fail pre-Big Sur (version 11). As written, this PR will make endpoint creation fail if this occurs, probably with `EINVAL`. Are older macOS builds worth supporting?\r\n- ~Can we reduce the amount of work required from users to create a endpoint or connection with the recommended configuration for their platform?~", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/1547/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/1547/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/1545", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/1545/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/1545/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/1545/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1545", "id": 1679582424, "node_id": "PR_kwDOB58n4M5O6tul", "number": 1545, "title": "feat: use BytesMut for Transmit content", "user": {"login": "dignifiedquire", "id": 790842, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDg0Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790842?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire", "html_url": "https://github.com/dignifiedquire", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 22, "created_at": "2023-04-22T15:16:17Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-09T15:15:40Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-09T15:15:40Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quinn-rs/quinn/pulls/1545", "html_url": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1545", "diff_url": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1545.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1545.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-09T15:15:40Z"}, "body": "This is a potential solution for my current problem.
