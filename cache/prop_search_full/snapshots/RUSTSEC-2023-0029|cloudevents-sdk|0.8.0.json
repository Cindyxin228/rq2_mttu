`rdkafka` and `http` dependencies, as well as fix a `base64` deprecation warning.\r\nI'm not sure about the versioning policy. The `rdkafka` minor bump doesn't cause any breaking changes for this repo, but maybe it would for downstream users?. I'm happy to keep this at `0.8.0` (since it hasn't been released yet), or maybe `0.8.1`. Let me know what you prefer, @jcrossley3 or @Lazzaretti.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit (2025/01/01): The tokio team released [axum version 0.8.0](https://tokio.rs/blog/2025-01-01-announcing-axum-0-8-0), so I included that in this PR. \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cloudevents/sdk-rust/issues/249/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":
