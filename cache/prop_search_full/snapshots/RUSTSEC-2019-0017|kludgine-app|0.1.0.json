The UI code had these main flaws that I consider untenable:\r\n\r\n* Hard to unit test.\r\n* Hard to debug.\r\n\r\nOverall, I liked how the design was going, but Kludgine was a beast. And, I was having issues that would crop up in complex layouts that wouldn't be reproduced in simpler projects. \r\n\r\nThis PR is going to kick off a rewite of the UI system, but the first task is to strip Kludgine down to its bare parts. This is going to be the core part of Kludgine: easy to use rendering primitives and basic window/input support.\r\n\r\nThe next step will be to create a separate UI crate that will build on top o this basic framework that Kludgine provides. Kludgine may become an omnibus crate and include everything all in one with a lot of feature flags. Or, it might be that you build your app by picking and choosing which crates to use.

update rgx to wgpu 0.6, I ran into a lot of issues with lifetime management due to wgpu's new BufferSlice and its extra lifetime introduction. It significantly broke the renderer phase of Kludgine, but my wrestling with getting rgx compiling led me to stop aiming for compatibility.\r\n\r\nKludgine already wasn't using the sprite or shape pipelines, and it was using euclid for math instead of the built-in rgx types. I had a fair amount of code that was purely for converting between types. Thus, [easygpu](https://github.com/khonsulabs/easygpu) was created.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think what I learned would allow me to backpatch rgx with the updates, but I'm honestly pretty happy with the smaller footprint of this dependency and its goals, so probably will just maintain easygpu moving forward.

update rgx to wgpu 0.6, I ran into a lot of issues with lifetime management due to wgpu's new BufferSlice and its extra lifetime introduction. It significantly broke the renderer phase of Kludgine, but my wrestling with getting rgx compiling led me to stop aiming for compatibility.\r\n\r\nKludgine already wasn't using the sprite or shape pipelines, and it was using euclid for math instead of the built-in rgx types. I had a fair amount of code that was purely for converting between types. Thus, [easygpu](https://github.com/khonsulabs/easygpu) was created.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think what I learned would allow me to backpatch rgx with the updates, but I'm honestly pretty happy with the smaller footprint of this dependency and its goals, so probably will just maintain easygpu moving forward. I toyed with inlining it and easygpu-lyon, but I opted to keep those crates more focused.
