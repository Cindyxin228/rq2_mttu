To do a full static link, instead I need to use pk11wrap_static/softokn_static/freebl_static. I made this an option for the app-svc build, but we could also change the default for NSS debug builds. My guess is that the static linking for NSS in debug for this ohttp crate was just to avoid mucking with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, in which case doing the full static link is probably a better path to the same result.\r\n\r\nDown the road, I'd like to consider unifying the many build.rs scripts in gecko/app-svc to consolidate build system goo for gecko, etc. My thinking is to move into the application-services:nss_build_common which will become part of mozilla-unified. Then the logic around gecko builds, as well as around static nss builds could be maintained once.
