Let's start simple\r\n  and try to get some basic schema generated already.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Refactor build steps to generate blueprints instead**\r\n    The blueprint is generated at the root of the repository and is\r\n  intended to be versioned with the rest. It acts as a business card\r\n  that contains many practical information. There's a variety of tools\r\n  we can then build on top of open-source contracts. And, quite\r\n  importantly, the blueprint is language-agnostic; it isn't specific to\r\n  Aiken. So it is really meant as an interop format within the\r\n  ecosystem.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Refactor test collection to use the new CheckedModules method**\r\n    And also, caught a little issue regarding the filtering of test cases.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Move UPLC dump into separate function + log event.**\r\n    ```\r\n    Compiling aiken-lang/stdlib 43d8e740ffdf5febc59e51b7f0d5f8506115340c (examples/hello_world/build/packages/aiken-lang-stdlib)\r\n    Compiling aiken-lang/hello_world 1.0.0 (examples/hello_world)\r\n   Generating project's blueprint (examples/hello_world/plutus.json)\r\n    Exporting UPLC (examples/hello_world/artifacts)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add title to blueprint's validators**\r\n    And use it to prefix UPLC artifacts' names.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add title and description to exported types in the blueprint**\r\n    This also fixes a bug where the documentation of record constructor arguments would be dropped after type-checking. Took me a while to pinpoint.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Refactor blueprint & handle annotated schemas**\r\n    This also now introduce two levels of representable types (because it's needed at least for tuples):\r\n\r\n  Plutus Data (a.k.a Data) and UPLC primitives / constants (a.k.a Schema).\r\n\r\n  In practice, we don't want to specify blueprints that use direct UPLC primitives because there's little support for producing those in the ecosystem. So we should aim for producing only Data whenever we can. Yet we don't want to forbid it either in case people know what they're doing. Which means that we need to capture that difference well in the type modelling (in Rust and in the CIP-0057 specification).\r\n\r\n  I've also simplified the error type for now, just to provide some degree of feedback while working on this. I'll refine it later with proper errors.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Allow testing blueprint generation from Aiken programs**\r\n    This is quite something, because now we have a testing pipeline that\r\n  can also be used for testing other compiler-related stuff such as the\r\n  type-checker or the code generator.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Support tuples in blueprint generation.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add support for generics in the blueprint generation.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Fix nested generics and phantom-types, and handle list special case**\r\n    List of pairs are actually encoded as 'map'.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Handle opaque single-variant-single-field special case.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Fix help on unknown::module error.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Improve error reporting for the blueprint generation.**\r\n    Actually link schema error to source code with a span and a label. This is easily done and provides some extra context.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Use IndexMap throughout**\r\n     In an ideal world, I should have handlded that directly at the conflicting commit in the rebase, but this would have bubbled up through all commits... which I wasn't really quite keen on going through. So here's an extra ugly commit that comes and 'fix the rebase'.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Replace 'assets' with generated blueprints.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Better use of From/Tryfrom within the blueprint module.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Define serde's Serialize/Deserialize for Program<DeBrujin>**\r\n    This will be useful to re-use this behavior in other structure that contains a Program<DeBruijn> without having to manually serialize or deserialize the entire structure.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Implement serde's Deserialize for blueprints.**\r\n    Here's a trick though: I got lazy (a bit) and did not write a full deserializer for Schema because this is busywork and not at all necessary at this stage. Instead, I've made the blueprint parameterized by a generic type <T>; which represents the type of the underlying blueprint's schema. When deserializing from JSON, we can default to 'Value' to get a free deserializer. Since all we're interested about is the program and the metadata (purpose and title) of a validator, it works nicely.\r\n\r\n  Serialization however expects a Blueprint<Schema>, and most of the functions operates over a Blueprint<Schema> anyway.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Implement new command: address**\r\n    This calculates a validator's address from validators found in a blueprint. It also provides a convenient way to attach a delegation part to the validator if needs be. The command is meant to provide a nice user experience and works 'out of the box' for projects that have only a single validator. Just call 'aiken address' to get the validator's address.\r\n\r\n  Note that the command-line doesn't provide any option to configure the target network. This automatically assumes testnet, and will until we deem the project ready for mainnet. Those brave enough to run an Aiken's program on mainnet will find a way anyway.\r\n\r\n---\r\n---\r\n\r\nErrors preview:\r\n<img width=\"712\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 12 41 32\"
