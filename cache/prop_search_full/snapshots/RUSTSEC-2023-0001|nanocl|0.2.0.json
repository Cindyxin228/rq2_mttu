It has been a long journey since the first release and the utoipa has seen countless improvements, even coming from the latest release a numerous things have been tinkered.</p>\n<p>The API has seen quite a reform and it is unified across the board in many places. Missing attributes, configuration options and functionalities have been added to many places. Docs were improved a lot, a few bug fixes here and there and 2 new derive implementations were added.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to you dear contributor for your support and help in this project as well as those who have filed issues and created discussions on important matters that help to make this library better. :1st_place_medal:</p>\n<p>This is a breaking release and there are few things to read through when you update to this release.
