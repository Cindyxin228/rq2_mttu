documentation, improving deployment workflows, and expanding the CLI functionality for HelixDB. The most notable changes include the addition of a comprehensive contributors guide, updates to the deployment service for better binary management, and new CLI commands for configuration and offline builds.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Improvements:\r\n* Added a detailed `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file, which includes an overview of HelixDB, its project structure, key concepts, architecture flow, development guidelines, and a getting-started guide. This provides a clear roadmap for contributors and developers.\r\n\r\n### Deployment Workflow Enhancements:\r\n* Updated the `hbuild_redploy` deployment service to include support for pulling binaries from S3, setting permissions, restarting services, and reverting to the old binary in case of failures. This ensures a more robust and automated deployment process.

includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- A complete rewrite of the transpiler\r\n- Uses set types to generate directly from meaning less hacky work\r\naround for specific cases\r\n- Uses Wrapper types for references, separators etc to ensure\r\nconsistency\r\n- Writes rust code per enum/struct instead of adding strings to global\r\nstring that is printed at the end\r\n     - Implements display trait for enums/structs to write rust code \r\n- Many updates to the analyzer\r\n- Improved error messaging to show more clear messages along with the\r\nfull file path for cmd+click access\r\n     - More complete type checking for nested anonymous traversals\r\n- Type checking for variables top level for loops (variables in nested\r\nfor loop definitions are not handled yet if they are variables from the\r\nparent for loop)\r\n- Implemented a shortest path function that uses BFS to find the\r\nshortest path between two nodes.\r\n- HQL now allows trailing commas\r\n- You can now define default values in the schema like so:\r\n    ```js\r\n     N::User {\r\n         post_count: U64 DEFAULT 0\r\n     }\r\n     ```\r\n- I have also implemented secondary global indexing which can be used\r\nlike so:\r\n    ```js\r\n     // in schema.hx\r\n     N::User {\r\n         INDEX username: String\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     // in queries.hx\r\n     QUERY getUserByName(name: String) => \r\n         users <- N<User>({username: name})\r\n         RETURN users\r\n     ```\r\n- Made properties optional as part of serialization/deserialization into bincode meaning 8 bytes are saved per empty property map. \r\n- ~20% performance improvement\r\n- more than 23% space saving\r\n## Type of Change\r\n<!-- Mark the appropriate option with an \"x\" -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change

vector config. rename to db_max_size_gb.\r\n- [X] add a `helix save` command to just take the `.mdb` file with you\r\n- [ ] also going to remove `--local` from `helix deploy` flag since we are no longer providing a managed service (BREAKING CHANGE FOR DEMOS)\r\n- [X] introduce a `helix delete <instance_id>` to delete an instance fully AND it's data\r\n- [X] introduce a `helix label

generation of ids for vectors straight into `HVector::new` and `HVector::slice` since passing in a custom id doesn't make sense anymore because of the time based uuid now implemented\r\n- [X] Moved and fixed up tests for `vector.rs` to `vector_tests.rs`\r\n- [X] Optimized `vector_core::search_level` with better iterators\r\n- [X] `helix update`\r\n- [X] `helix version`\r\n- [X] cli ./build.sh goes to `.local/bin/` like the curl install\r\n- [X] update helix-cli version\r\n- [X] update helix-db version\r\n\r\nready for v1.0.85 \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n### Issues resolved with this pr\r\ncloses

the following changes:\r\n\r\n- A complete rewrite of the transpiler\r\n     - Uses set types to generate directly from meaning less hacky work around for specific cases\r\n     - Uses Wrapper types for references, separators etc to ensure consistency \r\n     - Writes rust code per enum/struct instead of adding strings to global string that is printed at the end\r\n     - Implements display trait for enums/structs to write rust code \r\n- Many updates to the analyzer\r\n     - Improved error messaging to show more clear messages along with the full file path for cmd+click access\r\n     - More complete type checking for nested anonymous traversals\r\n     - Type checking for variables top level for loops (variables in nested for loop definitions are not handled yet if they are variables from the parent for loop)\r\n- Implemented a shortest path function that uses BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes. \r\n- HQL now allows trailing commas\r\n- You can now define default values in the schema like so:\r\n    ```js\r\n     N::User {\r\n         post_count: U64 DEFAULT 0\r\n     }\r\n     ```\r\n- I have also implemented secondary global indexing which can be used like so:\r\n    ```js\r\n     // in schema.hx\r\n     N::User {\r\n         INDEX username: String\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     // in queries.hx\r\n     QUERY getUserByName(name: String) => \r\n         users <- N<User>({username: name})\r\n         RETURN users\r\n     ```\r\n## Type of Change\r\n<!-- Mark the appropriate option with an \"x\" -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes

Provide a brief description of the changes in this PR -->\r\nIn this PR I have implemented the initial static analyzer for HelixQL. It runs over the parsed AST and returns a Vec of diagnostics that can be displayed. Diagnostics are either Error or warnings. Diagnostics take the following form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: field `name` was previously excluded in this traversal (in QUERY named `excludedField`)\r\n   \u250c\u2500 query.hx:6:36\r\n   \u2502 \r\n 6 \u2502                 n <- u::!{name}::{name}\r\n   \u2502                                   ^^^^\r\n---> help: remove the exclusion of `name`\r\n   \u2502\r\n 6 - u::!{name}::{name}\r\n 6 + u::{name}\r\n   \u2502    \r\n```\r\nWhere it shows you the severity, the reason, the location (and the piece of code where the error is), a hint of how to fix and if possible the actual change that is necessary. \r\n\r\nThe interpreter currently correctly checks the following parts of the query language:\r\n- The existence of node types used in To/From edge properties\r\n- The existence of variable names before they are used (needs more thorough checking)\r\n- Type checking property accesses/exclusions (ensures they exist, haven't already been excluded)\r\n- Type checking boolean operations (checks that property access is of correct type to compare against comparison value)\r\n\r\nI have also implemented some performance improvements for fetching incoming and outgoing edges by getting all duplicates in one memory access instead of one memory access for each edge. It still lazily decodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n<!-- Mark the appropriate option with an \"x\" -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature

documentation, improving deployment workflows, and expanding the CLI functionality for HelixDB. The most notable changes include the addition of a comprehensive contributors guide, updates to the deployment service for better binary management, and new CLI commands for configuration and offline builds.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Improvements:\r\n* Added a detailed `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file, which includes an overview of HelixDB, its project structure, key concepts, architecture flow, development guidelines, and a getting-started guide. This provides a clear roadmap for contributors and developers.\r\n\r\n### Deployment Workflow Enhancements:\r\n* Updated the `hbuild_redploy` deployment service to include support for pulling binaries from S3, setting permissions, restarting services, and reverting to the old binary in case of failures. This ensures a more robust and automated deployment process.

The most notable changes include the addition of a comprehensive contributors guide, updates to the deployment service for better binary management, and new CLI commands for configuration and offline builds.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Improvements:\r\n* Added a detailed `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file, which includes an overview of HelixDB, its project structure, key concepts, architecture flow, development guidelines, and a getting-started guide. This provides a clear roadmap for contributors and developers.\r\n\r\n### Deployment Workflow Enhancements:\r\n* Updated the `hbuild_redploy` deployment service to include support for pulling binaries from S3, setting permissions, restarting services, and reverting to the old binary in case of failures. This ensures a more robust and automated deployment process.
