can now be globally and individually configured to fail the build on error or report-only\r\n  - convert the `cargo udep ...` check into a style\r\n- fix clippy and spelling style lints\r\n  - fix dashboard display of `cargo clippy` lint complaints\r\n  - fix broken `cspell`\r\n- fix FreeBSD test\r\n\r\n  FreeBSD testing only functioned if the repository name was 'coreutils'. If the repository had another name, the step broke. It's now been revised into a more robust form which will function within any repository.\r\n\r\n- fix MacOS code coverage\r\n\r\n  Recent commits to 'coreutils' use the 'selinux' crate which forces the use of the 'nix' v0.23+ crate which, unfortunately, has a number of recent changes which break the MacOS coverage build and the 'uu_yes' sub-crate.\r\n\r\n  - The MacOS error needs a reversion to an earlier 'nix' version, but the earlier working version can't be used because of the force by 'selinux'. So, a patched version was vendored, all uses of 'nix' were normalized/pinned to the 'nix' patch version, the patch was entered into 'Cargo.toml' (with a FixME comment to remove when 'nix' incorporated the PR), and a PR was opened to make the required change to 'nix' (see [nix/PR](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1590)).\r\n    - ref: [PR](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1590) ; issues ... <https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/issues/1588> , <https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/issues/1555> , <https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1560>\r\n  - `uu_yes`: Some error conversion logic had to be re-written b/c of changes within 'nix' for v0.23. I believe that the code in question converts nix::Errors to std::Error, with a fallback to last_os_error() error number. With 'nix' v0.23, `nix::Error` is now == `nix::Errno`. I believe I captured the correct gist of the code and all tests still pass, but @blyxxyz , would you mind looking at commit (4ef2faf3) and let me know if it needs a change?\r\n\r\nThe last commit is an exploration of adding dependencies between CI steps; eg, the build/test steps won't run until dependency and MSRV checks pass, and code coverage won't run until/unless the build steps all pass.\r\n\r\n- More efficient in not burning CPU cycles when the build is failing.\r\n- Slightly better look on the dashboard?\r\n- Hate it? Like it?\r\n- Easy to drop if everyone hates it.\r\n\r\nI'll convert from draft to final PR when the `yes` change is ok'd and we make a decision about whether to keep the new step dependencies.\r\n",
