[#2014](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2014): Added a separate thread for the block importer.\r\n- [#2013](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2013): Added a separate thread to process P2P database lookups.\r\n- [#2004](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2004): Added new CLI argument `continue-services-on-error` to control internal flow of services.\r\n- [#2004](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2004): Added handling of incorrect shutdown of the off-chain GraphQL worker by using state rewind feature.\r\n- [#2007](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2007): Improved metrics:\r\n  - Added database metrics per column.\r\n  - Added statistic about commit time of each database.\r\n  - Refactored how metrics are registered: Now, we use only one register shared between all metrics. This global register is used to encode all metrics.\r\n- [#1996](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1996): Added support for rollback command when state rewind feature is enabled. The command allows the rollback of the state of the blockchain several blocks behind until the end of the historical window. The default historical window it 7 days.\r\n- [#1996](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1996): Added support for the state rewind feature. The feature allows the execution of the blocks in the past and the same execution results to be received. Together with forkless upgrades, execution of any block from the past is possible if historical data exist for the target block height.\r\n- [#1994](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1994): Added the actual implementation for the `AtomicView::latest_view`.\r\n- [#1972](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1972): Implement `AlgorithmUpdater` for `GasPriceService`\r\n- [#1948](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1948): Add new `AlgorithmV1` and `AlgorithmUpdaterV1` for the gas price. Include tools for analysis\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): Added new CLI arguments:\r\n    - `graphql-max-depth`\r\n    - `graphql-max-complexity`\r\n    - `graphql-max-recursive-depth`\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- [#2015](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2015): Small fixes for the database:\r\n  - Fixed the name for historical columns - Metrics was working incorrectly for historical columns.\r\n  - Added recommended setting for the RocksDB - The source of recommendation is official documentation https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Setup-Options-and-Basic-Tuning#other-general-options.\r\n  - Removed repairing since it could corrupt the database if fails - Several users reported about the corrupted state of the database after having a \"Too many descriptors\" error where in logs, repairing of the database also failed with this error creating a `lost` folder.\r\n- [#2010](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2010): Updated the block importer to allow more blocks to be in the queue. It improves synchronization speed and mitigate the impact of other services on synchronization speed.\r\n- [#2006](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2006): Process block importer events first under P2P pressure.\r\n- [#2002](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2002): Adapted the block producer to react to checked transactions that were using another version of consensus parameters during validation in the TxPool. After an upgrade of the consensus parameters of the network, TxPool could store invalid `Checked` transactions. This change fixes that by tracking the version that was used to validate the transactions.\r\n- [#1999](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1999): Minimize the number of panics in the codebase.\r\n- [#1990](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1990): Use latest view for mutate GraphQL queries after modification of the node.\r\n- [#1992](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1992): Parse multiple relayer contracts, `RELAYER-V2-LISTENING-CONTRACTS` env variable using a `,` delimiter.\r\n- [#1980](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1980): Add `Transaction` to relayer 's event filter\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n- [#2012](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2012): Bumped the `fuel-vm` to `0.55.0` release. More about the change [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.55.0).\r\n- [#2001](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2001): Prevent GraphQL query body to be huge and cause OOM. The default body size is `1MB`. The limit can be changed by the `graphql-request-body-bytes-limit` CLI argument.\r\n- [#1991](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1991): Prepare the database to use different types than `Database` for atomic view.\r\n- [#1989](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1989): Extract `HistoricalView` trait from the `AtomicView`.\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): New `fuel-core-client` is incompatible with the old `fuel-core` because of two requested new fields.\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): Changed default value for `api-request-timeout` to be `30s`.\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): Now, GraphQL API has complexity and depth limitations on the queries. The default complexity limit is `20000`. It is ~50 blocks per request with transaction IDs and ~2-5 full blocks.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- [#2000](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2000): Use correct query name in metrics for aliased queries.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Generate and publish code coverage reports in the CI by @Dentosal in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1947\r\n* Gas Price Algorithm by @MitchTurner in

Overview\r\n\r\nAdded support for the state rewind feature. The feature allows the execution of the blocks in the past and the same execution results to be received. Together with forkless upgrades, execution of any block from the past is possible if historical data exist for the target block height. The default size of historical/rewind window is 7 days. \r\n\r\nAlso added support for rollback command when state rewind feature is enabled. The command allows the rollback of the state of the blockchain several blocks behind until the end of the historical window.\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\nThe change adds a new `HistoricalRocksDB` type that is the wrapper around regular `RocksDB`. This type has inside another RocksDB instance that is used to duplicate all tables plus has one more column to store the reverse modifications at each block height. The reverse modification is the opposite to the operation that was done during transition from block height X to X + 1. The screenshot below should describe the idea:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"723\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/assets/18346821/c4becce0-1669-4938-8dd7-87d274efa224\">\r\n\r\nThe key of duplicated tables is extended with block height, and the value is the reverse operation to reach the state of entry at the previous height. Having the history of reverse operations, we can iterate back from the latest version of the entry to the previous one.\r\n\r\nUsing the main property of the RocksDB(sorting keys by default), lookup operations are fast and we don't need to iterate all modifications. It is just enough to find the nearest reverse operation to the target height.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in tests\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have

`MetadataStorage`\r\n\r\n`L2BlockSource` is for getting the latest block as they are committed and using that to update the gas price algorithm.\r\n`MetadataStorage` is for maintaining the state of the updater in the case the service shuts down or needs to be restarted. For now it just naively stores the `AlgorithmUpdaterV1`, and just the most recent version. I don't know if we need to consider storing older versions of it for the scenario we need to roll back the chain.\r\n\r\nI started adding the DA Record stuff, but we're not using it so we can YAGNI it for now, otherwise it would just be implementing a bunch of adapters that don't do anything.\r\n\r\nThis implements the service without any live adapters for the ports.\r\n\r\nWill follow this up with another PR that actually implements the ports.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in

crashes.\r\n\r\nThe synchronization speed improvement is done by:\r\n- Making all requests asynchronous. Before, the first request to fetch the blocked header was synchronous and required awaiting it because of `and_then`.\r\n- The process of block fetching is separated from block execution. Before, we fetched X blocks and waited for their execution before requesting new X blocks. The fetching is a new parallel task that uses the `batch_sender` variable for backpressure. The task fetches blocks in parallel and sends them into a channel with buffer `1`. The executor's task is to receive the batch from the channel and execute it, allowing the request for a new batch to be made in parallel.\r\n\r\nIf the execution speed is faster than fetching, we request more than one batch in parallel, up to the buffer limit. Tests shows that.\r\n\r\nThe change also handles cases better when a P2P request fails without a known `PeerId`.\r\n\r\nWithout change, I was syncing 2M blocks for 4 hours. With this change, it takes me 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in tests\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the code myself\r\n",

[#1898](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1898): Enforce increasing of the `Executor::VERSION` on each release.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#1906](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1906): Makes `cli::snapshot::Command` members public such that clients can create and execute snapshot commands programmatically. This enables snapshot execution in external programs, such as the regenesis test suite. \r\n- [#1891](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1891): Regenesis now preserves `FuelBlockMerkleData` and `FuelBlockMerkleMetadata` in the off-chain table. These tables are checked when querying message proofs.\r\n- [#1886](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1886): Use ref to `Block` in validation code\r\n- [#1876](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1876): Updated benchmark to include the worst scenario for `CROO` opcode. Also include consensus parameters in bench output.\r\n- [#1879](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1879): Return the old behaviour for the `discovery_works` test.\r\n- [#1848](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1848): Added `version` field to the `Block` and `BlockHeader` GraphQL entities. Added corresponding `version` field to the `Block` and `BlockHeader` client types in `fuel-core-client`.\r\n- [#1873](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1873/): Separate dry runs from block production in executor code, remove `ExecutionKind` and `ExecutionType`, remove `thread_block_transaction` concept, remove `PartialBlockComponent` type, refactor away `inner` functions.\r\n- [#1900](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1900): Update the root README as `fuel-core run` no longer has `--chain` as an option. It has been replaced by `--snapshot`.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n- [#1894](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1894): Use testnet configuration for local testnet.\r\n- [#1894](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1894): Removed support for helm chart.\r\n- [#1910](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1910): `fuel-vm` upgraded to `0.50.0`.

Updated the application hash root calculation to not pad numbers.\r\n- [#1866](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1866): Fixed a runtime panic that occurred when restarting a node. The panic happens when the relayer database is already populated, and the relayer attempts an empty commit during start up. This invalid commit is removed in this PR.\r\n- [#1871](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1871): Fixed `block` endpoint to return fetch the blocks from both databases after regenesis.\r\n- [#1856](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1856): Replaced instances of `Union` with `Enum` for GraphQL definitions of `ConsensusParametersVersion` and related types. This is needed because `Union` does not support multiple `Version`s inside discriminants or empty variants. \r\n- [#1870](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1870): Fixed benchmarks for the `0.25.3`. \r\n- [#1870](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1870): Improves the performance of getting the size of the contract from the `InMemoryTransaction`.\r\n- [#1851](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1851/): Provided migration capabilities (enabled addition of new column families) to RocksDB instance.\r\n\r\n### Added \r\n\r\n- [#1853](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1853): Added a test case to verify the database's behavior when new columns are added to the RocksDB database.\r\n- [#1860](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1860): Regenesis now preserves `FuelBlockIdsToHeights` off-chain table.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#1847](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1847): Simplify the validation interface to use `Block`. Remove `Validation` variant of `ExecutionKind`.\r\n- [#1832](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1832): Snapshot generation can be cancelled. Progress is also reported.\r\n- [#1837](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1837): Refactor the executor and separate validation from the other use cases\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Weekly

[#1821](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1821): Can handle missing tables in snapshot.\r\n- [#1814](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1814): Bugfix: the `iter_all_by_prefix` was not working for all tables. The change adds a `Rust` level filtering.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#1831](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1831): Included the total gas and fee used by transaction into `TransactionStatus`.\r\n- [#1821](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1821): Propagate shutdown signal to (re)genesis. Also add progress bar for (re)genesis.\r\n- [#1813](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1813): Added back support for `/health` endpoint.\r\n- [#1799](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1799): Snapshot creation is now concurrent.\r\n- [#1811](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1811): Regenesis now preserves old blocks and transactions for GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#1833](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1833): Regenesis of `SpentMessages` and `ProcessedTransactions`.\r\n- [#1830](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1830): Use versioning enum for WASM executor input and output.\r\n- [#1816](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1816): Updated the upgradable executor to fetch the state transition bytecode from the database when the version doesn't match a native one. This change enables the WASM executor in the \"production\" build and requires a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\r\n- [#1812](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1812): Follow-up PR to simplify the logic around parallel snapshot creation.\r\n- [#1809](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1809): Fetch `ConsensusParameters` from the database\r\n- [#1808](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1808): Fetch consensus parameters from the provider.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n- [#1826](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1826): The changes make the state transition bytecode part of the `ChainConfig`. It guarantees the state transition's availability for the network's first blocks.\r\n    The change has many minor improvements in different areas related to the state transition bytecode:\r\n    - The state transition bytecode lies in its own file(`state_transition_bytecode.wasm`) along with the chain config file. The `ChainConfig` loads it automatically when `ChainConfig::load` is called and pushes it back when `ChainConfig::write` is called.\r\n    - The `fuel-core` release bundle also contains the `fuel-core-wasm-executor.wasm` file of the corresponding executor version.\r\n    - The regenesis process now considers the last block produced by the previous network. When we create a (re)genesis block of a new network, it has the `height = last_block_of_old_netowkr + 1`. It continues the old network and doesn't overlap blocks(before, we had `old_block.height == new_genesis_block.hegiht`).\r\n    - Along with the new block height, the regenesis process also increases the state transition bytecode and consensus parameters versions. It guarantees that a new network doesn't use values from the previous network and allows us not to migrate `StateTransitionBytecodeVersions` and `ConsensusParametersVersions` tables.\r\n    - Added a new CLI argument, `native-executor-version,` that allows overriding of the default version of the native executor. It can be useful for side rollups that have their own history of executor upgrades.\r\n    - Replaced:\r\n      \r\n      ```rust\r\n               let file = std::fs::File::open(path)?;\r\n               let mut snapshot: Self = serde_json::from_reader(&file)?;\r\n      ```\r\n      \r\n      with a:\r\n      \r\n      ```rust\r\n               let mut json = String::new();\r\n               std::fs::File::open(&path)\r\n                   .with_context(|| format!(\"Could not open snapshot file: {path:?}\"))?\r\n                   .read_to_string(&mut json)?;\r\n               let mut snapshot: Self = serde_json::from_str(json.as_str())?;\r\n      ```\r\n      because it is 100 times faster for big JSON files.\r\n    - Updated all tests to use `Config::local_node_*` instead of working with the `SnapshotReader` directly. It is the preparation of the tests for the futures bumps of the `Executor::VERSION`. When we increase the version, all tests continue to use `GenesisBlock.state_transition_bytecode = 0` while the version is different, which forces the usage of the WASM executor, while for tests, we still prefer to test native execution. The `Config::local_node_*` handles it and forces the executor to use the native version.\r\n    - Reworked the `build.rs` file of the upgradable executor. The script now caches WASM bytecode to avoid recompilation. Also, fixed the issue with outdated WASM bytecode. The script reacts on any modifications of the `fuel-core-wasm-executor` and forces recompilation (it is why we need the cache), so WASM bytecode always is actual now.\r\n- [#1822](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1822): Removed support of `Create` transaction from debugger since it doesn't have any script to execute.\r\n- [#1822](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1822): Use `fuel-vm 0.49.0` with new transactions types - `Upgrade` and `Upload`. Also added `max_bytecode_subsections` field to the `ConsensusParameters` to limit the number of bytecode subsections in the state transition bytecode. \r\n- [#1816](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1816): Updated the upgradable executor to fetch the state transition bytecode from the database when the version doesn't match a native one. This change enables the WASM executor in the \"production\" build and requires a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the code
