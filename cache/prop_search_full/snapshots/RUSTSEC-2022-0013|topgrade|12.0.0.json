<code>make_bitflags!</code> macro. Previously, code like this was accepted:</p>\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>#[bitflags]\n#[repr(u8)]\n#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]\nenum Test {\n    A = 1,\n    B = 2,\n}\n<p>impl Test {\nconst C: u8 = 69;\n}</p>\n<p>fn main() {\nlet x = make_bitflags!(Test::{C});\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>Iterating over <code>x</code> would then create values of <code>Test</code> with bit patterns that don't correspond to any of the variants, which is undefined behavior.</p>\n<p>This bug has been introduced in 0.7.0, together with the <code>make_bitflags!</code> macro itself.</p>\n<p>I don't think it is likely that this was actually present in anyone's code, but in an abundance of caution, I have yanked all affected versions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/1686\">RUSTSEC advisory pending</a>.</p>\n<h2>Release 0.7.6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to <code>syn</code> 2.0 (thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mwkmwkmwk\"><code>@\u200bmwkmwkmwk</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Bump MSRV to 1.56.0 to support the above</li>\n<li>Update crate metadata to compensate for gender drift :3</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/687709f621a173e3d3a05905e676923d4fa99162\"><code>687709f</code></a> Release 0.7.7</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/24b13aa97ae8f275b411350816460680022151f5\"><code>24b13aa</code></a> Make make_bitflags! sound even when dirty tricks are employed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/467fe56b2cafa4364fe4d3e40fbc6ee27d9d897c\"><code>467fe56</code></a> Deploy tactical nuclear warhead on comment</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/682237c6adcf65694db3e5bb209d5a9bb93866a2\"><code>682237c</code></a> Release 0.7.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/e58ea0566f360127d610f59db6a8fc95593c751e\"><code>e58ea05</code></a> Clean-up following MSRV bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/67704d73ec490e14b84591427e4ce29ec1f8fa77\"><code>67704d7</code></a> Compensate for gender drift :3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/dcf373d7cad7c590cf7b7142a9105e7d28b8d708\"><code>dcf373d</code></a> Bump MSRV in CI</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/f50c4161c057bf1d828904087ac1e64be2b2ad6b\"><code>f50c416</code></a> Fix new clippy warnings</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/d8532effe77fed671416f5f06eb47fe51946e48d\"><code>d8532ef</code></a> Fix trybuild drift</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/commit/d43378e00caec98356f513473a556d9746dde413\"><code>d43378e</code></a> Update syn to v2</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/meithecatte/enumflags2/compare/v0.7.5...v0.7.7\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=enumflags2&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.7.5&new-version=0.7.7)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
