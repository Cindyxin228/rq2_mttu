Closes #178 \r\n\r\n- [x] refactor common client code into single struct\r\n- [x] add idempotency strategy\r\n- [x] add retries strategy \r\n- [x] port async-std client\r\n- [x] port tokio and tokio-blocking clients \r\n- [x] restore set_stripe_account api\r\n- [x] determine time-out function\r\n- [x] fill out documentation\r\n- [ ] add examples\r\n- [x] clone requests correctly\r\n\r\nThere are 4 strategies:\r\n\r\n## Once\r\n\r\nThis is the basic usage (and the default). This strategy will attempt to make a request, and immediately return control to the caller when it fails.\r\n\r\n## Idempotent\r\n\r\nThis is one step up from `Once`. Using this strategy will use a idempotency key of your choice, and make requests with it. Failures will continue to return control to the caller, however you may retry the request at will.\r\n\r\n## Retry (not recommended)\r\n\r\nThis strategy will make the same request up to `n` times, immediately one-after-the-other. This strategy is not recommended for production use as it is bad manners. Regardless, it may be useful for testing.\r\n\r\n## Exponential Back-off\r\n\r\nThis strategy inherits all the semantics of the `Retry` strategy, but with an increasing wait between requests.\r\n\r\n> \ud83d\udea8 Note: in both the `Retry` and `ExponentialBackoff` strategies `n` is the maximum limit. If the stripe API explicitly communicates to the client that a retry is not useful (via the `Stripe-Should-Retry` header), the request will be aborted without reaching the limit.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// create a client, and use the ExponentialBackoff strategy for all subsequent requests\r\nlet client = Client::new(\"sk_1234\").with_strategy(RequestStrategy::ExponentialBackoff(5));\r\n\r\n// we need manual control, let's make a new client and use the idempotent strategy\r\nlet idempotent = client.clone().with_strategy(RequestStrategy::Idempotent(\"my_token\"));\r\n```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/arlyon/async-stripe/issues/184/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":

attempt into breaking up the openapi code and making it more approachable. The main focus is on top-level visibility, simplifying the APIs used in main.\r\n\r\nUsage is as follows:\r\n- load the spec\r\n- create a `Metadata`\r\n- create a `UrlFinder`\r\n- call `Metadata::get_files` to get `FileGenerators` for each object in the API\r\n- call `FileGenerator::write` for each file\r\n- call `FileGenerator::write` for the generators produced by the first write\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to:\r\n- [x] replace prints with proper logging\r\n- [x] fix a number of clippy lints\r\n- [x] selectively enable / disable Boxing based on a (currently primitive) heuristic \r\n\r\nThis will hopefully provide a base to better define the abstractions now that the code is a little tidier.", "reactions": {"url":
