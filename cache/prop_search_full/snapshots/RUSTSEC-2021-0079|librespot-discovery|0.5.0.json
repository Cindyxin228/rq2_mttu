this oauth stuff really belongs in core, it doesn't feel quite right there so I added a new module. That new module could be useful standalone so it makes sense. If someone wants to take this and do something else that is fine by me. \r\n\r\nThis also leaves the token stuff a bit messy. We now provide two ways to get an access token:\r\n1. `session.token_provider().get_token(\"your,scopes\")` using keymaster (Mercury)\r\n2. `session.spclient().auth_token()` using login5 (HTTP) \r\n\r\nBoth methods work (for session auth and playback) when you authenticate your session using a password or stored credentials. However, method 1 doesn't work when you authenticate your session using a spotify token (obtained using either method). \r\n\r\nI think we want to get rid of this annoying pitfall. We could:\r\na) Get rid of method 1 altogether\r\nb) Method 1 use method 2 under the hood\r\nc) Change session authentication so when stored-creds are not used, it auths to obtain them and then re-auths using them.\r\n\r\nFixes #1308", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1309/reactions", "total_count": 29, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

I've tested it on windows with default options. The most notable change is in the discovery server, where the code has changed significantly to accommodate changes in `hyper`. The intent of the code remains the same, and I confirmed that it functions correctly on my devices.\r\n\r\n[`hyper-proxy`](https://github.com/tafia/hyper-proxy) is swapped out in favor of a maintained fork, [`hyper-proxy2`](https://github.com/siketyan/hyper-proxy2).

Webpki only uses Subject Alternate Names when validating certificates, and the common name handling was buggy, producing <code>Error::BadDer</code> when iterating certificates with printable string subject common names, or omitted common names encoded as an empty sequence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<p>The following PRs were backported to the rel-0.101 branch in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/170\">#170</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Further limits on expensive path building (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/163\">#163</a>)</li>\n<li>Budget tweaks (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/164\">#164</a>)</li>\n<li>Bound name constraint comparisons (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/165\">#165</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove subject common name parsing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/169\">#169</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/hawkw\"><code>@\u200bhawkw</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Correct handling of fatal errors (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/168\">#168</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to all who have contributed, on behalf of the rustls team (<a href=\"https://github.com/ctz\"><code>@\u200bctz</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cpu\"><code>@\u200bcpu</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/djc\"><code>@\u200bdjc</code></a>)!</p>\n<h2>0.101.4</h2>\n<h2>Release notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>certificate path building and verification is now capped at 100 signature validation operations to avoid the risk of CPU usage denial-of-service attack when validating crafted certificate chains producing quadratic runtime.

boot as a service discovery may fail due to it trying to bind to interfaces before the network is actually up. This could be prevented in systemd by starting the service after network-online.target but it requires that a wait-online.service is also enabled which is not always the case since a wait-online.service can potentially hang the boot process until it times out in certain situations. This allows for discovery to retry every 10 secs in the 1st 60 secs of uptime before giving up thus papering over the issue and not holding up the boot process.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1178/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1178/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1164", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1164/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1164/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1164/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/1164", "id": 1708550128, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBpoPdM5Qb56n", "number": 1164, "title": "Update dependencies sysinfo and RSA", "user": {"login": "yubiuser", "id": 26622301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjIyMzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26622301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser", "html_url": "https://github.com/yubiuser", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yubiuser/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1923688118, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIzNjg4MTE4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "6c9311", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2023-05-13T10:25:12Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-14T19:28:48Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-14T19:27:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/pulls/1164", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/1164", "diff_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/1164.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/1164.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-14T19:27:17Z"}, "body": "Updates dependencies to the latest version and regenerates `Caro.lock`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrespot-core: /librespot/core/Cargo.toml\r\n\trsa matches 0.8.2;\tlatest is 0.9.2\r\n\tsysinfo matches 0.28.4;\tlatest is 0.29.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant change was the removal of the `PublicKey` trait in `RSA`.
