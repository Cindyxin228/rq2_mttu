#1476.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nSingle-element weighted sampling is simple enough.\r\n\r\n`fn choose_two_iterator` is also simple enough: there are no weights, so we can just assign each pair of results a unique index in the list of 100 * 99 / 2 possibilities (nothing that we sort pairs since the order of chosen elements is not specified).\r\n\r\n`fn choose_two_weighted_indexed` gets a bit more complicated; I choose to approach it by building a table for the CDF of size `num*num` including impossible variants. Most of the tests don't pass, so there must be a mistake here.\r\n\r\nAside: using `let key = rng.random::<f64>().ln() / weight;` (`src/seq/index.rs:392`) may help with #1476 but does not fix the

Enable usage of Criterion command-line arguments (which are otherwise intercepted by the Rust test harness).\r\n\r\nCloses #1039.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nMostly these are straightforward translations or simplifications (Criterion can benchmark ~1ns functions well enough so we don't need 1000 repetitions inside our benchmark functions).\r\n\r\nSome I have added to benchmark groups. Some I have used shorter warmup/measurement durations since the defaults are quite conservative.\r\n\r\nMany of the new results match up very well with those from the old test framework.
