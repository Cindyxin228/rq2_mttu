For seamless onboarding of EVM users, the contract will be free of charge.\r\n\r\n### Previous work\r\nThis PR is built on top of two PRs:\r\n* https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10020: no-op PR, laying groundwork for further changes.\r\n* https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10224: empty contract as a placeholder, literally deployed to new ETH accounts.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThis PR adds `near-wallet-contract` crate (based on `runtime/near-test-contracts`) that exposes `Wallet Contract` WASM code to the runtime.\r\nIt stops deploying a copy of the `Wallet Contract` to each newly created ETH-implicit account.\r\nInstead, it uses an in-memory cached contract code on `execute_function_call` action from such account.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add `wallet-contract` crate (separated from the workspace) with placeholder `Wallet Contract` implementation.\r\n- Add `near-wallet-contract` crate (part of the workspace) that generates (through `build.rs`) and exposes the `Wallet Contract` WASM code.\r\n- Do not literally deploy `Wallet Contract` when creating ETH-implicit account. Just store reference to the `Wallet Contract`.\r\n- Treat ETH-implicit accounts specially when retrieving contract code from an account (in such case returns in-memory cached `Wallet Contract` code).\r\n- Add tests calling `Wallet Contract` where a transfer from an ETH-implicit account is possible depending on the public key passed with `rlp_transaction` argument.", "reactions": {"url":

validation.\r\nI want to combine creation of necessary `StoreUpdate` with validation, because to validate `EpochSyncInfo` we need to rebuild `BlockMerkleTree` for every block in the epoch, but also not commit it if anything goes bad, and that is supported in `ChainStoreUpdate`.\r\nCreation of `StoreUpdate` is already a big change, so I want to do a separate PR for it.\r\nTo test that we process `EpochSyncInfo` correctly I create a VERY hacky test, that should not be included in CI ever. Right now it works as intended, but if we change implementation of any sync, we will have to rewrite this test.\r\nI hope I will add epoch sync into `run_sync_step` flow soon enough for us to replace this test with something stable before we need to rewrite unstable test.

An account is created at this address.\r\n2. The account does not have any access key added. Thus, it is not possible to make a transaction from this account directly.\r\n3. The Wallet Contract (as a part of the protocol) is deployed to the account. For this PR, an empty smart contract is used as a placeholder.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- On a transfer to an ETH-implicit address, if an account does not exist yet at this address:\r\n   - Create account at this address.\r\n   - Deploy a `Wallet Contract` placeholder (empty contract now) to this account.\r\n- Update fee for a transfer to an ETH-implicit address to include account creation cost. `Wallet Contract` deployment is free of charge (user only pays for an increased storage).\r\n- Tests:\r\n   - Test whether it is possible to create an ETH-implicit account by making a transfer to that address, and whether further funds can be sent to this account.\r\n   - Test that no access key is added to an ETH-implicit account (the account is locked) and in consequence no transactions are possible from this account.\r\n- Guard the changes with `EthImplicitAccounts` protocol feature and `eth_implicit_accounts` runtime config flag.\r\n\r\n## Next work\r\n- Discuss how the `Wallet Contract` should be integrated into the protocol for efficiency.\r\n- Use the `Wallet Contract` placeholder implementation that allows to transfer funds only.", "reactions": {"url":
