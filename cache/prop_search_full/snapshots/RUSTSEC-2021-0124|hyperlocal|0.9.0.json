The server example is now based on hyper's new [server implementation guide](https://hyper.rs/guides/1/server/hello-world/).\r\n\r\nWhat was hyper 0.14 has now been split up into multiple crates. Hyper 1.0 also removes `Server` and consequentially there are no direct alternatives for a `UnixServerExt` to extend, though the upgrade guide does mention\r\n\r\n> For a server type that can handle both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 at the same time, use the [server::conn::auto::Builder](https://docs.rs/hyper-util/latest/hyper_util/server/conn/auto/struct.Builder.html) from [hyper-util](https://crates.io/crates/hyper-util).\r\n\r\nThat recommendation for `hyper_util::server::conn::auto::Builder` isn't a replacement for the old `Server` type, as it handles single socket/tcp connections at a time, rather than implementing a looping listener that automatically accepts all new connections.\r\n\r\n_Testing_\r\n\r\n* All the tests were preserved and updated.\r\n* I also tested this update to `hyperlocal` using my [Docker engine client crate](https://github.com/iamjpotts/passivized_docker_engine_client/pull/56) which connects via Unix sockets by default.\r\n\r\n_Questions_\r\n\r\n1. With the removal of `src/server.rs`, the `server` trait now only controls the additional dependencies required by `examples/server.rs` - which a client obviously wouldn't want. Should we keep the feature configuration of this crate as it is, or do you have some thoughts on changing the features? Should we rename the `server` feature to `server-example` ?\r\n\r\n3.
