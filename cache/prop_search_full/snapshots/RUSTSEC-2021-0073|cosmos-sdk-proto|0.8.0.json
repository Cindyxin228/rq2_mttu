An important consideration in this update is that the ibc module has been split off into it's own repo at https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of the ibc-go protos, @jkilpatr discovered that the service compilation (in the `compile_*_services()` functions) recompiles and overwrites the regular definitions (in the respective `compile_*_protos()` functions), resulting in missing definitions. This is a result of combining all .proto definitions into a single file, e.g. ibc-go/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v1 has genesis.proto, query.proto, transfer.proto, tx.proto. After running 2 stage compilation for the protos and then the services, the `GenesisState` struct from `ibc-go/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v1/genesis.proto` was missing in `ibc.applications.transfer.v1.rs`. Cancelling the service compilation (aka the 2nd stage) resulted in the `GenesisState` struct appearing but all grpc client methods from the other files were not being generated. Applying the service compilation method (using `tonic_build`) to **all** ibc-go proto files results in everything we want compiled.\r\n\r\nThis 1 stage compilation approach was applied to the updated cosmos-sdk protos and several missing definitions were discovered (see the latest commit for which ones precisely).\r\n\r\nNOTE: wasmd and cosmrs have not been touched and require updates \r\n\r\nNOTE: the last commit in this PR is a quick fix to resolve a namespace conflict introduced by prost's generation of an enum and a struct both named Validators in `cosmos-sdk-proto/src/prost/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.rs`'s `stake_authorization` mod. This is not a sustainable solution, but it does allow the module to compile. I renamed the enum to `IsStakeAuthorizationValidators` and the struct to `StakeAuthorizationValidators` to most closely match the generated go names
