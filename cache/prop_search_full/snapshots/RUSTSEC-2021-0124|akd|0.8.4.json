Run it with\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo bench -p akd_core -F bench\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample output\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9451356/208703918-aa0b738d-e3fd-495b-8562-6f239bf18665.png)\r\n\r\nThis benchmark is based off 1K labels needing to be computed, which we see already is a large improvement (just with a parallelism level of 4 we see a nearly 4x improvement).\r\n\r\nNOTE: Additionally this adds another caching test which should have been added in a previous PR", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/295/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/295/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/292", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/292/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/292/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/292/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/akd/pull/292", "id": 1503176922, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFr0TCM5Fy4Jx", "number": 292, "title": "Change direction from Option<usize> to u8 + Sha512/256 support", "user": {"login": "slawlor", "id": 9451356, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk0NTEzNTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9451356?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor", "html_url": "https://github.com/slawlor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3127723892, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI3NzIzODky", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "009900", "default": false, "description": "This label is managed by the Facebook bot.

To this end, this PR adds a CLI tool that generates \"fixture\" files containing entire DB states, as well as directory updates between states. Users can then load this file to set up directories with fixed states, apply a given changeset, and assert that the output directory is as expected as part of their tests.\r\n\r\n## Follow-Up Tasks\r\n\r\n- Fixture reader so that users do not need to write their own parser. \r\n- ~~Support using a database other than the in-memory one.~~ Not necessary, see discussion\r\n- Support using a custom VRF key rather than the hardcoded one.\r\n- Support using a custom hasher rather than Blake3.\r\n- Better CLI binary name - it currently adopts the crate name (akd_integration_tests).\r\n- Error handling instead of unwraps.\r\n- Add mode to allow specification of a number of users to randomly generate updates for, without needing to list out the epochs or usernames.\r\n\r\nI will create an issue tracking these tasks after this PR is approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nThe available configuration parameters can be accessed with the `--help` flag:\r\n```console\r\nakd_integration_tests \r\nThis tool allows a directory to be created with specified and random contents, capturing the\r\ndirectory state and epoch-to-epoch delta in an output file for use in debugging and as test fixtures\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n    akd_integration_tests [OPTIONS] --epochs <EPOCHS>\r\n\r\nOPTIONS:\r\n    -u, --user <USERS>\r\n            Users and their associated update events. A username is expected, followed by a colon\r\n            and a list of epochs OR (epoch, value). Usernames are expected to be utf-8 strings,\r\n            which will be internally interpreted as bytes. The following are valid examples of user\r\n            arguments: --user \"username: 1, 3, (5, 'xyz')\" --user=\"username: [(1,'abc'), 2]\" -u\r\n            \"some username: 1\"\r\n\r\n    -e, --epochs <EPOCHS>\r\n            Number of epochs to advance the tree by e.g. a value of 3 will perform 3 publishes on an\r\n            empty directory\r\n\r\n        --max_updates <MAX_UPDATES>\r\n            Maximum number of updates **per epoch** the tool should perform. Note that all user\r\n            events explicitly passed for an epoch will be included even if the number exceeds this\r\n            value [default: 10]\r\n\r\n        --min_updates <MIN_UPDATES>\r\n            Minimum number of updates **per epoch** the tool should perform. The tool will generate\r\n            random labels and values to include in an epoch if the user events explicitly passed for\r\n            an epoch are not sufficients [default: 0]\r\n\r\n    -s, --capture_states <CAPTURE_STATES>...\r\n            Epochs where the state of the directory should be captured in the output e.g. the value\r\n            3 will output all db records after epoch 3 is performed. Multiple values should be\r\n            separated with \",\"\r\n\r\n    -d, --capture_deltas <CAPTURE_DELTAS>...\r\n            Epochs where the updates required to bring the directory to the epoch should be captured\r\n            in the output. e.g. the value 3 will output all updates that were performed to advance\r\n            the directory from epoch 2 to 3. Multiple values should be separated with \",\"\r\n\r\n    -o, --out <OUT>\r\n            Name of output file. If omitted, output will be printed to stdout\r\n\r\n    -n, --no_generated_updates\r\n            Stops tool from generating random updates in publishes. Use this if you want the tool to\r\n            only use explicitly passed updates. Explicilty passed updates without values would still\r\n            use randomly generated values\r\n\r\n    -h, --help\r\n            Print help information\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nThe following is a simple run with just 2 users and 1 epoch, as the fixture file does get pretty large for larger directories. The upcoming compression of the directory state in #189 should help with this.\r\n\r\n```console\r\ncargo run -- \\\r\n    --user \"User1: (1,\u2019abc')\" \\\r\n    --user \"User2: 1\" \\\r\n    --epochs 1 \\\r\n    --max_updates 2  \\\r\n    --capture_states 1 \\\r\n    --capture_deltas 1\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```yaml\r\n# @generated This file was automatically generated by \r\n# the fixture generator tool with the following command:\r\n# \r\n# cargo run -- \\\r\n#   --user User1: (1,\u2019abc') \\\r\n#   --user User2: 1 \\\r\n#   --epochs 1 \\\r\n#   --max_updates 2 \\\r\n#   --capture_states 1 \\\r\n#   --capture_deltas 1 \\\r\n\r\n# Metadata\r\n---\r\nargs:\r\n  users:\r\n    -

This PR fixes the function to return a random 32-char string which can later be interpreted as 32 bytes.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/194/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/194/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/190", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/190/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/190/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/issues/190/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/facebook/akd/pull/190", "id": 1212432901, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFr0TCM42oODz", "number": 190, "title": "Adjusting crate dependency tree", "user": {"login": "slawlor", "id": 9451356, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk0NTEzNTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9451356?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor", "html_url": "https://github.com/slawlor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3127723892, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI3NzIzODky", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/akd/labels/CLA%20Signed", "name": "CLA Signed", "color": "009900", "default": false, "description": "This label is managed by the Facebook bot.
