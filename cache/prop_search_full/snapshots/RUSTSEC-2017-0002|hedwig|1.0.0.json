Make library more resilient to failure. A most notable instance of this is the `PublishBatch` not discarding messages that failed to publish for whatever reason. Instead those messages are retained and can be retried with a repeated call to `publish`;\r\n3. I also made the library assume less about how people might want to use this.

Renamed the variants to not duplicate `Error`, `Failed`, `Cannot`, `Unable` or similar words that are already implied by the fact that these variants are inside an enum called `Error`.\r\n4.
