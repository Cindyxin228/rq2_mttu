This makes the hotkeys work even without an X11 connection and thus works just fine in a terminal or wayland session. However this reads the keyboard that is directly attached to the PC that the process is running on rather than the keyboard associated with the X11 server, which might be a remote system. This isn't all too important for us, so that's fine. Also since we directly read all the key presses, this doesn't require \"exclusively grabbing\" any single of them. So this bring the Linux implementation closer to the rest of the platforms. Another advantage of this is that it brings support for gamepads without all too much additional effort.\r\n\r\nThanks to @P1n3appl3 for doing almost all of the work here.\r\n\r\nResolves

emscripten from the list of Linux like operating systems as it doesn't actually use the Linux kernel and instead brings its own JS implementation that errors out if you call it with `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we remove the atomic that caches whether `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` works. There's a tiny range of Linux kernels that don't have it and are still supported by Rust. While removing the atomic slows down these old kernels, the slight overhead for all the recent Linux kernels just isn't really worth it.\r\n\r\nAlso this adds a whole lot more documentation for what

std's Instant as it's insufficiently specified. It neither guarantees \"real time\" nor does it guarantee measuring \"uptime\" (the time the OS has been awake rather than suspended), meaning that you can't actually rely on it in practice. In livesplit-core we definitely want real time rather than uptime. The problem is mostly Linux. POSIX intends for `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` to be real time, but this wasn't correctly implemented in Linux and due to backwards compatibility concerns they were never able to fix it properly. Thus `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` means uptime on Linux whereas on other Unixes it means real time. They however introduced `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 which measures real time. So the solution is to use this on all operating systems that are based on the Linux kernel and fall back to `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` if the kernel is too old and the syscall fails.\r\n\r\nmacOS and iOS actually do the right thing for `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` but Rust actually doesn't use it on iOS and macOS, so we also need to use our custom implementation for those too, but skip `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` as that is Linux specific.\r\n\r\nOn Windows Instant currently measures real time, but we may need to use a custom implementation for it as well in case this ever changes.\r\n\r\nResolves #442 ", "reactions":

of elements that are basically almost entirely static on the layout. Other elements such as the timer are frequently changing. In the browser we already noticed that by pushing the timer onto its own layer, you get a fairly big performance boost out of it.\r\n\r\nHere's that Pull Request:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplitOne/pull/378\r\n\r\nWe want to apply a similar idea to the native renderer. In order to do this we first introduce flags in the layout state that mark whether a component or a part of a component is at the specific time considered frequently changing. By doing this not only does the native renderer benefit from it, but other renderers such as the web version can also make decisions based on that, as opposed to only applying the optimization to the timer component.\r\n\r\nWith all the components providing these flags, the renderer can now split up the frame into a bottom layer and a top layer where all the frequently changing elements are rendered onto the top layer and all the other elements rendered onto the bottom layer. In fact the top layer is actually the frame buffer and it simply gets cleared by copying over regions from the bottom layer. That way there is no additional compositing necessary.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the renderer is now more of a scene manager that manages entities in a scene rather than directly emitting draw calls to a backend. The scene is a data structure that allows traversing the two layers in any way a renderer (i.e. what used to be a backend) would want to render them out. So the whole design is a lot more decoupled now.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/430/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

2021-02-14</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Face::ascender</code> and <code>Face::descender</code> will use\n<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswinascent\">usWinAscent</a> and\n<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswindescent\">usWinDescent</a>\nwhen <code>USE_TYPO_METRICS</code> flag is not set in <code>OS/2</code> table.\nPreviously, those values were ignored and\n<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hhea#ascender\">hhea::ascender</a> and\n<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hhea#descender\">hhea::descender</a>\nwere used. Now <code>hhea</code> table values will be used only when <code>OS/2</code> table is not present.</li>\n<li><code>Face::outline_glyph</code> and <code>Face::glyph_bounding_box</code> in case of a <code>glyf</code> table\ncan fallback to a calculated bbox when the embedded bbox is malformed now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.11.0] - 2021-02-04</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>FaceTables</code>, which allowed to load <code>Face</code> not only from a single chunk of data,\nbut also in a per-table way. Which is useful for WOFF parsing.\nNo changes to the API.\nThanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fschutt\">fschutt</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.10.1] - 2021-01-21</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update a font used for tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.10.0] - 2021-01-16</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>variable-fonts</code> build feature. Enabled by default.\nBy disabling it you can reduce <code>ttf-parser</code> binary size overhead almost twice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(<code>gvar</code>) Increase the maximum number of variation tuples from 16 to 32.\nIncreases stack usage and makes <code>gvar</code> parsing 10% slower now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(<code>CFF</code>) Fix <code>seac</code> processing. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/wezm\">wezm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.9.0] - 2020-12-05</h2>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kern</code> AAT subtable 1 aka <code>kern::state_machine</code>.\nMainly because it's useless without a proper shaping.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.8.3] - 2020-11-15</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Face::glyph_variation_delta</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Iterator::nth</code> implementation for <code>cmap::Subtables</code> and <code>Names</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.8.2] - 2020-07-31</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

always used paths internally but those quickly got turned into meshes. It turns out that a lot of backends can actually directly work with those paths, so splitting out the path rendering makes a lot of sense. This also enables the use of `tiny-skia` for the software renderer. However here is where it gets really surprising: It turns out that `tiny-skia` is so fast, that it outperforms the GPU. And this is without any optimizations. This isn't entirely surprising as Chrome works in a very similar way where the GPU is mostly just used to compose the different Skia layers together. So for now this also removes the mesh based renderer entirely. We are going to investigate rendering into different layers, so that's where a GPU backend may come back into play, but not in the form of a mesh based renderer. \r\n\r\nAdditionally this adds support for color fonts using the `CPAL` and `COLR` tables.\r\n\r\nThis also temporarily disables the WASI tests as we are apparently hitting wasmtime limits atm.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/408/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/408/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/406", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/406/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/406/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/406/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/pull/406", "id": 800953963, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTY3MzUzMjE4", "number": 406, "title": "Update quick-xml requirement from 0.20.0 to 0.21.0", "user": {"login": "dependabot-preview[bot]", "id": 27856297, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90Mjc4NTYyOTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2141?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot-preview", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 986272241, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5ODYyNzIyNDE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "0025ff", "default": false, "description": "A dependency needs to be updated."}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-02-04T05:46:10Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-05T01:35:04Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-05T01:33:36Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/pulls/406", "html_url": "https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/pull/406", "diff_url": "https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/pull/406.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/pull/406.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-05T01:33:36Z"}, "body": "Updates the requirements on [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/blob/master/Changelog.md\">quick-xml's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.21.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>feat: Split text trim into start and end</li>\n<li>fix: <code>$value</code> rename should work the same for deserialization and serialization</li>\n<li>docs: README.md: Replace dead benchmark link</li>\n<li>style: Cargo.toml: remove &quot;readme&quot;

the support for specifying custom fonts in layouts. Unlike the original LiveSplit, this acts more as an override here. One reason for this is to make it easier for platforms to just not have any font support in the first place, such as terminal applications where it's simply not possible to change fonts. If a user never specifies a custom font, it's expected that the application can then use any font that is appropriate for the situation.\r\n\r\nFonts are specified as a font family name and additional styling information, such as the style (italic / regular), weight and stretch of the specific font to select out of the font family. The application then chooses the most appropriate font that it can find, falling back to its default fonts if it can't find the font. It turns out that different APIs and applications have very different notions of what a family name even is. This is because a font can have lots of different, even conflicting, names in its name table. The kinds of names that you specify there have evolved over the years, so there's old entries and newer entries, where the font selector has to make very unclear decisions which to prefer. It seems like modern APIs prefer to select for the `Typographic Family Name` (Name ID 16), with a fallback to `Font Family Name` (Name ID 1) in case the former is not available. Old APIs such as GDI do their own special thing though, complicating the matter even more. I have yet to fully grasp what GDI even does. Even among browsers the font selection seems to work differently. So it all seems like a big mess where you can only try to align with as many APIs as closely as possible, and a correct solution is simply not possible. Since the original LiveSplit seems to select its fonts through GDI, we also run into the issue of importing these identifiers properly. Technically we could query GDI for the specific font, but this is only possible on Windows and is not that easy, as we'd need to parse out the typographic family name, but GDI doesn't have an API for that, nor does it give you the path of the font or access to the font's data. It gives you access to the raw data of individual tables you query for, but ttf-parser doesn't expose a way to parse individual tables in its public\r\nAPI. So for all of these reason, for now we only implement a fallback converter for these identifiers where we attempt to pop individual style tokens off the end of the identifier to turn it into styling information and the family name. This is however also flawed in other ways, such as those GDI font identifiers also being limited to 32 characters, meaning that you can end up unlucky and have a style token be cut off in the middle at the end, at which point we can't recognize it as such anymore.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was vertically aligning text. Fonts have various vertical lines, such as the ascender (being the very top a glyph can reach), the baseline (the line that glyphs are written on top of), and the descender (the very bottom a glyph can reach). These three lines can be arbitrarily defined by a font. It is impossible to take two fonts and apply a linear transformation to it to align all three of these lines. Considering we usually have the text font and the times font in the same line, we however still need to make them look aligned. Also there is the possibility that more fonts get involved as certain glyphs may not be available in these fonts, such as emojis. At this point you definitely want to align their baselines. If you also keep a fixed scaling across the fonts, which is usually what you also want, you end up with ascenders and descenders that are all over the place. However this is basically a necessity, there's nothing you can do about this without harming the previously mentioned important properties. Therefore it can be concluded that any sort of attempt at vertical centering is basically impossible and you instead need to choose a baseline that looks decent across many different fonts. Coincidentally this is already what the renderer did, so nothing needed to be changed in this regard. Though we may want to take a closer look at possibly better positioning for that baseline.\r\n\r\nThe rendering unit tests aren't allowed to use any custom fonts, as that otherwise causes those tests to fail on different platforms where these fonts may not be available. Also this introduces a new `font-loading` feature where our renderer only loads any fonts if the feature is active. This is because the renderer could be compiled for a platform where the code isn't able to load any fonts for, such as in my experiments to compile the renderer to the GameCube and Gameboy Advance. So this is another reason why we simply can't load any custom fonts in our tests.\r\n\r\nResolves #104 ", "reactions": {"url":

more or less complete port of harfbuzz (state of the art) text shaping engine to Rust. This means our font handling is now about as good as the one found in a browser, except all the manual things you may need to do on top such as using different fonts for different parts of the text, because some glyphs are not available in the chosen font and handling image based glyphs such as those that are being used for emojis in some fonts. Overall though switching to rustybuzz seems to have already changed the appearance quite a bit. There is now proper kerning (though I thought rusttype already did that, but apparently not), proper ligature support and because this is state of the art, it also supports tabular numbers for example which is now activated for all the numbers that we are rendering. Unfortunately since rustybuzz does so much more work, it also heavily slowed down text shaping, which we do on every frame at the moment. So we really need to refactor the renderer to start caching a lot more stuff.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/378/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Moreover, I added an (private) enum Hotkey that makes it possible to reduce the large amount of copy&paste code.\r\nIn the livesplit-hotkey crate, the linux module was slightly modified: the old functions register and unregister were replaced by\r\ngrab_all and ungrab_all. Also the window number is now calculated in grab_all and ungrab_all, which simplifies the Hook methods slightly.\r\n\r\nI think that we should get rid of the set_split(keycode), set_skip, etc methods and instead make enum Hotkey public and use set_hotkey(hotkey,keycode) instead.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/issues/367/reactions", "total_count": 0,

requirements on [base64](https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md\">base64's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>0.13.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Config methods are const</li>\n<li>Added <code>EncoderStringWriter</code> to allow encoding directly to a String</li>\n<li><code>EncoderWriter</code> now owns its delegate writer rather than keeping a reference to it (though refs still work)\n<ul>\n<li>As a consequence, it is now possible to extract the delegate writer from an <code>EncoderWriter</code> via <code>finish()</code>, which returns <code>Result&lt;W&gt;</code> instead of <code>Result&lt;()&gt;</code>. If you were calling <code>finish()</code> explicitly, you will now need to use <code>let _ = foo.finish()</code> instead of just <code>foo.finish()</code> to avoid a warning about the unused value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When decoding input that has both an invalid length and an invalid symbol as the last byte, <code>InvalidByte</code> will be emitted instead of <code>InvalidLength</code> to make the problem more obvious.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.12.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>BinHex</code> alphabet</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.12.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>Bcrypt</code> alphabet</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.12.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>Read</code> implementation (<code>DecoderReader</code>) to let users transparently decoded data from a b64 input source</li>\n<li>IMAP's modified b64 alphabet</li>\n<li>Relaxed type restrictions to just <code>AsRef&lt;[ut8]&gt;</code> for main <code>encode*</code>/<code>decode*</code> functions</li>\n<li>A minor performance improvement in encoding</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.11.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum rust version 1.34.0</li>\n<li><code>no_std</code> is now supported via the two new features <code>alloc</code> and <code>std</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum rust version 1.27.2</li>\n<li>Fix bug in streaming encoding (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/pull/90\">#90</a>): if the underlying writer didn't write all the bytes given to it, the remaining bytes would not be retried later. See the docs on <code>EncoderWriter::write</code>.</li>\n<li>Make it configurable whether or not to return an error when decoding detects excess trailing bits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap\">line-wrap</a> crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n<ul>\n<li><code>Base64Display</code> creation no longer uses a <code>Result</code> because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\nconfigs that <code>unwrap()</code> for you are no longer needed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add a streaming encoder <code>Write</code> impl to transparently base64 as you write.</li>\n<li>Remove the remaining <code>unsafe</code> code.</li>\n<li>Remove whitespace stripping to simplify <code>no_std</code> support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: <code>filter(|b| !b&quot; \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c&quot;.contains(b)</code>.</li>\n<li>Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.3</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update safemem</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Derive <code>Clone</code> for <code>DecodeError</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/b4fc91325ec985e2a18e83e95a3c08eebd636af4\"><code>b4fc913</code></a> v0.13.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/bba4c5d11e3b5f0974d7d126342e0ca67bb4cc1f\"><code>bba4c5d</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/issues/145\">#145</a> from marshallpierce/mp/cleanup</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/42967320b3c675c8ae5d3d46dd6e6aea4a7fc970\"><code>4296732</code></a> Add docs and other cleanup</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/6bb35566333bd4c2cc74b8b820af5bfcda12a1b8\"><code>6bb3556</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/issues/144\">#144</a> from untitaker/invalid-bytes-not-length</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/5b40e0c04ed522d10cfeaae0f0b343dd3e6f1d4d\"><code>5b40e0c</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/issues/142\">#142</a> from marshallpierce/mp/string-writer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/8b1ae22babb33a5c7cee84f0445434bff6880c76\"><code>8b1ae22</code></a> Rename StrWrite to StrConsumer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/27ccb6591e22dbe81840268feec0917feaaebd97\"><code>27ccb65</code></a> fix tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/d15cd384e1a91fa73a7c57f30d4b76df2149df68\"><code>d15cd38</code></a> Give better error messages when decoding data with trailing newlines</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/5a56885c655deb54ccb206165e8351b0476c78b8\"><code>5a56885</code></a> Introduce StrWriter to allow ESW to wrap both a String and a &amp;mut String</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/commit/2dc0296d2a0c01387f6361c4c710f7d0c9e9aee2\"><code>2dc0296</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/issues/143\">#143</a> from marshallpierce/mp/invalid-length-doc</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

always discarded the layout states, but since we want to calculate layout states every frame, it makes a lot more sense to keep the layout state around and just update it. All of the original API is retained, so you are not forced to actually update your layout states. However the code for creating a new layout state now initializes a default state and updates it, instead of directly creating it correctly. This might slightly slow down initial creation, but we don't want to basically duplicate the same code across initial creation and updating.\r\n\r\nBy doing this an average frame now has 0 allocations, reallocations and deallocations. We are seeing speedups of around 3x - 5x in the newly added benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThis also introduces a new `ClearVec` type that behaves like a normal `Vec` but when clearing it, instead of dropping all the elements, it just keeps them around and clears them instead. So if you had a `Vec<String>` and cleared it, all the Strings would get deallocated, while a `ClearVec<String>` would keep them around and just set their length back to 0. We use this in a few places to reduce the chances of us needing to allocate new memory. It might make sense to move it into its own crate eventually as this should be a useful type for any kind of Rust code.\r\n\r\nResolves #54 ", "reactions": {"url":

(<code>DecoderReader</code>) to let users transparently decoded data from a b64 input source</li>\n<li>IMAP's modified b64 alphabet</li>\n<li>Relaxed type restrictions to just <code>AsRef&lt;[ut8]&gt;</code> for main <code>encode*</code>/<code>decode*</code> functions</li>\n<li>A minor performance improvement in encoding</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.11.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum rust version 1.34.0</li>\n<li><code>no_std</code> is now supported via the two new features <code>alloc</code> and <code>std</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum rust version 1.27.2</li>\n<li>Fix bug in streaming encoding (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/pull/90\">#90</a>): if the underlying writer didn't write all the bytes given to it, the remaining bytes would not be retried later. See the docs on <code>EncoderWriter::write</code>.</li>\n<li>Make it configurable whether or not to return an error when decoding detects excess trailing bits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap\">line-wrap</a> crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n<ul>\n<li><code>Base64Display</code> creation no longer uses a <code>Result</code> because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\nconfigs that <code>unwrap()</code> for you are no longer needed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add a streaming encoder <code>Write</code> impl to transparently base64 as you write.</li>\n<li>Remove the remaining <code>unsafe</code> code.</li>\n<li>Remove whitespace stripping to simplify <code>no_std</code> support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: <code>filter(|b| !b&quot; \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c&quot;.contains(b)</code>.</li>\n<li>Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.3</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update safemem</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Derive <code>Clone</code> for <code>DecodeError</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for <code>crypt(3)</code>'s base64 variant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><code>decode_config_slice</code> function for no-allocation decoding, analogous to <code>encode_config_slice</code></li>\n<li>Decode performance optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.8.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><code>encode_config_slice</code> function for no-allocation encoding</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.7.0</h1>\n</tr></table> ...
