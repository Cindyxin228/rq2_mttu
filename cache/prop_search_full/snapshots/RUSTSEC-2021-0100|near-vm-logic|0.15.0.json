Applying one delta should move flat state head one block forward and properly update value refs for trie keys.\r\n\r\nThe approach is safe to use for chains without forks, but not safe otherwise because flat state should be properly locked during updates. Also it doesn't support garbage collection of old deltas. In following PRs, deltas will be used to support forks fully.\r\n\r\nHere we also add temporary support for moving flat state head forward to final blocks found on `get_deltas_between_blocks`, because otherwise localnet testing is too slow as it need to read all deltas from genesis.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Running loadtest on localnet with 4 shards - checked that it doesn't crash and block processing time is normal.\r\n* Existing runtime tests with `protocol_feature_flat_state` enabled - e.g. `test_trie_and_flat_state_equality`\r\n* TODO: tune dedicated pipeline for it https://buildkite.com/nearprotocol/nearcore-flat-state", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/7604/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/7604/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/7590", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/7590/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/7590/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/7590/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7590", "id": 1367064850, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCQUkYs4-o6K2", "number": 7590, "title": "feat: prefetch accounts and access keys", "user": {"login": "jakmeier", "id": 6342444, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI0NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342444?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier", "html_url": "https://github.com/jakmeier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jakmeier/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-09-08T22:43:54Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-22T14:30:41Z", "closed_at": "2022-09-14T13:03:44Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/pulls/7590", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7590", "diff_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7590.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7590.patch", "merged_at": "2022-09-14T13:03:44Z"}, "body": "Introduces the concept of prefetching data from the DB while applying chunks.\r\n\r\nThis is non-speculative prefetching only for now.

In general, prefetching how it has been implemented is (supposed to be) invisible in all possible ways, other than trie storage latency.\r\n\r\nPerformance wise, this is going to make the worst-case assumption for all action receipts better. The worst case is that two accounts and one access keys have to be fetched from disk for every receipt.
