`rdkafka` and `http` dependencies, as well as fix a `base64` deprecation warning.\r\nI'm not sure about the versioning policy. The `rdkafka` minor bump doesn't cause any breaking changes for this repo, but maybe it would for downstream users?. I'm happy to keep this at `0.8.0` (since it hasn't been released yet), or maybe `0.8.1`. Let me know what you prefer, @jcrossley3 or @Lazzaretti.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit (2025/01/01): The tokio team released [axum version 0.8.0](https://tokio.rs/blog/2025-01-01-announcing-axum-0-8-0), so I included that in this PR. \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cloudevents/sdk-rust/issues/249/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":

building out a `kn func` project for WASI using WASMEdge\r\nhttps://github.com/uirlis/func-rust-wasi/tree/main/cloudevents \r\n\r\nAs part of that work I have put together a first pass at getting cloudevents to compile for WASI which is this PR.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work is redefining the features in the Cargo.toml to bring in hyper-wasi when the OS is `wasi`\r\n\r\n~~However I had to patch `rust-claim` in the test suite as the `autocfg` doesn't play well with a hyper-wasi so this placeholder is used\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-rust/compare/main...No9:wasi-support?expand=1#diff-2e9d962a08321605940b5a657135052fbcef87b5e360662bb527c96d9a615542R74. \r\nWhich points to this patch \r\nhttps://github.com/svartalf/rust-claim/compare/master...No9:rust-claim:ignore-autocfg-wasi~~\r\nNo longer an issue as latest active claims repo has been added.\r\n\r\nTo build and run this PR you will need: \r\nWASMEdge installed - https://wasmedge.org/book/en/quick_start/install.html \r\nWASI Tools for Rust - `cargo install cargo-wasi`\r\nSet the was env - `export CARGO_TARGET_WASM32_WASI_RUNNER=wasmedge`\r\n\r\nCurrently this PR should pass testing with with the following command that enables the features used in the sample kn project\r\n```\r\ncargo test --features \"http-binding hyper hyper_wasi\" --target=wasm32-wasi\r\n... \r\ntest result: ok. 57 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out\r\n\r\nrunning 2 tests\r\ntest test_html_root_url ... ignored\r\ntest test_readme_deps ... ignored\r\n\r\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 2 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the main contribution command `cargo test --all-features --all` also passes\r\n\r\nBut the main contribution command with `wasm32-wasi` fails as expected with numerous errors.\r\n```\r\ncargo build --all-features --all --target=wasm32-wasi \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is of interest and we can work out what to do about `claim` I'm happy working on the CI pieces to finalise.\r\nAlso understand if this is using projects that are  too nascent and you want to keep it down stream for a while.
