fix #357, but uses an alternative approach to #358.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the behaviour will be as follows:\r\n```rs\r\nmod foo {\r\n    pub mod bar {\r\n        use paperclip::actix::{web, api_v2_operation, Apiv2Schema};\r\n        use serde::Serialize;\r\n\r\n        #[derive(Serialize, Apiv2Schema)]\r\n        pub struct Response {\r\n            bar: i32\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        #[api_v2_operation]\r\n        pub fn b() -> web::Json<Response> {\r\n            web::Json(Response { bar: 10 })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nresults in the following spec:\r\n```yaml\r\n  foo_bar_Response:\r\n    type: object\r\n    properties:\r\n      bar:\r\n        type: integer\r\n        format: int32\r\n    required:\r\n      - bar\r\n...\r\n          schema:\r\n            $ref: '#/definitions/foo_bar_Response' \r\n```\r\nThe advantage of this PR over #358 is that the generated spec is always the same for the same input code.\r\n\r\nThe name is determined by taking the output of `std::module_path!()`, removing the first 'component' (i.e. the crate name), then joining with `_` as a separator.\r\n\r\nThis **will not** break code backwards compatibility, but it **will** break spec backwards compatibility, i.e. the generated spec is different from how it would be without this PR", "reactions": {"url":

This lets you convert integer values to your enum. If you specify a #[repr(..)] attribute on your enum, or use\nan explicit discriminant, this will be incorporated into the derive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>from_repr</code> will be <code>const</code> if you use a recent rust version.</li>\n<li>This cannot be a trait method currently because only inherent methods support <code>const</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/186\">#186</a> Automatically implement <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for enums that implement <code>EnumString</code>.\nThis is only enabled for rustc &gt;= 1.34 which is when `TryFrom was stabilized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a small breaking change. If you had manually implemented <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for your enum, this will cause a conflict. You\ncan probably remove your manual implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/189\">#189</a> Use <code>core::result::Result</code> instead of <code>std::result::Result</code>.

This lets you convert integer values to your enum. If you specify a #[repr(..)] attribute on your enum, or use\nan explicit discriminant, this will be incorporated into the derive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>from_repr</code> will be <code>const</code> if you use a recent rust version.</li>\n<li>This cannot be a trait method currently because only inherent methods support <code>const</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/186\">#186</a> Automatically implement <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for enums that implement <code>EnumString</code>.\nThis is only enabled for rustc &gt;= 1.34 which is when `TryFrom was stabilized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a small breaking change. If you had manually implemented <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for your enum, this will cause a conflict. You\ncan probably remove your manual implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/189\">#189</a> Use <code>core::result::Result</code> instead of <code>std::result::Result</code>. This should be\nmore portable in no-std environments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.22.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/180\">#180</a>: Deprecates <code>ToString</code> derive. You should use <code>Display</code>\ninstead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/178\">#178</a>: Deprecates AsStaticStr. This has been undocumented for a while.\nThe recommended method is to derive <code>IntoStaticStr</code> instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/171\">#171</a>: Improve <code>no-std</code> support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/170\">#170</a>: enable changing the path to strum traits. This is necessary\nif you re-export strum as a submodule in another crate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.21.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/164\">#164</a> Improve compatibility with older versions of <code>syn</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.21.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Replace <code>std::</code> with <code>core::</code> to support no-std projects. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/145\">#145</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breaking Changes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MSRV is updated to 1.32 because <code>heck</code> does not work in <code>1.31.1</code> anymore. Rust 1.32 came out Jan 2019 so hopefully\nteams have moved to an equal or newer version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/149\">#149</a> Remove the &quot;rename&quot; feature. In Rust 2018, macros should be\nimported using a qualified path to avoid collisions. <code>strum_macros::EnumString</code> rather than using the &quot;Rename&quot;\nfeature to avoid collisions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/160\">#160</a> enum messages: Make the returned values all 'static\n<ul>\n<li>It is unlikely this will break anyone, but the new signature for functions generated by EnumMessage\nis <code>fn get_message(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'static str&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for ascii_case_insensitive string comparisons. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/157\">#157</a>\nThis feature allows <code>FromString</code> impls to match strings that differ in case from the expected variant.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">strum_macros's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>0.20.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: EnumVariantNames now properly adjusts to the <code>to_string</code> and <code>serialize</code> attributes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.19.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a regression using <code>nth_back</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/85\">#85</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added repository to Cargo.toml. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/90\">#90</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Correctly handle fill align in <code>Display</code> impls. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/95\">#95</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: Use Associated Constant for EnumCount instead of const fn and free constant. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/99\">#99</a>\nThis behavior is consistent with the other derives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breaking Change</strong>. <code>default</code> and <code>disabled</code> should now be written as markers instead of key value pairs.\nHere is the old way of adding these attributes to a variant.</p>\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>// OLD WAY\nenum Test {\n  #[strum(disabled = &quot;true&quot;, default = &quot;true&quot;)]\n  Variant(String)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the new way. There is less ambiguity in the new syntax.</p>\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>enum Test {\n  #[strum(disabled, default)]\n  Variant(String)\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breaking Change</strong>. Most of the strum plugins will now error more aggresively on invalid options being\nused. Historically, the plugins have ignore invalid options, but most of these should error now. Silent\nerrors are a rust anti-pattern.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.18.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only copy across <code>&quot;doc&quot;, &quot;cfg&quot;, &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;deny&quot;</code> attributes from main enum variants to discriminant variants. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/issues/73\">#73</a></li>\n<li>The formatting of generated serialization variants returned by <code>get_serializations()</code> from an\nenum that derives <code>EnumMessage</code> is now affected by the <code>serialize_all</code> property on the enum.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/84\">#84</a></li>\n<li>IntoEnumIterator now has the constraint <code>IntoEnumIterator::Iterator&lt;Item=Self&gt;</code> and <code>Self: Sized</code>. This makes\nit much easier to be generic over <code>IntoEnumIterator</code> and enum variants must be sized. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/issues/80\">#80</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.17.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue caused by combining <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/60\">#60</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/76\">#76</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.17.0</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/Peternator7/strum/commits\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
