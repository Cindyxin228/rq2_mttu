Transport/Token API to be event based (#214), and in the process, replaces `hidapi` with a homebrew implementation. The branch is called `mozilla-hid` because my original plan was to base it on `authenticator-rs`, but in the end I've rewritten most of that.\r\n\r\nI'm only targetting Linux, macOS and Windows for now.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n* New USB HID API bindings (`fido-hid-rs`):\r\n  * on Linux, this uses udev and the kernel hidraw interface\r\n  * on macOS, this uses IOKit\r\n  * on Windows, this uses the UWP HID API (available on Windows 10 and later); `hidapi` and `authenticator-rs` used the older Windows 2000 APIs which are not async friendly\r\n\r\n* Add event-based API for device enumeration (`Transport::watch_tokens()`), moved Bluetooth and NFC transports to it.\r\n\r\n  This is now the only way to enumerate tokens for Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n* Started adding Bluetooth support to `fido-key-manager`. This is only really reliable on macOS at the moment.\r\n\r\n* NFC: work around a bug where macOS' login manager tries to access the PIV applet on tokens *that we have an exclusive connection to*, which causes some tokens to reset (if the command arrives after `SELECT FIDO` but before other commands).\r\n\r\n* Implement selection for CTAP 2.0/2.1-PRE authenticators\r\n\r\nTODO list:\r\n\r\n* [x] finish migrating fido-key-manager to the new API\r\n* [x] finish migrating examples to the new API\r\n* [x] consistently use tokio's threading/workers for USB backends rather than `std::thread`\r\n* [x] figure out if the platform-specific USB stuff needs to be its own crate to handle optional platform-specific dependencies\r\n* [x] clean up commented out code\r\n* [x] check Bluetooth device filtering works correctly on all platforms\r\n* [x] merge #328\r\n* [x] merge #329 \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated
