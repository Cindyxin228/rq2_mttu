things (e.g. jetbrains), and made dialogs spawn more centered (e.g. non-resizable dialogs will now spawn centered on the workspace). I will add some other small bugs fixes in here, if you have any let me know.\r\n\r\nThis now has an automatic way of getting refresh rate with xrandr. And the limit is moved to event_translate to optimise a bit, as instead of mostly processing an event then ignoring it we ignored as soon as it comes in.\r\n\r\nFixes #497, fixes #574. I have also removed an issue where a fullscreen window's drop down menus would be buggy, by removing the move to top for fullscreen windows. This also allows child dialogs and such to appear above the fullscreen window easier (without also being buggy). This however has the issue of windows which have override redirect set to true (we completely ignore these windows) may appear over the fullscreen window, e.g. the polybar window tray often has override redirect set to true. I prefer these windows appearing above compared to the apps being buggy and slow to response (To 100% clarify the bugginess is due to the constant move to top).\r\n\r\nThe issues with unmanaged window appearing above fullscreen windows is now fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/571/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh":

\r\n\r\nSo this is finally the goal: separating core logic from binary logic. The core logic will allow other tiling manager to be based on leftwm. It will also allow people to make their own specific tiling manager (this is my personal intention).\r\n\r\nWith this change you can see that the optional dependencies of \"cli\" are now not optional anymore and moved to the crate `leftwm`. On the other hand, `leftwm-core` will see its dependencies reduce: all cli's feature dependencies but also anyhow, toml, liquid, shellexpand. The more reduced, the better (for projects who use leftwm but will make different choices). This will improve in future PR but I want to keep this one strictly about the splitting.\r\n\r\nThe \"common\" module has now become the `leftwm`'s lib. This allows easy access and resolve a few \"dead_code\" warnings.\r\n\r\n### The downside\r\n\r\nThe split means that you will need to maintain and publish 2 crates on crates.io. You can use [`cargo-release`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release) to help you on that. I personally usually do the command `cargo release --workspace --no-dev-version minor` (or major or patch). I suggest to keep the version of the 2 crates synchronized as it is easier to maintain but you can have different version if you want. If you want you can add me to owner and I will do the first publish of everything for you.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leftwm/leftwm/issues/513/reactions", "total_count": 3,

The next one will be mostly about moving things around and the one after should be more scoped to specific issues.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- move independent functions to `Manager`\r\n- move event loop to `Manager`\r\n- merge lib's `ThemeSetting` into lib's `Config`\r\n- move theme loading/unloading commands to bin's custom commands\r\n- removed ExternalCommand in favor of `Command`\r\n- proper types for `Command`\r\n- ~add a generic type for implementing custom commands~ add an `Other(String)` variant for implementing custom commands\r\n- introduce anyhow for the bin to simplify error handling (some coloring has been lost... oh well)\r\n- better logs when sending command to unix pipe\r\n- really happy with all the stuff clippy found this time, great\r\n- move `Config` instance and `DisplayServer` instance to `Manager`, the worker's code is greatly simplified\r\n- introduce `thiserror` to simplify error declarations\r\n- dropped ErrorKind (I didn't see any value)", "reactions":
