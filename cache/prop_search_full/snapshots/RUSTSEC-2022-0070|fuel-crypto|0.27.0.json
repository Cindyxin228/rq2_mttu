It removes some public functions from `fuel-crypto` primitives that may cause compilation errors.\r\n* Read contract directly into memory by @freesig in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/342 - Adds new traits `StorageSize`, `StorageRead`, `StorageWrite` into `fuel-storage`. The `fuel-vm` requires `InterpreterStorage` to implement those traits now, which can cause compilation errors.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* Fix panics in fuel-vm for exponent or bitshift larger than u32::MAX by @Dentosal in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/344\r\n* Do not allow setting reserved flags by @Dentosal in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/363\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**:

carrying over https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-crypto/pull/36 which aimed to address https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-crypto/issues/35, though after noticing a few other instances of the same issue decided to take a closer look throughout the crate.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes many of the unsafe constructors exposed in the `fuel-crypto` API, some due to the implementations not actually being `unsafe`, and some due to a revised implementation that safely encapsulates the unsafe behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe `Message` and `Signature` `from_bytes` and `from_bytes_ref` constructors have been documented to clarify expectations that they expect signature or cryptographically hashed data respectively.\r\n\r\nThe `PublicKey` and `SecretKey` `from_bytes_unchecked` constructors have been made private in order to ensure holding an instance of one of these types guarantees their inner byte arrays at least satisfies the curve.\r\n\r\nThe original, custom curve-checking functions have been removed in favour of using the secp256k1 library constructors directly which share the same implementation but with an added range check that is likely to get optimised out due to the use of const-sized arrays anyway.\r\n\r\nAdds some missing `#[repr(transparent)]` decorators to `fuel-types`.\r\n\r\nThe `FuelMnemonic` type provided unnecessary indirection between the user and the free function, and has been removed in favour of exposing the function directly from the crate root.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/346/reactions",

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/301. \r\nUsing the lifetimes in the trait or associated types of `Mappable` added complexity several times that forced the change like [this](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/blob/5727a2e7aa5ac0522d7ebd7a6bfd2df5b90e41d8/fuel-vm/src/interpreter/diff/storage.rs#L75) or [this](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/318/commits/a47439f06afb12c18cac6e38938faa1fdeef21bd). Those changes could be done differently, but still it would still be nice to know the owned type to simplify future development and not look for more complex solutions.\r\n\r\n## The change to solve the problem\r\n\r\nRenamed `Mappable::GetValue` into `Mappable::OwnedValue`. In the same way, added the `Mappable::OwnedKey` for `Mappable::Key` to know the owned type for key and value. Added `ToOwned` bounds for the `Key` and `Value`, added `From<ToOwned::Owned>` bound for `OwnedKey` and `OwnedValue`:\r\n```rust\r\n    type Key = Self::OwnedKey;\r\n    type OwnedKey = u64;\r\n    type Value = Self::OwnedValue;\r\n    type OwnedValue = Primitive;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the definition of the `Mappable` connects the `Key` with `OwnedKey` and `Value` with `OwnedValue` and allows easy conversion from reference into owned type.\r\n\r\nAdding those bounds doesn't allow conversion between `(&'a ..., &'a ...)` and owned `(..., ...)` tuples. So I removed lifetime `'a` and replaced the tuples with the new double storage key.\r\n\r\nDefined two double storage keys for `ContractsAssets` and `ContractsState`.", "reactions": {"url":
