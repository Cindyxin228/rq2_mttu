evaluations. Importantly, this PR enables the following:\r\n- Users will now be able to execute an `evaluate_llm` function that takes a batch of `LLMEvalRecords`, user-defined `LLMEvalMetrics` that will be used to run an `LLM as a judge` workflow and an optional `EvaluationConfig`.\r\n- The `EvaluationConfig` provides opt-in functionality for calculating embeddings from user-defined targets, computing similarity and performing clustering to identify unique clusters for metrics and computed metrics. \r\n- More information is in the documentation", "reactions": {"url":

There is now a shared `TaskState` behind an `RWLock` for each Queue that is shared across the `ScouterQueue` and is used to manage each task. As part of this refactor, a cancellation token has been introduced based on recommended best practices from [tokio](https://tokio.rs/tokio/topics/shutdown). When shutdown is called, the cancellation token will be cancelled. This event is picked up by the `event_handler`, which then flushes the queue before exiting. For `Custom` and `Psi` profile types that use an additional `background_handler` for continual polling, an additional cancellation token is also provided.", "reactions": {"url":

`LLMDriftConfig`, `LLMDriftAlertConfig` and `LLMetric`\r\n- The `LLMMetric` is the primary method for creating a metric to attach to an LLM workflow. The idea being simple (hopefully). User creates an `LLMMetric` that includes a prompt and expected named parameters to be injected into the prompt. When a user creates a drift profile, `Scouter` will create a rust-serializable workflow that will then be saved with the profile. Whenever a user pushes an `LLMRecord` to the `ScouterQueue`, which pushes the record to the server, this record will be parsed and the context will be injected into the workflow, which will then run on the server and metrics will be extracted. The full implementation is written out in the docs\r\n- Sql:\r\n   - `llm_drift_record` table that stores the raw records containing context\r\n   - `llm_drift` table that contains the metrics associated with a given llm metric workflow\r\n   - Corresponding rust structs for inserting and getting records from these tables\r\n   - Archiving logic for both tables\r\n- Server:\r\n   - Polling task that scans for `LLMRecords` and processes them according to the drift profile workflow\r\n - Client:\r\n   - Added python stubs for new classes\r\n   - Added new queue type for LLMs", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/issues/127/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/issues/127/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/issues/123", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/issues/123/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/issues/123/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/issues/123/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/demml/scouter/pull/123", "id": 3240454368, "node_id": "PR_kwDOLOYXQ86fbTtd", "number": 123, "title": "Cleanup/env vars", "user": {"login": "thorrester", "id": 48217609, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjE3NjA5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48217609?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester", "html_url": "https://github.com/thorrester", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thorrester/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-07-17T18:05:18Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-17T18:57:22Z", "closed_at": "2025-07-17T18:57:19Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/demml/scouter/pulls/123", "html_url": "https://github.com/demml/scouter/pull/123", "diff_url": "https://github.com/demml/scouter/pull/123.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/demml/scouter/pull/123.patch", "merged_at": "2025-07-17T18:57:19Z"}, "body": "## Pull Request\r\n\r\n### Short Summary\r\n- Cleaning up som env vars for kafka.

was closing before the background loop could send the startup notification. This resulted in unreliable queue initialization.\r\n\r\n**Resolution:**  \r\n- The background function is now spawned and executed during queue creation, ensuring the startup notification is sent reliably.\r\n- The background task function now returns an error if the queue cannot be created, improving error handling.\r\n- There is now a new `Event::Init` event that is used to determine if the loop has been initialized.\r\n\r\n**Additional Improvements:**  \r\n- Enhanced error messages to provide more context for easier debugging.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: #101\r\n---", "reactions": {"url":

Logic in `PostgresClient` has been broken out to various traits that are grouped based on use-case (e.g. psi, spc, user, archive, etc)\r\n  - This will make the client easier to reason about and maintain\r\n  -

Every 30 seconds, the `Observer` collects metrics and push them out via `http`, `kafka` or `rabbitmq`\r\n- Adds FastAPI integration that adds custom middleware to a fastapi apps where the middleware
