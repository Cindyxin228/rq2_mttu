wide issue of validators missing chunks.\r\n\r\nLogging changes are directed to making it easier to see why a node might have missed a chunk or a partial encoded chunk.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of investigation:\r\nValidators are missing chunks, because they are in a syncing state.\r\nUnclear why the validator nodes are in a syncing state.\r\n\r\nTested by running a testnet node.\r\nThe logs

validation.\r\nI want to combine creation of necessary `StoreUpdate` with validation, because to validate `EpochSyncInfo` we need to rebuild `BlockMerkleTree` for every block in the epoch, but also not commit it if anything goes bad, and that is supported in `ChainStoreUpdate`.\r\nCreation of `StoreUpdate` is already a big change, so I want to do a separate PR for it.\r\nTo test that we process `EpochSyncInfo` correctly I create a VERY hacky test, that should not be included in CI ever. Right now it works as intended, but if we change implementation of any sync, we will have to rewrite this test.\r\nI hope I will add epoch sync into `run_sync_step` flow soon enough for us to replace this test with something stable before we need to rewrite unstable test.

An account is created at this address.\r\n2. The account does not have any access key added. Thus, it is not possible to make a transaction from this account directly.\r\n3. The Wallet Contract (as a part of the protocol) is deployed to the account. For this PR, an empty smart contract is used as a placeholder.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- On a transfer to an ETH-implicit address, if an account does not exist yet at this address:\r\n   - Create account at this address.\r\n   - Deploy a `Wallet Contract` placeholder (empty contract now) to this account.\r\n- Update fee for a transfer to an ETH-implicit address to include account creation cost. `Wallet Contract` deployment is free of charge (user only pays for an increased storage).\r\n- Tests:\r\n   - Test whether it is possible to create an ETH-implicit account by making a transfer to that address, and whether further funds can be sent to this account.\r\n   - Test that no access key is added to an ETH-implicit account (the account is locked) and in consequence no transactions are possible from this account.\r\n- Guard the changes with `EthImplicitAccounts` protocol feature and `eth_implicit_accounts` runtime config flag.\r\n\r\n## Next work\r\n- Discuss how the `Wallet Contract` should be integrated into the protocol for efficiency.\r\n- Use the `Wallet Contract` placeholder implementation that allows to transfer funds only.", "reactions": {"url":
