rather than adding more and more customization into the library itself. `xwin` was never intended as a library, but since people are using it that way, I don't think it's a good idea to have the HTTP client customization in the library, especially since it's reading environment variables which IMO is not something libraries should do in most cases. This is a bit unfortunate since it means callers have to have their own code if they want to customize, but it means this crate is simpler, and caller's are free to make whatever decisions they want (other than HTTP client, but that's something that can be done later).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/110/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/110/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/109", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/109/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/109/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/109/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/109", "id": 1987793098, "node_id": "PR_kwDOF2eRFM5fJmsB", "number": 109, "title": "Add feature flag rustls-tls for custom ca feature", "user": {"login": "Owen-CH-Leung", "id": 43698890, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjk4ODkw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43698890?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung", "html_url": "https://github.com/Owen-CH-Leung", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Owen-CH-Leung/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-10T15:00:46Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-11T16:12:05Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-11T16:12:04Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pulls/109", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/109", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/109.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/109.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-11T16:12:04Z"}, "body": "Apology for the back-and-forth - As per the comment [here](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-xwin/pull/80#issuecomment-1805414088), I learnt that the upstream project `maturin` creates the python wheels by using the feature flag `rustls-tls`.

for windows (defaults to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) wrapped in `strace` so that xwin can detect all file accesses to headers and libraries in the crt and sdk, and writing only those accessed files to a map file. This map file can then be used with a `splat` to _only_ splat and symlink the files listed in map file.\r\n\r\nThis results in a vastly smaller splat output eg. from 577 MiB -> 105 MiB for a large internal project that includes a significant amount of C/C++ code.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a `--sdk-version` and `--crt-version` so allow users to explicitly specify the sdk/crt to use, rather than the default behavior of always using the latest version detected in the manifest used. This was primarily done due to some CRT in the latest version required clang 16+, from the previous lowest version being 11, which can be too much of a jump for some people.\r\n\r\nResolves: #85\r\nResolves: #84\r\nResolves: #28", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/issues/99/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99", "id": 1891879224, "node_id": "PR_kwDOF2eRFM5aGHv_", "number": 99, "title": "Default to manifest 17", "user": {"login": "Jake-Shadle", "id": 2316028, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTYwMjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316028?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-09-12T07:43:25Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-12T08:08:41Z", "closed_at": "2023-09-12T08:08:41Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pulls/99", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/pull/99.patch", "merged_at": "2023-09-12T08:08:40Z"}, "body": "This resolves an issue where there is _one_ (SIGH) file that exists in both the regular SDK headers and the Store headers.

`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.BuildTools` package.\r\nA dependency with a CRT version is expected to begin with `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.` and end with `.x86.x64`.\r\nThe latest version is determined by string ordering.\r\nIn the current `17.4.1` version of the manifest, there is a dependency `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Modules.x86.x64`, so xwin determines that the latest CRT version is `Modules`.\r\n\r\nExecuting\r\n```\r\nxwin --accept-license --manifest-version=17 download\r\n```\r\ncauses an error\r\n```\r\nError: unable to find CRT headers item 'Microsoft.VC.Modules.CRT.Headers.base'\r\n```\r\nxwin can't find `Microsoft.VC.{crt_version}.CRT.Headers.base` package in the manifest because `{crt_version}` is `Modules`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Potential problem with string ordering\r\n\r\nString ordering might fail on some version numbers,\r\ne.g. if the dependencies are\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.15.9.x86.x64\r\nMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.15.10.x86.x64\r\n```\r\nthe latest version will be determined as

ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## List of existing versions from currently available manifests\r\n\r\nMight be useful to determine if changes from this pull request are needed.\r\nLooks like recent \"CRT version\" is just a concatenation of `14.*` real CRT version and manifest version (which matches Visual Studio version) and they usually increase simultaneously.\r\nString ordering might work if there will be no major CRT version increase.\r\n\r\n### CRT versions\r\n\r\n`15.9.51` manifest (matching
