Opening for comments\u2014feel free to critique the direction etc and tell me to throw it all out if it's not what you're looking for! Leaving a few checkboxes\u2026\r\n\r\nA new default feature `\"encoding\"` opts in to using the appropriate character encoding.\r\n- In native binaries, `encoding_rs` is used. If you know you're only talking to an API that always uses utf-8, you can turn off this feature and save the binary size that is taken up by the encoding tables.\r\n- In WebAssembly, it calls out to the `TextDecoder` API. AFAIK This always makes a copy, so you can turn it off if you don't want to copy big strings between JS and wasm.\r\n  - [x] We could optimize this for the utf-8 case by using `String::from_utf8()` directly if the charset is utf-8, and only use TextDecoder for other less common  encodings.\r\n\r\nTurning off the `\"encoding\"` feature reverts to the current behaviour, which is assuming utf-8.\r\n- [x] This should likely check that the charset is utf-8, and refuse to decode it if it is anything else, to avoid garbage output.\r\n\r\nThis patch also assumes utf-8 if no charset is specified in the response headers.\r\n- [x] By spec the default encoding should be iso-8859-1, but in practice it's not. Need to figure out the best approach here.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces an error type that's quite unlike anything Surf has right now, so I'm not sure if that direction fits in with the design. I also wrapped the new error type in an `io::ErrorKind::InvalidData` everywhere which is mostly cargo culting, I don't think that's actually necessary? I carried it over from the old `body_string()` implementation, where it _did_ make sense.\r\n- [x] probably get rid of that wrapping", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/issues/108/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/issues/108/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/issues/89", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/issues/89/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/issues/89/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/issues/89/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/surf/pull/89", "id": 518585886, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzM3NDUzOTY0", "number": 89, "title": "update rustasync -> http-rs", "user": {"login": "yoshuawuyts", "id": 2467194, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjcxOTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2467194?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts", "html_url": "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-11-06T16:30:06Z", "updated_at": "2019-11-06T16:43:27Z", "closed_at": "2019-11-06T16:43:21Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/surf/pulls/89", "html_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/surf/pull/89", "diff_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/surf/pull/89.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/surf/pull/89.patch", "merged_at": "2019-11-06T16:43:21Z"}, "body": "Closes #88.
