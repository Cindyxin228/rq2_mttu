MacOS `brew install shared-mime-info`\r\n            1. `arm64` MacOS requires `tree_magic_mini` [fork](https://github.com/you54f/tree_magic) \r\n         3. Linux - Debian`apt-get install -y shared-mime-info`\r\n4. If either result returns `text/plain`, then manually read bytes using `detect_content_type_from_bytes` function in `pact_models`\r\n5. If all of `2`, `3`, or `4` fails, then throw error, otherwise return `Ok`\r\n\r\ncertainly better ways to implement this, but wanted to make sure I had a full round trip in all the consuming languages, and could remove the content-type hacks there.\r\n\r\nThe plus side is we have consistent behaviour in all of our test examples, on all supported platforms and architectures (win/lin/mac arm64 and amd64) without the use of tree_magic and the existence of shared-mime-info (which is great for container users, and great for avoiding GPL woes) \r\n\r\nRust libraries used:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/mbrubeck/tree_magic\r\n  - fork https://github.com/you54f/tree_magic (for m1 support), PR raised\r\n- https://github.com/bojand/infer\r\n- Explore (not used but worth a look at) - https://github.com/ebassi/xdg-mime-rs\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n\r\n1) Do we need tree_magic_mini, I don't seem to hit that check in the wild\r\n2) We probably want some vendored format examples that are harder to detect\r\n3) Provide user full opt-out of content-type matching, in case of things going weird?\r\n\r\nNotes to merger\r\n\r\n1) will need updating in pact_mock_server (use of pact_matching) which is then used in this repo, so I believe we will need to build/release pact_matching to crates.io, update pact_mock_server, release, and then back to pact_ref to do the works there\r\n\r\nTested in \r\n\r\n- pact rust\r\n- pact rust compat suite\r\n- pact-js-core\r\n  - https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-js-core/pull/42\r\n  - https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-js-core/pull/43\r\n- pact-js\r\n  - https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-js/pull/1\r\n- pact-php\r\n  - https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-php/pull/1\r\n- pact-net\r\n  - https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-net/pull/1 \r\n- pact-ruby-ffi\r\n  - https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-ruby-ffi/pull/3", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/429/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/429/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/426", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/426/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/426/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/426/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/426", "id": 2310679274, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAyT0a85wNh91", "number": 426, "title": "Strip ANSI escapes from JUnit output", "user": {"login": "mjpieters", "id": 46775, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Nzc1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46775?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters", "html_url": "https://github.com/mjpieters", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjpieters/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-05-22T14:18:17Z", "updated_at": "2024-05-31T20:47:46Z", "closed_at": "2024-05-30T02:09:07Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pulls/426", "html_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/426", "diff_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/426.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/426.patch", "merged_at": "2024-05-30T02:09:06Z"}, "body": "When coloured output is enabled, output strings contain ANSI escapes, sequences of binary data that communicate with a terminal to control colours.
