allocations in draw calls by doing two things:\r\n\r\n1. By changing `VertexFormat` from `Cow<'static, [...]>` to a `&'static [...]`.\r\n2. Changing `vaos` from Vec to SmallVec of 3 elements.\r\n\r\n## VertexFormat\r\nNow, as far as I can tell from the comments in the code, this is something that the original author wanted to.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with the `Cow`? Well, first of all, it's useless - Cow::Borrowed was never constructed, and in every draw call it was [cloned](https://github.com/glium/glium/blob/9045bc1e9e4bbcc149be29078f28921ac413cd28/src/vertex_array_object.rs#LL152C64-L152C64), and `Cow::Owned::clone` clones the data, meaning it cloned the `Vec`.\r\n\r\nHow it's possible to use a static slice as a vertex format?\r\nThe main problem was adapting `implement_vertex` macro. Essentially a macro now has to create a const or static field, and in the trait implementation return it. To do this, the whole logic behind this const generation should also be const. This implies two things:\r\n1. Calculating field offset (`__glium_offset_of`). This is easily doable now, since `offset_from` on pointers is const in rust stable. The latest `memoffset` crate uses it, so `__glium_offset_of` is now also const\r\n2. Making `attr_type_of_val` const. This was a bit more complicated because it called a trait fn, and trait fn's can't be const. So I've adapted the trait, and now it has a const field. The other thing is `Option::map` which is not const, so I had to rewrite that to match.\r\n\r\n## vaos\r\n\r\nThe only place that writes vaos is [this](https://github.com/glium/glium/blob/9045bc1e9e4bbcc149be29078f28921ac413cd28/src/vertex_array_object.rs#L188), and `self.vertex_buffers` is already a `SmallVec` with 2 elements. Only one element is pushed there two lines later, meaning this Vec will always have a constant 3-element size. By changing data type we reduce 2 allocations (one in collect, and one in vec resize in push)\r\n\r\n\r\n## glium_derive\r\n\r\nglium/glium_derive#7", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2056/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2056/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2036", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2036/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2036/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2036/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2036", "id": 1516533612, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAXnp985GfxBF", "number": 2036, "title": "Update glutin to 0.30", "user": {"login": "Melchizedek6809", "id": 78289734, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4Mjg5NzM0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78289734?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809", "html_url": "https://github.com/Melchizedek6809", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Melchizedek6809/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 26, "created_at": "2023-01-02T16:04:21Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-10T02:17:44Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-10T02:17:43Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/pulls/2036", "html_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2036", "diff_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2036.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2036.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-10T02:17:43Z"}, "body": "Hey there,\r\n\r\nI've been working on updating glium to work with glutin 0.30 and things are looking quite well, I've added a new example `triangle-new` because glutin needs to be initialized quite differently. I also restructured the overall example so that everything gets setup on receiving a `Resume` Event and dropped when a `Suspend` Event arrives, this apparently should only happen on Android, but I thought that examples should probably promote the most reliable/safe way of handling things. \r\n\r\nApart from that I tried to keep changes to the API as little as possible, which is why I've added the `ContextSurfacePair` type. I've also experimented on another branch with just keeping the Context around, but that meant breaking the API since we can't make a Context current without a Surface, and we can't determine the size of the Framebuffer without a Surface.\r\n\r\nTwo other things where someone with more Rust experience may know of a better Solution:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a better/more efficient way of turning a `&str` into a `&CStr`? I'm currently doing the following:\r\n```rust\r\n#[inline]\r\nunsafe fn get_proc_address(&self, symbol: &str) -> *const c_void {\r\n    let symbol = CString::new(symbol).unwrap();\r\n    self.borrow().display().get_proc_address(&symbol) as *const _\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I'm not sure about the `'static` lifetime for the `Display` struct in `src/backend/glutin/mod.rs:82`, I have a gut feeling that this is wrong, but I'm too new to Rust to know for certain. \r\n\r\nOh and it currently only works on *nix Platforms, due to `glutin` not implementing `Surface::{width,height}` for CGL/WGL contexts which this implementation depends on, I'm looking into implementing that for glutin but wanted to create a draft request already since this might take some time.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2036/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2036/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2019", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2019/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2019/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/issues/2019/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2019", "id": 1323311325, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAXnp9848X78X", "number": 2019, "title": "Fix a bug in duplicate location checking", "user": {"login": "est31", "id": 8872119, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzIxMTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8872119?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31", "html_url": "https://github.com/est31", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-07-30T22:32:26Z", "updated_at": "2022-07-30T22:42:52Z", "closed_at": "2022-07-30T22:42:52Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/glium/glium/pulls/2019", "html_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2019", "diff_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2019.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/2019.patch", "merged_at": "2022-07-30T22:42:52Z"}, "body": "The code that checked for duplicate locations in #2013 didn't take into account when you don't specify the location.

crate to compile on current stable Rust. It exports two derive macros, corresponding to the `Vertex` and `Uniform` traits in `glium`. The implementation for `Vertex` is exactly the same as in the previously available code; the implementation for `Uniform` was changed according to the change in the trait itself.\r\n\r\nNote that the derived implementations are _not_ tested for correctness yet (and they will surely change, since at least one part of them currently seems to be unsound); the only test currently present is a \"smoke\" test, showing that the derive can be compiled.
