implements signed ZIP files. I was hoping to attract a few more eyeballs before I invest more time. \ud83d\udc40 \r\n\r\nThe idea is that even if your github credentials are compromised, and some evil actor can upload malicious releases in your name, then hopefully your private key was not compromised also. Without the private key an upload cannot be signed and the self update will intentionally fail.\r\n\r\nThe signature gets stored as the first 64 bytes of a ZIP file. This is possible because ZIP files have their \"header\" at the end of the file, and they can be prepended by any and all content. This feature is also used in e.g. self-extracting ZIP files.\r\n\r\nThe signatures use [ed25519](https://crates.io/crates/ed25519-dalek). In <https://github.com/Kijewski/zipsign> I am implementing a tool to craft signed ZIP files:\r\n\r\n* install \"zipsign\"\r\n* `zipsign gen-key my-private.key my-public.key`\r\n* sign an archive of your program(s):\r\n  * create a `.zip` and/or `.tar.gz` of your program(s) with whatever tool you are already using\r\n  * `zipsign sign zip my-program.zip my-private.key`\r\n  * `zipsign sign tar my-program.tar.gz my-private.key`\r\n* verify that an archive is correctly signed\r\n  * `zipsign verify zip my-program.zip my-public.key`\r\n  * `zipsign verify tar my-program.tar.gz my-public.key`\r\n\r\nShortcomings:\r\n\r\n* You cannot sign uncompressed `.tar` files, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.xz`, `.tar.zstd` or `.tar.Z`.\r\n\r\nSo, what do y'all think? Is this PR on the right track?\r\n\r\nCloses #85, closes #111.
