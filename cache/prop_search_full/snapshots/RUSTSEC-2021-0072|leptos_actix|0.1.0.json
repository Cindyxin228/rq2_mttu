function to walk the Leptos router's app tree and produce a list of routes. Each integration has conversions to parse them into a format for either Actix or Axum, and then a trait to provide a `.leptos_routes()` extension for their respective routers.\r\n\r\nThis lets us avoid any wildcard routes for routing leptos! And allows you to define routes in only one place! We can do some server side error handling, and be a better neighbor for other services.\r\n\r\nI also put in the changes from #241 which are simplified by this change. Take a look and let me know if you spot any issues. The Actix version especially needs some prodding, it's got some fairly involved regexs, as its pathing is quite different from leptos_router.\r\n\r\nThe todo_app_sqlite and todo_app_sqlite_axum extensions have been updated to the new format. I'll update the rest if it looks good. @gbj and @akesson does that look right?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/269/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

I have made several changes to leptos to support the cargo-leptos beta.\r\n\r\nI hope both of you can take some time to review this, especially @akesson since it needs to work with cargo-leptos. I think I have it working with my stack, but would love your input.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Add id prop to `<Stylesheet/>` component to allow cargo-leptos' new css feature to work\r\n- Rename RenderOptions to LeptosOptions and delete KDL file writing\r\n- Read LeptosOptions from Cargo.toml in the [package.metadata.leptos] section, sharing keys with cargo-leptos\r\n- Conditional WASM filename based on PACKAGE_NAME env var. If deploying a bundle built with cargo-leptos, PACKAGE_NAME env var will need to manually set\r\n- Allowed Server Functions to set status of form redirects\r\n\r\nThis should allow for one source of truth for people using cargo-leptos or wasm-pack, and streamline some things.\r\n\r\nIt appears that cargo-leptos beta also does not support workspaces, as a bunch of paths are relative to the cargo root, which changes to the workspace root when in a workspace. This will prevent modifying the examples in leptos(and having them run with cargo-leptos watch), at least with the present example format. It shouldn't deter operation with wasm-pack", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/177/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,
