While I was doing this I've additionally added a new\r\n`--preview2` argument to enable using the new experimental\r\nimplementation of preview1 based on preview2 type/structs. This is\r\noff-by-default but is expected to become the default in the future.\r\n\r\nSome notable features of this change are:\r\n\r\n* The preview1-implemented-with-preview2 module now sports\r\n  `add_to_linker_{async,sync}` to replace the previous `add_to_linker`\r\n  which always did async.\r\n\r\n* Some trait bounds in the preview1-implemented-with-preview2 module are\r\n  simplified.\r\n\r\n* Some minor changes were made to `wiggle`'s macros to support a \"block\r\n  on\" that isn't the default wiggle dummy executor (as now we actually\r\n  do need Tokio)\r\n\r\n* Many options related to core wasm `Linker` configuration, such as\r\n  `--default-values-unknown-imports`, are not implemented for components\r\n  at this time. When used with components these options return an error.\r\n\r\n* Construction of WASI contexts has been refactored to pass around fewer\r\n  arguments to avoid threading through lots of values for both preview1\r\n  and preview2.\r\n\r\n* Reading the input to the Wasmtime CLI has been updated to read the\r\n  input in the `run` subcommand before handing it off to the `wasmtime`\r\n  crate's API to enable the CLI to use the contents of what's loaded to\r\n  determine what to do next.\r\n\r\n* Our generic `./ci/run-tests.sh` script has been updated to pass the\r\n  `--features component-model` flag to ensure that this CLI support is\r\n  tested during the normal test suite.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n---\r\n\r\n> ~~Procedural Note: this PR is based on https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6833 and https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6823 so the first few commits can be ignored.~~", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6836/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6836/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6831", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6831/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6831/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6831/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6831", "id": 1845640106, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBhDaXM5Xqesz", "number": 6831, "title": "Fix testing cli-flags crate with component-model feature", "user": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-08-10T17:56:18Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-10T19:10:26Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-10T19:04:35Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pulls/6831", "html_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6831", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6831.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6831.patch", "merged_at": "2023-08-10T19:04:35Z"}, "body": "Not used on CI yet but it's part of an upcoming change I figured I'd split out.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure you include the following information:\r\n\r\n- If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that\r\n  conversation.

This removes Wasmtime's implementation of the wasi-crypto proposal from in-tree along with its various support in CI, configuration, etc. See the discussion on #6732 for the full information but at a high level the main reasons for removing the implementation at this time are:\r\n\r\n* There is not currently an active maintainer of the Wasmtime integration here for wasi-crypto.\r\n* There are known issues with the code quality of the implementation such as transmutes of guest-owned memory to `&'static mut [u8]` and known unsafety in dependencies.\r\n* The size and breadth of the dependency tree brings maintenance burden and overhead to managing Wasmtime's dependency tree.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on the issue this commit does not mean that Wasmtime doesn't want to implement the wasi-crypto proposal. Instead the \"tier 3\" status of wasi-crypto needs to be re-attained to be included back in-tree, which would mean resolving the above issues.\r\n\r\nNote that this commit is intentionally just after the 13.0.0 branch point which means that this is slated for Wasmtime 14 to be released on September 20.\r\n\r\nCloses #6732\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure you include the following information:\r\n\r\n- If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that\r\n  conversation.
