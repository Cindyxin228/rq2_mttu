This also includes rewriting the inner literal extractor. The new extractor can now pluck literals out of more complex regexes such as `\\s+(Sherlock|[A-Z]atso[a-z]|Moriarty)\\s+`. The current version of ripgrep doesn't do any literal optimizations for that regex in particular.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this PR actually marks the end of ripgrep depending on `regex` directly for its primary search work load. It now depends on `regex-automata` directly, which exposes a more expressive API. For example, it lets one build regexes directly from `Hir`, which is quite useful in ripgrep's case because of the transformations it does on `Hir`. Previously, we had to roundtrip `Hir` back to the concrete syntax in order to turn it into a `regex::Regex`, since the `regex` crate very intentionally has no public dependency on `regex-syntax`. But `regex-automata`, as a more internal library that can evolve more rapidly, does have a public dependency on `regex-syntax`.", "reactions": {"url":
