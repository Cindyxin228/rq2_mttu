Migrating to clap 4.x fixes this, so we can re-enable clippy in CI.\r\n\r\nclap 4.x has a few API changes, the main one for us was that it now the original struct field name as a field ID, rather than the \"normalised\" form (changing `_` to `-`), so `conflicts_with_all` and `ArgGroup`s need updating.  It also looks like some parts of clap only check argument definitions at runtime, and errors don't show up with `cargo test`; so we need to run those binaries manually with `--help` to discover errors.\r\n\r\nWhile here, I've done some house-keeping on many `webauthn-authenticator-rs` examples:\r\n\r\n* rename `authenticate/main.rs` to `authenticate.rs`\r\n* rename `cable_domain/main.rs` to `cable_domain.rs`\r\n* `cable_tunnel` example now uses `required-features` in `Cargo.toml`; so `cable_tunnel/main.rs` is gone, and effectively renaming `cable_tunnel/core.rs` to `cable_tunnel.rs`. This also fixes a broken link in the `cable-tunnel-server` README.\r\n* delete obsolete `nfc_token_info` example, as `fido-key-manager` can do the same thing\r\n* rename `softtoken/main.rs` to `softtoken.rs`\r\n\r\nFixes #313\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

this][4] is a little long, and has a few different issues, but the one that hits us here is that deriving `Default` on an `enum` with a generic type parameter forces `T: Default` regardless of whether that type used in the default case.\r\n\r\nAs a simplified example, `Foo<T>` implements something similar to `Option<T>`, and tries to derive `Default`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Default)]\r\nenum Foo<T> {\r\n    #[default]\r\n    None,\r\n    Some(T),\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nstruct Bar {\r\n    v: u8,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let a: Foo<Bar> = Default::default();\r\n    let b = Foo::Some(Bar { v: 1 });\r\n    \r\n    println!(\"{a:?}, {b:?}\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiling that with `rustc >= 1.62.0, <= 1.65.0` results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `Bar: Default` is not satisfied\r\n  --> ./defaults.rs:14:23\r\n   |\r\n14 |     let a: Foo<Bar> = Default::default();\r\n   |

additional warning that deriving `Default` for enums is experimental.\r\n\r\nIt compiles fine with `rustc >= 1.66.0`, so I've set the MSRV explicitly for `webauthn-rs-proto`. It's not clear which PR actually fixed this for `rustc`, and [the bug is still open][4]. \ud83e\udd37 \r\n\r\n`kanidm` already needs Rust 1.66.0.\r\n\r\nThe other packages can have their MSRV updated as things go.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vyx4oj/actionsrs_organization_became_unmaintained/ig54zv7/\r\n[1]: https://crates.io/crates/axum/0.6.1#user-content-minimum-supported-rust-version\r\n[2]: https://github.com/micolous/webauthn-rs/actions/runs/4684510868/jobs/8300730956\r\n[3]: https://github.com/micolous/webauthn-rs/actions/runs/4684549653/jobs/8300810953\r\n[4]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26925\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n- [ ] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [ ] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/301/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/301/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300", "id": 1663791658, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85OF-1s", "number": 300, "title": "Fix broken deviceplug commit due to force-push of dev branch", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-12T05:09:49Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:37Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:36Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/300", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:36Z"}, "body": "We were pinning a commit of `deviceplug` for a Linux-specific bug fix;

Changes\r\n\r\nRelated fixing (which blocked this change):\r\n\r\n* only run `doctest` for features that are enabled\r\n\r\nPublic API changes:\r\n\r\n* `share_cable_authenticator()`'s parameters changed:\r\n  * added `options: ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions` parameter\r\n  * `tunnel_server_id` argument moved to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n  * `close_after_one_command` argument inverted to `stay_open_after_one_command`, and moved to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n  * added `tunnel_uri` field to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n\r\n* Added `connect_cable_authenticator_with_tunnel_uri` method for new feature.\r\n\r\n  This will probably be changed to use a `ConnectCableAuthenticatorOptions` struct like `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions` once there's something else to put in there.\r\n\r\nInternal API changes:\r\n\r\n* `Eid::get_domain` replaced with `Eid::get_domain_builder`\r\n* `Eid::get_connect_uri` now (internally) public\r\n* Added `Eid::build_connect_uri` (internally public)\r\n* Added `Discovery::build_new_tunnel_uri` (internally public)\r\n* `Discovery::get_connect_uri` removed (use `Eid::get_connect_uri` instead)\r\n* Added `uri` parameter to `Tunnel::connect_authenticator`\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n",

[x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\nRather than just adding the `.html` and `.js` files to a new folder under _webauthn-rs/tutorial/frontend/javascript_, I've added 2 features (`wasm` and `javascript`) to the Axum example so it's easier to use either front-end. `wasm` is marked as a default feature. These features are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\naxum-extra is added as a dependency so the [SpaRouter](https://docs.rs/axum-extra/latest/axum_extra/routing/struct.SpaRouter.html) can be used. This also allowed me to simplify some of the code (e.g. remove `file.rs`).\r\n\r\nThe index_view() HTML has been moved into assets/wasm_index.html and I changed `/pkg/wasm_bg.wasm` to `/assets/wasm_bg.wasm` etc.\r\nThe rationale for this was I felt pkg doesn't really apply to HTML/Javascript, and I wanted to keep the directory names consistent. Feel free to revert this though.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/258/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":

It's also best to do this on a separate device from the initiator, because it'll conflict with the initiator's local device access unless you're using `SoftToken`.\r\n\r\nThis works for me as an initiator with Android and iOS 16 authenticators, and as an authenticator with Chrome and Safari initiators (using Google's tunnel server).\r\n\r\nDeferred work listed in #259.\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo fmt has been run\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary><strong>In-development screenshots</strong></summary>\r\n  \r\n  ### MakeCredential flow on iOS 16:\r\n  \r\n  ![MakeCredential QR scanning on iOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/246847/208235351-c4fad1e7-6f51-4e4a-910d-c0e2717fbd97.png)\r\n  \r\n  ![MakeCredential TouchID prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/246847/208235357-86126f3b-3a69-413c-9dda-14d85620140b.png)\r\n  \r\n  ### GetAssertion flow on iOS 16:\r\n  \r\n  ![GetAssertion QR scanning on iOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/246847/208235360-3cdd8b08-b4a3-48f5-98df-7d540ae47598.png)\r\n  \r\n  ![GetAssertion TouchID prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/246847/208235363-30840112-f993-438b-99a8-fd32b6fd5e72.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/232/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/232/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/227", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/227/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/227/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/227/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/227", "id": 1450846072, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85C-__8", "number": 227, "title": "20221116 missing icon", "user": {"login": "Firstyear", "id": 271005, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271005?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear", "html_url": "https://github.com/Firstyear", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-11-16T04:43:46Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-16T09:26:34Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-16T09:26:31Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/227", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/227", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/227.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/227.patch", "merged_at": "2022-11-16T09:26:31Z"}, "body": "Fixes missing icon support.

I think I will also improve the Attestation CA and Attestation CA List code into proper builder patterns to assist with this. \r\n\r\n- [ x ] cargo fmt has been run\r\n- [ x ] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [ x ] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/217/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/217/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/215", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/215/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/215/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/215/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/215", "id": 1404125222, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85AizqH", "number": 215, "title": "Transport/Token AuthenticatorBackend for CTAP 2.0/2.1", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1314157583, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzE0MTU3NTgz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}, {"id": 5111725053, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCsX6y88AAAABMK67_Q", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/labels/ctap2", "name": "ctap2", "color": "FBCA04", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to the CtapAuthenticator backend"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2022-10-11T07:17:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-03T10:46:08Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-25T02:45:06Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/215", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/215", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/215.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/215.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-25T02:45:06Z"}, "body": "Targeting FIDOv2 tokens.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to build base functionality, similar to the existing Windows support in #204; but it will require implementing a bunch of other \"support things\" like PIN management and fingerprint support.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR adds:\r\n\r\n* Adds a `AuthenticatorBackend` ontop of `Transport` / `Token`. This supports core FIDO 2.0 and 2.1 functionality, with some exceptions\r\n* Refactors `Transport` to be `async`\r\n* Adds `UiCallback` to provide a UI for things the library needs\r\n* Adds `key_manager` example, which can use new library features\r\n* Pretty much rewrites all the existing CTAP 2.0 code (that was broken)\r\n* Make CTAP, NFC and USB-layer errors a first class error type\r\n* Removes `hack_make_cred` (we can do it for reals now)\r\n* Fixes support for USB HID tokens on Linux\r\n* Gates raw NFC access behind `nfc_raw_transmit` feature (needed for conformance example)\r\n\r\nCurrent TODO list (which will change):\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix CBOR serialisation bugs\r\n- [x] Propagate CTAP errors across transports\r\n- [x] Selection (CTAP v2.1 only; this doesn't handle the broader issue of handling multiple tokens, it's complex so I'm dropping that for now)\r\n  - [x] authenticatorSelection Request\r\n  - [x] authenticatorSelection Response\r\n  - [x] selecting a token based on authenticatorSelection (only CTAPv2.1)\r\n- [x] MakeCredential / Registration\r\n  - [x] Request\r\n  - [x] Response\r\n  - [x] Convert CTAP style CBOR response into WebAuthn style CBOR response\r\n  - [x] Fix the tests\r\n- [x] GetAssertion / Authenticate\r\n  - [x] Request\r\n  - [x] Response\r\n- [x] ClientPin\r\n  - [x] Auth tokens\r\n    - [x] No PIN/UV authorization\r\n    - [x] PIN with `getPinToken`\r\n    - [x] PIN with `getPinUvAuthTokenUsingPinWithPermissions`\r\n    - [x] UV with `getPinUvAuthTokenUsingUvWithPermissions`\r\n  - [x] PIN handshake protocols\r\n    - [x] Protocol 1\r\n    - [x] Protocol 2\r\n    - [x] Select best protocol automatically\r\n  - [x] PIN UI trait\r\n    - [x] PIN UI for CLI usage\r\n  - [x] PIN management\r\n    - [x] Set a new PIN\r\n    - [x] Change an existing PIN\r\n- [x] BioEnrollment\r\n  - [x] Get bio modality\r\n  - [x] Get fingerprint sensor info\r\n  - [x] Enroll a fingerprint\r\n  - [x] Enumerate enrolments\r\n  - [x] Set friendly name\r\n  - [x] Remove enrolment\r\n- [x] Authenticator configuration (subset)\r\n  - [x] Always require user verification\r\n  - [x] Minimum PIN length\r\n- [x] Factory reset (`authenticatorReset`)\r\n- [x] Split this PR up a bit where reasonable:\r\n  - [x] #225 \r\n  - [x] #226 \r\n\r\nPlatform tests needed:\r\n\r\n- [x] Linux\r\n- [x] macOS\r\n- [ ] Windows, as Administrator\r\n\r\nTransport tests needed:\r\n\r\n- [ ] NFC\r\n- [ ] USB HID\r\n\r\nThings that will be considered **out of scope** for this PR, and are to be addressed later for #214 :\r\n\r\n* CTAP v1 / U2F, including automatic fall-back\r\n* CTAP v2.1-pre fall-back\r\n* discoverable credentials (`authenticatorCredentialManagement`)\r\n* large blobs (`authenticatorLargeBlobs`)\r\n* enterprise attestation\r\n* Bluetooth Low Energy authenticators\r\n* MakeCredential / GetAssertion extensions\r\n* cancellations\r\n* Handling selection for multiple authenticators. `authenticatorSelection` only works in CTAP 2.1, so need something else:\r\n  - come up with another strategy for MakeCredential/GetAssertion with multiple tokens\r\n  - Handle user interaction with a selected token\r\n  - handle multiple PC/SC readers\r\n  - handle composite PC/SC devices (eg: ACR 123U)\r\n  - handle connecting or disconnecting an authenticator _while_ a prompt is in progress\r\n  - handle connecting or disconnecting a PC/SC reader _while_ a prompt is in progress\r\n  - handle when there are no tokens connected (ie: `wait_for_token`)\r\n* improved session handling (find a nice place to stash `pin_uv_auth_token` and `iface`)\r\n* PIN / UV retry limits\r\n\r\n#214 \r\n\r\n- [x] cargo fmt has been run\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been
