No new versions of the crate are available or the advisory has not been updated to denote the fix versions.\r\n1. No version of a crate has a published version which has semver compatibility with 1 or more of the versions that are required for the patch, recursively. This will by far be the most likely reason for a partial patch.\r\n1. The semver requirements for 1 or more crates is not compatible. This can be overridden via `--allow-incompatible`.\r\n\r\nThis is what a dry run currently looks like, displaying the patch that would be applied by the fix subcommand\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2316028/93370098-9a6b0b00-f850-11ea-9602-4890586cf8ef.png)\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adds support for `unsound` advisories\r\n1. Changes the logic introduced in #244 to support multiple advisory databases, we now use a single root directory (default: `~/.cargo/advisory-dbs`) under which each db is placed in a directory with canonicalized format, similar to how cargo places registry indexes\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\nNeed to fixup error reporting so that it's clear where and why an advisory can't be patched.\r\n\r\nResolves:
