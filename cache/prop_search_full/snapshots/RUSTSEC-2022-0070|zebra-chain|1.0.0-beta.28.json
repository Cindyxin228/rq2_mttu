for the Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure the PRs with the new checkpoint hashes and missed dependencies are already merged.\r\n      (See the release ticket checklist for details)\r\n\r\n# Summarise Release Changes\r\n\r\nThese steps can be done a few days before the release, in the same PR:\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\n\r\n**Important**: Any merge into `main` deletes any edits to the draft changelog.\r\nOnce you are ready to tag a release, copy the draft changelog into `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n\r\nWe use [the Release Drafter workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) to automatically create a [draft changelog](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases). We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.\r\n\r\nTo create the final change log:\r\n- [x] Copy the **latest** draft changelog into `CHANGELOG.md` (there can be multiple draft releases)\r\n- [x] Delete any trivial changes\r\n    - [ ] Put the list of deleted changelog entries in a PR comment to make reviewing easier\r\n- [x] Combine duplicate changes\r\n- [x] Edit change descriptions so they will make sense to Zebra users\r\n- [x] Check the category for each change\r\n  - Prefer the \"Fix\" category if you're not sure\r\n\r\n## README\r\n\r\nREADME updates can be skipped for urgent releases.\r\n\r\nUpdate the README to:\r\n- [x] Remove any \"Known Issues\" that have been fixed since the last release.\r\n- [x] Update the \"Build and Run Instructions\" with any new dependencies.\r\n      Check for changes in the `Dockerfile` since the last tag: `git diff <previous-release-tag> docker/Dockerfile`.\r\n- [x] If Zebra has started using newer Rust language features or standard library APIs, update the known working Rust version in the README, book, and `Cargo.toml`s\r\n\r\nYou can use a command like:\r\n```sh\r\nfastmod --fixed-strings '1.58' '1.65'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Create the Release PR\r\n\r\n- [x] Push the updated changelog and README into a new branch\r\n      for example: `bump-v1.0.0` - this needs to be different to the tag name\r\n- [x] Create a release PR by adding `&template=release-checklist.md` to the comparing url ([Example](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/compare/bump-v1.0.0?expand=1&template=release-checklist.md)).\r\n- [x] Freeze the [`batched` queue](https://dashboard.mergify.com/github/ZcashFoundation/repo/zebra/queues) using Mergify.\r\n- [x] Mark all the release PRs as `Critical` priority, so they go in the `urgent` Mergify queue.\r\n- [x] Mark all non-release PRs with `do-not-merge`, because Mergify checks approved PRs against every commit, even when a queue is frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Update Versions and End of Support\r\n\r\n## Update Zebra Version\r\n\r\n### Choose a Release Level\r\n\r\nZebra follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Semantic versions look like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-TAG.PRE-RELEASE]\r\n\r\nChoose a release level for `zebrad`. Release levels are based on user-visible changes from the changelog:\r\n- Mainnet Network Upgrades are `major` releases\r\n- significant new features or behaviour changes; changes to RPCs, command-line, or configs; and deprecations or removals are `minor` releases\r\n- otherwise, it is a `patch` release\r\n\r\nZebra's Rust API doesn't have any support or stability guarantees, so we keep all the `zebra-*` and `tower-*` crates on a beta `pre-release` version.\r\n\r\n### Update Crate Versions\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>If you're publishing crates for the first time, click this triangle for extra steps</summary>\r\n\r\n- [ ] Install `cargo-release`: `cargo install cargo-release`\r\n- [ ] Make sure you are  an owner of the crate or [a member of the Zebra crates.io `owners` group on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ZcashFoundation/teams/owners)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nCheck that the release will work:\r\n- [x] Update crate versions, commit the changes to the release branch, and do a release dry-run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncargo release version --verbose --execute --allow-branch '*' --workspace --exclude zebrad beta\r\ncargo release version --verbose --execute --allow-branch '*' --package zebrad patch # [ major | minor | patch ]\r\ncargo release replace --verbose --execute --allow-branch '*' --package zebrad\r\ncargo release commit --verbose --execute --allow-branch '*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCrate publishing is [automatically checked in CI](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/release-crates-io.yml) using \"dry run\" mode.\r\n\r\n## Update End of Support\r\n\r\nThe end of support height is calculated from the current blockchain height:\r\n- [x] Find where the Zcash blockchain tip is now by using a [Zcash explorer](https://zcashblockexplorer.com/blocks) or other tool.\r\n- [x] Replace `ESTIMATED_RELEASE_HEIGHT` in [`end_of_support.rs`](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/zebrad/src/components/sync/end_of_support.rs) with the height you estimate the release will be tagged.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Optional: calculate the release tagging height</summary>\r\n\r\n- Add `1152` blocks for each day until the release\r\n- For example, if the release is in 3 days, add `1152 * 3` to the current Mainnet block height\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Update the Release PR\r\n\r\n- [x] Push the version increments and the release constants to the release branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Publish the Zebra Release\r\n\r\n## Create the GitHub Pre-Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Wait for all the release PRs to be merged\r\n- [x] Create a new release using the draft release as a base, by clicking the Edit icon in the [draft release](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases)\r\n- [x] Set the tag name to the version tag,\r\n      for example: `v1.0.0`\r\n- [x] Set the release to target the `main` branch\r\n- [x] Set the release title to `Zebra ` followed by the version tag,\r\n      for example: `Zebra 1.0.0`\r\n- [x] Replace the prepopulated draft changelog in the release description with the final changelog you created;\r\n      starting just _after_ the title `## [Zebra ...` of the current version being released,\r\n      and ending just _before_ the title of the previous release.\r\n- [x] Mark the release as 'pre-release', until it has been built and tested\r\n- [x] Publish the pre-release to GitHub using \"Publish Release\"\r\n- [x] Delete all the [draft releases from the list of releases](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases)\r\n\r\n## Test the Pre-Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Wait until the [Docker binaries have been built on `main`](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/continous-integration-docker.yml), and the quick tests have passed.\r\n- [x] Wait until the [pre-release deployment machines have successfully launched](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/continous-delivery.yml)\r\n\r\n## Publish Release\r\n\r\n- [x] [Publish the release to GitHub](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases) by disabling 'pre-release', then clicking \"Set as the latest release\"\r\n\r\n## Publish Crates\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `cargo login`\r\n- [x] Run `cargo clean` in the zebra repo (optional)\r\n- [x] Publish the crates to crates.io: `cargo release publish --verbose --workspace --execute`\r\n- [x] Check that Zebra can be installed from `crates.io`:\r\n      `cargo install --locked --force --version 1.minor.patch zebrad && ~/.cargo/bin/zebrad`\r\n      and put the output in a comment on the PR.\r\n\r\n## Publish Docker Images\r\n- [x] Wait for the [the Docker images to be published successfully](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/release-binaries.yml).\r\n- [x] Un-freeze the [`batched` queue](https://dashboard.mergify.com/github/ZcashFoundation/repo/zebra/queues) using Mergify.\r\n- [x] Remove `do-not-merge` from the PRs you added it to\r\n\r\n## Release Failures\r\n\r\nIf building or running fails after tagging:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Tag a new release, following these instructions...</summary>\r\n\r\n1.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWe want to stop Zebra panicking on shutdown.\r\n\r\nClose #7170\r\n\r\n### Specifications\r\n\r\nThreads:\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.is_finished\r\n\r\nAsync tasks:\r\nhttps://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.JoinHandle.html#impl-Future-for-JoinHandle%3CT%3E\r\nhttps://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.JoinError.html#method.try_into_panic\r\n\r\n### Complex Code or Requirements\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces a bunch of complex panic-handling code with consistent trait methods.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Create generic traits for checking and waiting for panics\r\n- Implement those traits on OS threads and async tasks\r\n- Use those trait impls to fix the panic and cancel bugs\r\n- Replace existing manual implementations with the trait impls\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI've changed enough impls in this PR that any bugs should show up in the tests as they shut Zebra down.\r\n\r\n## Review\r\n\r\nThis is a routine bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Reviewer Checklist\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Will the PR name make sense to users?\r\n    - [ ] Does it need extra CHANGELOG info? (new features, breaking changes, large changes)\r\n  - [ ] Are the PR labels correct?\r\n  - [ ] Does the code do what the ticket and PR says?\r\n    - [ ] Does it change concurrent code, unsafe code, or consensus rules?\r\n  - [ ] How do you know it works? Does it have tests?\r\n\r\n## Follow Up Work\r\n\r\nWe can use these methods on `JoinError` and `JoinHandle` throughout Zebra, or maybe create our own `JoinHandle` and `JoinError` types that automatically use these methods.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7219/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7219/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7189", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7189/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7189/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7189/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/7189", "id": 1795807646, "node_id": "PR_kwDODDv0A85VCQrQ", "number": 7189, "title": "build(deps): bump regex from 1.8.4 to 1.9.1", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1649367342, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNjQ5MzY3MzQy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/labels/A-dependencies", "name": "A-dependencies", "color": "f9d0c4", "default": false, "description": "Area: Dependency file updates"}, {"id": 2061826443, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxODI2NDQz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/labels/A-rust", "name": "A-rust", "color": "fbca04", "default": false, "description": "Area: Updates to Rust code"}, {"id": 4559885395, "node_id": "LA_kwDODDv0A88AAAABD8pUUw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/labels/C-trivial", "name": "C-trivial", "color": "f5f1fd", "default": false, "description": "Category: A trivial change that is not worth mentioning in the CHANGELOG"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2023-07-10T02:37:39Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-12T21:30:37Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-12T21:30:36Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pulls/7189", "html_url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/7189", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/7189.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/7189.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-12T21:30:36Z"}, "body": "Depends-On: #7158\r\n\r\nBumps [regex](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex) from 1.8.4 to 1.9.1.\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\r\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">regex's changelog</a>.</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h1>1.9.1 (2023-07-07)</h1>\r\n<p>This is a patch release which fixes a memory usage regression. In the regex\r\n1.9 release, one of the internal engines used a more aggressive allocation\r\nstrategy than what was done previously. This patch release reverts to the\r\nprior on-demand strategy.</p>\r\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027\">#1027</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1027\">rust-lang/regex#1027</a>):\r\nChange the allocation strategy for the backtracker to be less aggressive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>1.9.0 (2023-07-05)</h1>\r\n<p>This release marks the end of a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656\">years long rewrite of the regex crate\r\ninternals</a>. Since this is\r\nsuch a big release, please report any issues or regressions you find. We would\r\nalso love to hear about improvements as well.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to many internal improvements that should hopefully result in\r\n&quot;my regex searches are faster,&quot; there have also been a few API additions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A new <code>Captures::extract</code> method for quickly accessing the substrings\r\nthat match each capture group in a regex.</li>\r\n<li>A new inline flag, <code>R</code>, which enables CRLF mode. This makes <code>.</code> match any\r\nUnicode scalar value except for <code>\\r</code> and <code>\\n</code>, and also makes <code>(?m:^)</code> and\r\n<code>(?m:$)</code> match after and before both <code>\\r</code> and <code>\\n</code>, respectively, but never\r\nbetween a <code>\\r</code> and <code>\\n</code>.</li>\r\n<li><code>RegexBuilder::line_terminator</code> was added to further customize the line\r\nterminator used by <code>(?m:^)</code> and <code>(?m:$)</code> to be any arbitrary byte.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>std</code> Cargo feature is now actually optional. That is, the <code>regex</code> crate\r\ncan be used without the standard library.</li>\r\n<li>Because <code>regex 1.9</code> may make binary size and compile times even worse, a\r\nnew experimental crate called <code>regex-lite</code> has been published. It prioritizes\r\nbinary size and compile times over functionality (like Unicode) and\r\nperformance. It shares no code with the <code>regex</code> crate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>New features:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[FEATURE <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/244\">#244</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/244\">rust-lang/regex#244</a>):\r\nOne can opt into CRLF mode via the <code>R</code> flag.\r\ne.g., <code>(?mR:$)</code> matches just before <code>\\r\\n</code>.</li>\r\n<li>[FEATURE <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/259\">#259</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/259\">rust-lang/regex#259</a>):\r\nMulti-pattern searches with offsets can be done with <code>regex-automata 0.3</code>.</li>\r\n<li>[FEATURE <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/476\">#476</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/476\">rust-lang/regex#476</a>):\r\n<code>std</code> is now an optional feature. <code>regex</code> may be used with only <code>alloc</code>.</li>\r\n<li>[FEATURE <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/644\">#644</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/644\">rust-lang/regex#644</a>):\r\n<code>RegexBuilder::line_terminator</code> configures how <code>(?m:^)</code> and <code>(?m:$)</code> behave.</li>\r\n<li>[FEATURE <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/675\">#675</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/675\">rust-lang/regex#675</a>):</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>...

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe script in our release checklist doesn't actually work.\r\n\r\n### Specifications\r\n\r\n`cargo release` command reference:\r\nhttps://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/blob/master/docs/reference.md\r\n\r\n### Complex Code or Requirements\r\n\r\nThis PR works around a `cargo publish` unpublished version resolution bug, by skipping the failing Zebra crates:\r\nhttps://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/issues/691\r\n\r\nThis bug only happens in dry runs, publishing crates works fine.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRelease Checklist Fixes:\r\n- Update the release script so it works\r\n    - Fix doc version replacements and add them to the script\r\n- Add and remove `do-not-merge` tags at the right times\r\n- Fix a command that's easy to accidentally run on the wrong version\r\n\r\nRelease Config Fixes:\r\n- Add a release config to simplify release commands and apply default new crate settings\r\n- Fix a release warning about an outdated default-features spelling\r\n- Remove a redundant elasticsearch feature dependency that caused release errors\r\n\r\nCI:\r\n- Check that the release script works by running it on each PR (but skip crates that fail dry run checks)\r\n- Add special arguments that are needed for non-interactive release dry runs\r\n\r\n### Release v1.0.1 Cleanups\r\n\r\n- Update release date\r\n- Add a missing changelog entry\r\n- Do missing doc version replacements\r\n\r\n### Admin Actions\r\n\r\n- [x] Admin: Add the new check as a branch protection rule\r\n\r\n## Review\r\n\r\nThis is a routine fix.\r\n\r\n### Reviewer Checklist\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Are the PR labels correct?\r\n  - [ ] Does the code do what the ticket and PR says?\r\n    - [ ] Does

Updates\r\n\r\n- [x] Add these new user-visible PRs to the changelog:\r\n  - #7045\r\n  - #7095\r\n  - #7102\r\n  - #7103 (release blocker)\r\n- [x] Check for other commits to main since `#7106` on 30 June: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/commits/main\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n  - [x] add entry for #7104 (in PR #7128)\r\n  - [x] add entry for #7094\r\n\r\n# Prepare for the Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure the PRs with the new checkpoint hashes ~~and missed dependencies~~ are already merged.\r\n      (See the release ticket checklist for details)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Summarise Release Changes\r\n\r\nThese steps can be done a few days before the release, in the same PR:\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\n\r\n**Important**: Any merge into `main` deletes any edits to the draft changelog.\r\nOnce you are ready to tag a release, copy the draft changelog into `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n\r\nWe use [the Release Drafter workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) to automatically create a [draft changelog](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases). We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.\r\n\r\nTo create the final change log:\r\n- [x] Copy the **latest** draft changelog into `CHANGELOG.md` (there can be multiple draft releases)\r\n- [x] Delete any trivial changes\r\n    - [x] Put the list of deleted changelog entries in a PR comment to make reviewing easier\r\n- [x] Combine duplicate changes\r\n- [x] Edit change descriptions so they will make sense to Zebra users\r\n- [x] Check the category for each change\r\n  - Prefer the \"Fix\" category if you're not sure\r\n\r\n## README\r\n\r\nREADME updates can be skipped for urgent releases.\r\n\r\nUpdate the README to:\r\n- [x] Remove any \"Known Issues\" that have been fixed since the last release.\r\n- [x] Update the \"Build and Run Instructions\" with any new dependencies.\r\n      Check for changes in the `Dockerfile` since the last tag: `git diff <previous-release-tag> docker/Dockerfile`.\r\n- [x] If Zebra has started using newer Rust language features or standard library APIs, update the known working Rust version in the README, book, and `Cargo.toml`s\r\n\r\nYou can use a command like:\r\n```sh\r\nfastmod --fixed-strings '1.58' '1.65'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Create the Release PR\r\n\r\n- [x] Push the updated changelog and README into a new branch\r\n      for example: `bump-v1.0.0` - this needs to be different to the tag name\r\n- [x] Create a release PR by adding `&template=release-checklist.md` to the comparing url ([Example](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/compare/bump-v1.0.0?expand=1&template=release-checklist.md)).\r\n- [x] Freeze the [`batched` queue](https://dashboard.mergify.com/github/ZcashFoundation/repo/zebra/queues) using Mergify.\r\n- [x] Mark all the release PRs as `Critical` priority, so they go in the `urgent` Mergify queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Update Versions and End of Support\r\n\r\n## Update Zebra Version\r\n\r\n### Choose a Release Level\r\n\r\nZebra follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Semantic versions look like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-TAG.PRE-RELEASE]\r\n\r\nChoose a release level for `zebrad`. Release levels are based on user-visible changes from the changelog:\r\n- Mainnet Network Upgrades are `major` releases\r\n- significant new features, large changes, deprecations, and removals are `minor` releases\r\n- otherwise, it is a `patch` release\r\n\r\nZebra's Rust API doesn't have any support or stability guarantees, so we keep all the `zebra-*` and `tower-*` crates on a beta `pre-release` version.\r\n\r\n### Update Crate Versions\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>If you're publishing crates for the first time:</summary>\r\n\r\n- [ ] Install `cargo-release`: `cargo install cargo-release`\r\n- [ ] Make sure you are  an owner of the crate or [a member of the Zebra crates.io `owners` group on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ZcashFoundation/teams/owners)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- [x] Update crate versions, commit the changes to the release branch, and do a release dry-run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncargo clean # optional\r\ncargo release version --verbose --execute --workspace --exclude zebrad beta\r\ncargo release version --verbose --execute --package zebrad patch # [ major | minor | patch ]\r\ncargo release commit --verbose --execute\r\n# TODO: fix missing dependency errors in cargo release, so we can do a dry run for all the crates \r\ncargo release publish --verbose --dry-run --workspace --exclude zebra-consensus --exclude zebra-rpc --exclude zebra-utils --exclude zebrad\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Update End of Support\r\n\r\nThe end of support height is calculated from the current blockchain height:\r\n- [x] Find where the Zcash blockchain tip is now by using a [Zcash explorer](https://zcashblockexplorer.com/blocks) or other tool.\r\n- [x] Replace `ESTIMATED_RELEASE_HEIGHT` in [`end_of_support.rs`](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/zebrad/src/components/sync/end_of_support.rs) with the height you estimate the release will be tagged.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Optional: calculate the release tagging height</summary>\r\n\r\n- Add `1152` blocks for each day until the release\r\n- For example, if the release is in 3 days, add `1152 * 3` to the current Mainnet block height\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Update the Release PR\r\n\r\n- [x] Push the version increments and the release constants to the release branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Publish the Zebra Release\r\n\r\n## Create the GitHub Pre-Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Wait for all the release PRs to be merged\r\n    - [x] #7103 (release blocker)\r\n    - [x] #7090 (release preparation)\r\n- [x] Create a new release using the draft release as a base, by clicking the Edit icon in the [draft release](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases)\r\n- [x] Set the tag name to the version tag,\r\n      for example: `v1.0.0`\r\n- [x] Set the release to target the `main` branch\r\n- [x] Set the release title to `Zebra ` followed by the version tag,\r\n      for example: `Zebra 1.0.0`\r\n- [x] Replace the prepopulated draft changelog in the release description with the final changelog you created;\r\n      starting just _after_ the title `## [Zebra ...` of the current version being released,\r\n      and ending just _before_ the title of the previous release.\r\n- [x] Mark the release as 'pre-release', until it has been built and tested\r\n- [x] Publish the pre-release to GitHub using \"Publish Release\"\r\n- [x] Delete all the [draft releases from the list of releases](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases)\r\n\r\n## Test the Pre-Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Wait until the [Docker binaries have been built on `main`](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/continous-integration-docker.yml), and the quick tests have passed.\r\n      (You can ignore the full sync and `lightwalletd` tests, because they take about a day to run.)\r\n- [x] Wait until the [pre-release deployment machines have successfully launched](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/continous-delivery.yml)\r\n\r\n## Publish Release\r\n\r\n- [x] [Publish the release to GitHub](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases) by disabling 'pre-release', then clicking \"Set as the latest release\"\r\n\r\n## Publish Crates\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `cargo login`\r\n- [ ] Run `cargo clean` in the zebra repo (optional)\r\n- [x] Publish the crates to crates.io: `cargo release publish --verbose --workspace --execute`\r\n- [x] Check that Zebra can be installed from `crates.io`:\r\n      `cargo install --locked --force --version 1.0.1 zebrad && ~/.cargo/bin/zebrad`\r\n      and put the output in a comment on the PR.\r\n\r\n## Publish Docker Images\r\n- [x] Wait for the [the Docker images to be published successfully](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/release-binaries.yml).\r\n- [x] Un-freeze the [`batched` queue](https://dashboard.mergify.com/github/ZcashFoundation/repo/zebra/queues) using Mergify.\r\n\r\n## Release Failures\r\n\r\nIf building or running fails after tagging:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Tag a new release, following these instructions...</summary>\r\n\r\n1.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWe're changing our database note commitment tree format code in PR #7053, but we don't have good coverage for sprout trees.

Motivation\r\n\r\nOpenSSL continues to have memory safety vulnerabilities:\r\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xcf7-rvmh-g6q4\r\n\r\n`zebrad` isn't impacted by this one in production, because openssl is only a dependency of our tests and experimental features. But it could accidentally become a production dependency when we stabilise features or add new dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions ternary expressions:\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#example\r\n\r\n### Complex Code or Requirements\r\n\r\n`--all-features` activates the openssl dependency, because it's an optional dependency of some of Zebra's dependencies. So I changed the CI check to ignore banned crates for `--all-features`. (And ignore missing dependencies for default features.)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Ban `openssl` as a Zebra dependency\r\n- Make CI check that openssl is not used in default production builds and production Docker images\r\n\r\nRelated fixes:\r\n- Add a `default-release-binaries` feature to `zebrad` and use it in Docker files and production/prod test workflows\r\n- Ignore expected warnings for default features and `default-release-binaries`\r\n- Ban wildcard (\"any version\") dependencies, except in tests\r\n\r\n## Review\r\n\r\nThis is a low priority security fix.\r\n\r\n### Reviewer Checklist\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Will the PR name make sense to users?\r\n    - [ ] Does it need extra CHANGELOG info?
