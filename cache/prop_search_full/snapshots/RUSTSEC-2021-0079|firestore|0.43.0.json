aims to implement a feature found in Firestore implementations for other languages, such as [Go](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/feb6b0a8b771875a55c75fa959e19f6f12079030/firestore/transaction.go#LL93C41-L93C41) and [Typescript](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-firestore/blob/d6d44e1e58b379f33f893fa6b151abfe1352b9b3/dev/src/transaction.ts#LL470C9-L470C23).\r\n\r\nThese \"run transaction\" functions allow the user to pass in a closure that performs reads and/or writes and attempts to commit a transaction with a limited number of retries. Many of the details are not exposed to the user.\r\n\r\nI've introduced an example that uses `run_transaction` to increment a counter concurrently using `FuturesOrdered`.\r\n\r\n# Potential Problems\r\n- ~I've introduced the [backoff](https://crates.io/crates/backoff) crate into the Cargo.toml. If this is not desirable, we can rework the retry mechanism such that it does not bring in a dependency.~\r\n- Users' closures must be wrapped in `Box::pin` presently. Is it possible to push this into the `run_transaction` function itself?\r\n- ~I've placed the implementation directly into `FirestoreDb`. This seems okay, but is it the correct place for it?~\r\n- `run_transaction` will always use `ReadWrite` for the consistency selector. Shouldn't we handle `ReadOnly` transactions as well?\r\n- We should expose some options about the transaction behavior to the user, as the SDKs in other languages do. This includes retry configuration, a manual specification of the transaction read time, and whether or not the transaction should be read-only (which perhaps solves the previous potential issue)\r\n- ~All reads must take place before any writes in the transaction, but I haven't tested to verify that we gracefully handle that error.~", "reactions": {"url":
