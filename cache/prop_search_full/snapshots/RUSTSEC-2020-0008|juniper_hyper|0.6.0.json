This can be reviewed separately, or that PR can be closed and everything can just be reviewed at once.~ (Edit: This was merged separately.)\r\n* Errors are now correctly emitted for field resolution errors within subscription event streams. Previously they were just being silently dropped inside of `juniper_subscriptions::whole_responses_stream`. This and the first bullet are the only changes outside of the new crate, `juniper_warp::subscriptions` mod, and the `warp_subscriptions` example.\r\n* Types for all graphql-ws message types have been added. This makes a host of things much easier than before, and makes serialization and deserialization much safer and more robust. For example, previously, if a client sent a \"}\" in a message id, we would do bad things because the implementation was crafting responses using `format!`.\r\n* The server now responds to \"connection_init\" with the appropriate \"ack\" + \"keep-alive\".\r\n* The server now sends keep-alives. These default to a 30 second interval, but are configurable.\r\n* Queries and mutations can now be executed over the same WebSocket connection.\r\n* Stopping a subscription now has well-defined timing. All work is immediately dropped and the \"complete\" message is not sent until we can guarantee that no other events will be sent.\r\n* We now have more reasonable behavior for \"weird things\" such as clients using the same id for multiple subscriptions, not sending \"init\" packets, etc. Clients *must* send an \"init\" packet before anything else happens, and multiple subscriptions with the same id do not start multiple unstoppable background streams.\r\n* We now correctly send \"error\" messages for pre-execution errors and \"data\" packets for errors that happen during execution.\r\n* We now correctly send \"connection_error\" messages for issues not associated with operations such as malformed client messages.\r\n* There is now a configurable maximum number of operations a single connection can have at any time.\r\n* Parameters from the client's \"connection_init\" message are now parsed and can be used as parameters for context creation. Because we actually require the \"connection_init\" message now, no context is required until this point. This enables support for authentication via this message.\r\n* Serialization and deserialization are defined outside of the crate, so users can serialize in the way that's most optimal for them. You don't even have to use JSON.\r\n* There are now unit tests, and lots of them. Because the entire implementation is contained by a single `Sink + Stream` and there are proper message types, writing unit tests is a breeze.\r\n\r\nI suspect there are more. The previous implementation was really rough. But on to the usage.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nI'm just going to copy a unit test:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[tokio::test]\r\nasync fn test_query() {\r\n    let mut conn = Connection::new(\r\n        new_test_schema(),\r\n        ConnectionConfig::new(Context(1)).with_keep_alive_interval(Duration::from_secs(0)),\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    conn.send(ClientMessage::ConnectionInit {\r\n        payload: Variables::default(),\r\n    })\r\n    .await\r\n    .unwrap();\r\n\r\n    assert_eq!(ServerMessage::ConnectionAck, conn.next().await.unwrap());\r\n\r\n    conn.send(ClientMessage::Start {\r\n        id: \"foo\".to_string(),\r\n        payload: StartPayload {\r\n            query: \"{context}\".to_string(),\r\n            variables: Variables::default(),\r\n            operation_name: None,\r\n        },\r\n    })\r\n    .await\r\n    .unwrap();\r\n\r\n    assert_eq!(\r\n        ServerMessage::Data {\r\n            id: \"foo\".to_string(),\r\n            payload: DataPayload {\r\n                data: Value::Object(\r\n                    [(\"context\", Value::Scalar(DefaultScalarValue::Int(1)))]\r\n                        .iter()\r\n                        .cloned()\r\n                        .collect()\r\n                ),\r\n                errors: vec![],\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        conn.next().await.unwrap()\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    assert_eq!(\r\n        ServerMessage::Complete {\r\n            id: \"foo\".to_string(),\r\n        },\r\n        conn.next().await.unwrap()\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt couldn't really be any easier.\r\n\r\nThe second argument to `Connection::new` is generic. Instead of `ConnectionConfig`, you can provide a closure:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut conn = Connection::new(new_test_schema(), |params: Variables| async move {\r\n    Ok(ConnectionConfig::new(Context(1))) as Result<_, Infallible>\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows you to defer the configuration until you receive the \"connection_init\" parameters. Any error returned by this closure is sent back the client.\r\n\r\nThe entire `juniper_warp::subscriptions` module is now just a few lines to compose the sinks and streams:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// Serves the graphql-ws protocol over a WebSocket connection.\r\n///\r\n/// The `init` argument is used to provide the context and additional configuration for\r\n/// connections. This can be a `juniper_graphql_ws::ConnectionConfig` if the context and\r\n/// configuration are already known, or it can be a closure that gets executed asynchronously\r\n/// when the client sends the ConnectionInit message. Using a closure allows you to perform\r\n/// authentication based on the parameters provided by the client.\r\npub async fn serve_graphql_ws<Query, Mutation, Subscription, CtxT, S, I>(\r\n    websocket: warp::ws::WebSocket,\r\n    root_node: Arc<RootNode<'static, Query, Mutation, Subscription, S>>,\r\n    init: I,\r\n) -> Result<(), Error>\r\nwhere\r\n    Query: GraphQLTypeAsync<S, Context = CtxT> + Send + 'static,\r\n    Query::TypeInfo: Send + Sync,\r\n    Mutation: GraphQLTypeAsync<S, Context = CtxT> + Send + 'static,\r\n    Mutation::TypeInfo: Send + Sync,\r\n    Subscription: GraphQLSubscriptionType<S, Context = CtxT> + Send + 'static,\r\n    Subscription::TypeInfo: Send + Sync,\r\n    CtxT: Unpin + Send + Sync + 'static,\r\n    S: ScalarValue + Send + Sync + 'static,\r\n    I: Init<S, CtxT> + Send,\r\n{\r\n    let (ws_tx, ws_rx) = websocket.split();\r\n    let (s_tx, s_rx) = Connection::new(ArcSchema(root_node), init).split();\r\n\r\n    let ws_rx = ws_rx.map(|r| r.map(|msg| Message(msg)));\r\n    let s_rx = s_rx.map(|msg| {\r\n        serde_json::to_string(&msg)\r\n            .map(|t| warp::ws::Message::text(t))\r\n            .map_err(|e| Error::Serde(e))\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    match future::select(\r\n        ws_rx.forward(s_tx.sink_err_into()),\r\n        s_rx.forward(ws_tx.sink_err_into()),\r\n    )\r\n    .await\r\n    {\r\n        Either::Left((r, _)) => r.map_err(|e| e.into()),\r\n        Either::Right((r, _)) => r,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo adding support for the other frameworks should be pretty trivial now and they can all share one implementation.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n* Depends on / includes https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/719\r\n* Obsoletes https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/717\r\n* Obsoletes https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/617\r\n* Obsoletes https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/597\r\n* Simplifies https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/716\r\n* Simplifies https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/649\r\n\r\n* Closes #709", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/721/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/721/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/716", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/716/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/716/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/716/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/716", "id": 664089861, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDU1Mzg4MTk0", "number": 716, "title": "Impl subscriptions for juniper_actix", "user": {"login": "mihai-dinculescu", "id": 9944681, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDQ2ODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9944681?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu", "html_url": "https://github.com/mihai-dinculescu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mihai-dinculescu/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2020-07-22T22:32:47Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-10T13:18:54Z", "closed_at": "2020-08-09T22:19:35Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-rust/juniper/pulls/716", "html_url": "https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/716", "diff_url": "https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/716.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/716.patch", "merged_at": "2020-08-09T22:19:35Z"}, "body": "Baisc implementation of #649.\r\n\r\nI have migrated to juniper_graphql_ws, and interacting with it has been a breeze.\r\n\r\nactix-web is not exposing a standard websocket, so we still have to use their ws actor.

to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">criterion's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[0.3.3] - 2020-06-29</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>CRITERION_HOME</code> environment variable to set the directory for Criterion to store\nits results and charts in.</li>\n<li>Added support for <a href=\"https://github.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion\">cargo-criterion</a>. The long-term\ngoal here is to remove code from Criterion-rs itself to improve compile times, as well as to add\nfeatures to <code>cargo-criterion</code> that are difficult to implement in Criterion-rs.</li>\n<li>Add sampling mode option for benchmarks. This allows the user to change how Criterion.rs chooses\nthe iteration counts in each sample. By default, nothing will change for most benchmarks, but\nvery slow benchmarks will now run fewer iterations to fit in the desired number of samples.\nThis affects the statistics and plots generated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The serialization format for some of the files has changed. This may cause your first benchmark\nrun after updating to produce errors, but they're harmless and will go away after running the\nbenchmarks once.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the current measurement was not shown on the relative regression plot.</li>\n<li>Fixed rare panic in the plotters backend.</li>\n<li>Panic with a clear error message (rather than panicking messily later on) when the user sets the\ngroup or function name to the empty string.</li>\n<li>Escape single quotes in benchmark names when generating Gnuplot scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.3.2] - 2020-04-26</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>?Sized</code> bound to benchmark parameter types, which allows dynamically sized types like\n<code>&amp;str</code> and <code>&amp;[T]</code> to be used as benchmark parameters.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>--output-format &lt;format&gt;</code> command-line option.

not so great? \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe want GraphQL interfaces which _just feel right like usual ones_ in many PLs.\r\n\r\n~~They should be able to work with an open set of types _without_ requiring a user to specify all the concrete types an interface can downcasts into _on the interface side_.~~  \r\nWe're [unable](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/682#issuecomment-644771600) to do that, at the moment \ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\nBut we still could have a nice proc macros as convenient as they can be \ud83d\ude43\r\n\r\n\r\n## New design\r\n\r\n### Traits\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[graphql_interface(enum = CharacterValue)]  // <-- use enum for dispatching\r\n#[graphql_interface(for = [Human, Droid, Jedi])]  // <-- mandatory =( and should enumerate all implementors\r\n#[graphql_interface(name = \"Character\", desc = \"Traited character\")]\r\n#[graphql_interface(context = MyContext)]  // <-- if not specified, then auto-inferred from methods, if possible, otherwise is `()`\r\n#[graphql_interface(scalar = juniper::DefaultScalarValue)] // <-- if not specified, then generated code is parametrized by `__S: ScalarValue`\r\n#[graphql_interface(on Jedi = custom_downcast_as_jedi)]  // <-- custom external downcaster\r\ntrait Character {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str;\r\n\r\n    // Optional custom downcaster.\r\n    #[graphql_interface(downcast)]\r\n    fn as_droid(&self) -> Option<&Droid> { None }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[graphql_interface(dyn = DynCharacter2, for = Human)]  // use trait object for dispatching\r\ntrait Character2 {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(GraphQLObject)]\r\n#[graphql(implements = [CharacterValue, DynCharacter2], Context = MyContext)]\r\nstruct Human {\r\n    id: String,\r\n    home_planet: String,\r\n}\r\n#[graphql_interface]\r\nimpl Character for Human {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str {\r\n        &self.id\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n#[graphql_interface(dyn)]  // <-- this `dyn` is inevitable when dispatching via trait objects =(\r\nimpl Character2 for Human {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str {\r\n        &self.id\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(GraphQLObject)]\r\n#[graphql(implements = CharacterValue, Context = MyContext)]\r\nstruct Droid {\r\n    id: String,\r\n    primary_function: String,\r\n}\r\n#[graphql_interface]\r\nimpl Character for Droid {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str {\r\n        &self.id\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn as_droid(&self) -> Option<&Droid> {\r\n        Some(self)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#[derive(GraphQLObject)]\r\n#[graphql(implements = CharacterValue, Context = MyContext)]\r\nstruct Jedi {\r\n    id: String,\r\n    rank: String,\r\n}\r\n#[graphql_interface]\r\nimpl Character for Jedi {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str {\r\n        &self.id\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nfn custom_downcast_as_jedi(ch: &CharacterValue, ctx: &MyContext) -> Option<&Jedi> {\r\n     ctx.can_i_haz_the_jedi_please(ch)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe nearest analogue of GraphQL interfaces are, definitely, traits. However, they are a little different beasts than may seem at first glance. The main difference goes that in GraphQL interface type serves _both_ as an _abstraction_ and a _value dispatching to concrete implementers_, while in Rust, a trait is an _abstraction only_ and you need a _separate type to dispatch to a concrete implemeter_, like enum or trait object, because trait is not even a type itself. This difference imposes a lot of unobvious corner cases when we try to express GraphQL interfaces in Rust. This PR tries to implement a reasonable middleground.\r\n\r\nSo, poking with GraphQL interfaces will require two parts:\r\n- declare the _abstraction_;\r\n- operate ingerface's _values_.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an _abstraction_ is almost as simple as declaring trait:\r\n```rust\r\n#[graphql_interface(enum = CharacterValue)]  // <-- specify type ident to represent value of interface\r\n#[graphql_interface(for = [Human, Droid, Jedi])]  // <-- specify implementers\r\ntrait Character {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, you need to operate in a code with a Rust implementing this GraphQL interface's value:\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(GraphQLObject)]\r\n#[graphql(implements = CharacterValue)]  // <-- we refer here to Rust type implementing GraphQL interface, not trait\r\nstruct Human {\r\n    id: String,\r\n}\r\n#[graphql_interface]\r\nimpl Character for Human {  <-- and here we're implementing GraphQL interface for Human Graphql object as a regulat trait impl\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str {\r\n        &self.id\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Trait objects\r\n\r\nBy default, an enum dispatch is used, because we should enumerate all the implementers anyway.\r\n\r\nHowever, a dyn dispatch via trait is also possible to be used. As this requires a llitle bit more code transformation and aiding during macros expansion, we shoud specify it explicitly both on the interface and the implementers:\r\n```rust\r\n#[graphql_interface(dyn = DynCharacter)]  // <-- generates handy type alias for the trait object\r\n#[graphql_interface(for = [Human, Droid, Jedi])]  // <-- specify implementers\r\ntrait Character {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(GraphQLObject)]\r\n#[graphql(implements = dyn CharacterValue)]  // <-- `dyn` part is vital here, as an underlying trait is transformed\r\nstruct Human {\r\n    id: String,\r\n}\r\n#[graphql_interface(dyn)]  // <-- `dyn` part is vital here, as an underlying trait is transformed\r\nimpl Character for Human {\r\n    fn id(&self) -> &str {\r\n        &self.id\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] `derive(GraphQLObject)`/`graphql_object` macros:\r\n    - [x] support `implements`

effect, also fixes #663\r\nAlso, related to #295 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Background and motivation\r\n\r\n__TL;DR__: current codegen for GraphQL unions is not much flexible and is too magic.\r\n\r\n- `#[derive(GraphQLUnion)]` macro:\r\n    - Applicable only to enums.\r\n    - Doesn't support generics on type, even if they're not required for type resolution.\r\n    - Cannot work with multiple `#[graphql]` attributes, just pickups first and silently ignores others.\r\n    - Not cleverly enough generates `From` implementations, which leads to painful conflicts.\r\n- `#[graphql_union]` macro:\r\n    - The code being fed into macro [looks like a valid Rust code](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/blob/5f777e8a6dc1c5b947b5fae578e9307ab2e24558/integration_tests/juniper_tests/src/codegen/impl_union.rs#L38-L43), but actually is not.\r\n    - Operates with types/traits which don't really exist (`GraphQLUnion`), and declares `impl` blocks which don't exist after macro expansion too.\r\n\r\nWe definitelly want less magic, applying custom behavior in an ergonomic and convenient way and operate with valid Rust code for better IDE experience.\r\n\r\n## New design\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it provides a single `#[derive(GraphQLUnion)]` macro which allows to modify resolution logic with custom functions. This is the same what `serde` does with `#[derive(Serialize)]` macro and `#[serde(with = \"my_func\")]` attribute.\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(GraphQLUnion, derive_more::From)]\r\n#[graphql(name = \"TheCharacter\", desc = \"Superb character\")]\r\n#[graphql(context = MyContext)]  // <-- if not specified, then Context is `()`\r\n#[graphql(scalar = juniper::DefaultScajarValue)] // <-- if not specified, then generated code is parametrized by `__S: ScalarValue`\r\n#[graphql(on Jedi = Character::as_jedi)]\r\n#[graphql(on Jedi = Character::as_better_jedi)]  // <-- emits compile-time duplication error\r\n#[graphql(on Sith = Character::as_sith)]  // <-- resolution logic doesn't require the type to be a part of enum\r\npub enum Character<T> {\r\n    One(Human),  // <-- will be trivially resolved as expected\r\n\r\n    #[graphql(with = Character::as_droid)]\r\n    Two(Droid),  // <-- will be resolved with `Character::as_droid` function\r\n\r\n    #[graphql(ignore)]\r\n    #[from(ignore)]\r\n    Three<T>,   // <-- will be skipped\r\n\r\n    #[graphql(with = Character::as_jedi)]  // <-- emits compile-time duplication error\r\n    #[from(ignore)]\r\n    Jedi,  // <-- if custom resolver specified, the variant doesn't have to containt the single type value\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<T> Character<T> {\r\n    // We can use in fuctions as context any type which implements `FromContext<MyContext>`.\r\n    fn as_droid(&self, _: &()) -> Option<&Droid> {\r\n        if let Self::Two(droid) = self {\r\n            Some(droid)\r\n        } else {\r\n            None\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn as_jedi(&self, ctx: &MyContext) -> Option<&Droid> {\r\n       ctx.can_i_haz_the_jedi_please()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn as_sith(&self, ctx: &SithContext) -> Option<&Sith> {\r\n       ctx.deploy_new_sith_here()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the described above is applicable in the same manner to struct types too.\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(GraphQLUnion]\r\n#[graphql(name = \"TheCharacter\", desc = \"Superb character\")]\r\n#[graphql(context = MyContext)]  // <-- if not specified, then Context is `()`\r\n#[graphql(scalar = juniper::DefaultScajarValue)] // <-- if not specified, then generated code is parametrized by `__S: ScalarValue`\r\n#[graphql(on Jedi = Character::resolve_jedi, on Sith = Character::deploy_sith)]`\r\nstruct TheCharacter<T>(PhantomData<T>);\r\n\r\nimpl<T> Character<T> {\r\n    fn resolve_jedi(&self, ctx: &Context) -> Option<&Jedi> {\r\n        ctx.can_i_haz_the_jedi_please()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn deploy_sith(&self, ctx: &SithContext) -> Option<&Sith> {\r\n        ctx.deploy_new_sith_here()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, for enums, the innerhood `From` implementations are removed. It's better to used `derive_more::From` for that purpose, which does stuff in much more clever way, and will preserve a bit more of SRP for our macro.\r\n\r\nHowever, to support traits, we still need to provide `#[graphql_union]` macro, as `proc_macro_derive` cannot be placed on trait declarations. And to avoid collisions with `#[graphql]` helper attribute (which will result in compilation error), we shoud use `#[graphql_union]` even for methods.\r\n```rust\r\n#[graphq_union(name = \"Character\", desc = \"Traited character\")]\r\n#[graphq_union(context = MyContext)]  // <-- if not specified, then auto-inferred from methods, if possible, otherwise is `()`\r\n#[graphq_union(scalar = juniper::DefaultScajarValue)] // <-- if not specified, then generated code is parametrized by `__S: ScalarValue`\r\n#[graphq_union(on Jedi = custom_resolve_as_jedi)]  // <-- it's possible even for traits!\r\ntrait Character {  // <-- trait, however, needs to be object-safe as dynamic dispatch is involved\r\n    fn as_human(&self) -> Option<&Human> { None } // <-- we can omit context here if we want\r\n    fn as_droid(&self, _: &Context) -> Option<&Droid> { None }\r\n    #[graphq_union(ignore)]\r\n    fn unrelated_trait_method(&self) { }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Character for Human {\r\n    fn as_human(&self) -> Option<&Human> {\r\n        Some(self)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Character for Droid {\r\n    fn as_droid(&self, _: &Context) -> Option<&Droid> {\r\n        Some(self)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn custom_resolve_as_jedi(ch: &dyn Character, ctx: &MyContext) -> Option<&Jedi> {\r\n     ctx.can_i_haz_the_jedi_please(ch)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR:\r\n- Adds `juniper::marker::GraphQLUnion` trait, to not reffer in the code to unexistent trait/types.\r\n- Relaxes `Sized` requirement on `GraphQLType` trait to allow implement it for bare trait objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Fully valid Rust code. No magic at all. All macro are additive and only add new code without transforming/removing existing.\r\n- Idiomatic and familiar way for handling custom logic in proc macros: `#[attr(with = func_name)]`.\r\n- No need to choose between macros. There is a single macro for each situation, which still allows tweaking with custom behavior/logic.\r\n- Multiple `#[graphql]` attributes are supported.\r\n- Generics are supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n##

redudant boxing here and there.\r\n\r\n### `juniper`\r\n- [x] Refactor `HTTPIntegration` to support `application/graphql` requests:\r\n    - rename `HTTPIntegration` as `HttpIntegration`;\r\n    - rename `post` as `post_json` method;\r\n    - add `post_graphql` method.\r\n- [x] Add `test_graphql_post` and `test_invalid_graphql_post`.\r\n- [x] Update CHANGELOG/docs/examples.\r\n\r\n### `juniper_actix`\r\n- [x] Update tests to support new `HttpIntegration`.\r\n- [x] Fix `application/graphql` POST request support:\r\n    - At the moment it deserializes request's body as JSON, which is not correct.\r\n- [x] ~~Update CHANGELOG/docs/examples.~~ (initial release, so not CHANGELOG yet)\r\n\r\n### `juniper_hyper`\r\n- [x] Update tests to support new `HttpIntegration`.\r\n- [x] Run tests

To ensure that these errors are fixed, a test suite is required. The test suite ensures that configurations which are not compliant to the specification, can not successfully compile.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nEach GraphQL type has a `Type Validation` chapter. Therefore, each of the constraints must be checked. An isolated Rust source snippet is created for each of these constraints. An external library compiles these snippets. The library ensures that the output of the compilation process is equal to an expected output. With the process it is ensured that these problems can not reoccur _silently_   in the future.\r\n\r\n# Goals (Progress)\r\n- [ ] Provider better error messages\r\n- [ ] Ensure that everything is specification conform\r\n- [ ] Implement GraphQLTypeAsync for missing parts (required for the test suite)\r\n\r\n# Related\r\n- https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/630\r\n-
