Types that derive `Decode` can declare fields as borrowing from input. This activates some special handling of `Cow`s, i.e. if they hold string or byte slices, the derived code will produce borrowed `Cow`s. This special handling does not kick in for types that do not derive `Decode`, e.g. `Vec`, `Option`, `BTreeMap` etc. `Cow`s as element types of such types will therefore not borrow from input data. To enable borrowing `Cow`s for such types, this PR adds two newtypes for `Cow<'_, str>` and `Cow<'_, [u8]>` that will always borrow from input, hence they are intended for use with `Vec`tors, `Option`s etc for cases where the usual `Cow` semantics are desired.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2807/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

provides initial support for message flow authorization within\r\nOckam nodes.\r\n\r\nAll incoming messages for an Ockam `Address` are now subject to an\r\nauthorization check implemented via the `AccessControl` trait before\r\nit will be accepted for further processing.\r\n\r\nMajor new api's introduced are:\r\n\r\n* `Context::start_worker_with_access_control(Address, Worker, AccessControl)`\r\n* `Context::new_repeater(AccessControl) -> RepeaterContext`\r\n* `Worker::is_authorized(&mut Self, Self::Context, Routed<Self::Message>)`\r\n* A new `access_control` attribute for the `#[ockam::node]` macro\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n\r\n### `DetachedContext`, `RepeaterContext`\r\n\r\nA `Context` with no associated worker or processor that can still send and receive messages.\r\n\r\nA `DetachedContext` inherits the access control of the parent `Context` which created it.\r\nA `RepeaterContext` requires that you specify access control for it on creation.\r\n\r\n### `Mailbox`\r\n\r\nA `Mailbox` is a single `Address` combined with `AccessControl`.\r\n\r\nPreviously a `Context` had a single `AccessControl` which was shared with all `Address`es.\r\n\r\n### `Mailboxes`\r\n\r\nReplaces `Context::address` with `Context::mailboxes`\r\n\r\nA collection of `Mailbox`es (`Address` + `AccessControl`)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n`Worker::handle_message` implementations that may have used a pattern like:\r\n\r\n    let msg = LocalMessage::decode(msg.payload())?;\r\n    self.handle_route(ctx, msg).await?;\r\n\r\nShould now use:\r\n\r\n    self.handle_route(ctx, msg.into_local_message()).await?;\r\n\r\n\r\n## A word about defaults\r\n\r\nAt present message flow authorization defaults to an `AllowAll` policy.\r\n\r\nThis is set by:\r\n\r\n* The `#[ockam::node]` macro creates the node's app `Context` with an\r\n  `AllowAll` policy when one has not been specified.\r\n* The `ockam::node::start_node()` function starts new nodes with an\r\n  `AllowAll` policy. You can use\r\n  `ockam::node::start_node_with_access_control()` to specify an\r\n  alternate policy.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this will migrate to a default of\r\n`LocalOriginOnly` as we update the rest of the codebase to use message\r\nflow authorization.\r\n\r\nAnother worthy goal may be to think about ways where we could set it\r\nto `DenyAll` by default without complectifying the ockam api learning\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The new `access_control` attribute for the `#[ockam::node]` macro\r\n\r\nBy default all nodes are started with an access control of `AllowAll`\r\nfor the `\"app\"` address.\r\n\r\nWhile we could have used the more restrictive `LocalOriginOnly` by\r\ndefault this would make our \"getting started\" examples more complex.\r\n\r\nAn example of overriding the default \"app\" access control is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    use hello_ockam::Echoer;\r\n    use ockam::access_control::{AllowedTransport, LocalOriginOnly};\r\n    use ockam::{Context, Result, TcpTransport, TCP};\r\n    use std::sync::Arc;\r\n\r\n    #[ockam::node(access_control = \"LocalOriginOnly\")]\r\n    async fn main(ctx: Context) -> Result<()> {\r\n        // Initialize the TCP Transport.\r\n        let tcp = TcpTransport::create(&ctx).await?;\r\n\r\n        // Create a TCP listener and wait for incoming connections.\r\n        tcp.listen(\"127.0.0.1:4000\").await?;\r\n\r\n        // Create an echoer worker\r\n        ctx.start_worker_with_access_control(\r\n            \"echoer\",\r\n            Echoer,\r\n            Arc::new(AllowedTransport::single(TCP))\r\n        )\r\n        .await?;\r\n\r\n        // Don't call ctx.stop() here so this node runs forever.\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom worker authorization handling with `Worker::is_authorized`\r\n\r\nThe worker trait has been extended with an optional `is_authorized` method:\r\n\r\n    async fn is_authorized(\r\n        &mut self,\r\n        _context: &mut Self::Context,\r\n        _msg: Routed<Self::Message>,\r\n    ) -> Result<bool> {\r\n        crate::allow()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis method will be invoked after any authorization performed on the\r\n`Address` of the worker and before the message is forwarded to the\r\nworker's `handle_message()` method is called.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for adding this trait instead of simply performing any\r\nextended authorization within the `Worker::handle_message()` call is\r\ntwofold:\r\n\r\n1. At some future point we may want to implement functionality to\r\n   optionally disable authorization checks for trouble-shooting\r\n   purposes.\r\n1. Explicit often works out better in the long run than implicit.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2803/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2803/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2797", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2797/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2797/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2797/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2797", "id": 1251803787, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCYdddc44otrU", "number": 2797, "title": "add enroll, space and project subcommands", "user": {"login": "adrianbenavides", "id": 12375782, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzc1Nzgy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12375782?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides", "html_url": "https://github.com/adrianbenavides", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-05-29T06:41:12Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-09T07:04:22Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-29T15:21:59Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/pulls/2797", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2797", "diff_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2797.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2797.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-29T15:21:59Z"}, "body": "- https://github.com/build-trust/codebase/issues/235\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAdds CLI commands for enroll, spaces and projects.\r\n\r\nTODOS:\r\n- [ ] The `enroll` payload is going to change in the coming days, so we'll have to adapt the rust side when it's ready\r\n- [ ] The CBOR schema differs between the rust and elixir codebases.
