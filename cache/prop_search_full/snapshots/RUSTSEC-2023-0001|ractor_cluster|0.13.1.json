I'm enabling a lot more warning messages on the core `ractor` crate in order to maintain a higher code quality. This induced a lot of needlessly `pub` functions to be marked as `pub(crate)` since the visibility was controlled by the parent struct anyways. Additionally a lot of `Debug` implementations are added for publicly exported types.\r\n2. This adds a new type called `RetriableMessage` which when used in conjunction with a `Factory` allows us to automatically retry a message should it be dropped due to a factory worker failing (or panicking). Tests added on this functionality.\r\n3. Lastly as requested in #272 and #248, with the stabilization of async traits natively, factories were gated behind the `async-trait` feature since we utilized `dyn Trait` with async methods, which is **not** natively supported. For those specific traits (`DynamicDiscardController`, `FactoryLifecycleHooks`, and `WorkerCapacityController`) I've migrated them to `BoxFuture<'_, TOutput>` in order to ungate factory usage with native async traits. This is thankfully possible due to the large factory rewrite that occurred in #237 which greatly improved the factory ergnomics.\r\n\r\n\r\nResolves #272 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/275/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/275/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/273", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/273/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/273/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/273/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/slawlor/ractor/pull/273", "id": 2580121368, "node_id": "PR_kwDOItvaRM5-SKzO", "number": 273, "title": "Missing callsites for a bunch of factory stats", "user": {"login": "slawlor", "id": 9451356, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk0NTEzNTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9451356?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor", "html_url": "https://github.com/slawlor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/slawlor/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-10-11T00:22:57Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-11T00:33:07Z", "closed_at": "2024-10-11T00:32:54Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/pulls/273", "html_url": "https://github.com/slawlor/ractor/pull/273", "diff_url": "https://github.com/slawlor/ractor/pull/273.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/slawlor/ractor/pull/273.patch", "merged_at": "2024-10-11T00:32:54Z"}, "body": "Some stat collection was lost in merging various branches.

This becomes especially annoying once one has to interface with an existing codebase that has the original types deeply ingrained.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional feature called \"blanket_serde\" which replaces the current default implementations of BytesConvertable with a blanket implementation utilizing serde and pot.\r\n\r\nIn the process a handful of bugs were found, where tests and BytesConvertable implementations were inconsistent in their Deserialization / Serialization.\r\nFor example there were cases of Strings into_bytes() function being used for serialization in combination with <String as BytesConvertable>::from_bytes being used for deserialization, this didn't cause any errors since the default implementation similarly just called .into_bytes().",

`async-std` runtime as an alternative to the `tokio` runtime. It can be enabled with the `async-std` feature.\r\n\r\nNote: `ractor` uses some core primitives or functionality of structs from `tokio` which required some wrapping to support in `async-std`. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. `tokio`'s `JoinHandle` has functionality to determine if a `JoinHandle` is finished as well as to abort it without consuming the handle. These required some wrapping in our `async_std_primatives` module to support similar functionality without great rewrites of `ractor`. Basic functionality test coverage is added for our custom `JoinHandle` implementation.\r\n2. `tokio` has a `JoinSet` which has some minor syntactical changes from the standard `FuturesUnordered` from the futures crate which we can leverage in its stead. Again a small wrapper was added.\r\n3. `tokio` has an `Interval` which is used to fix #57, this doesn't exist in `async-std` aside from a basic `sleep` implementation, so we had to add a custom version of it.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/173/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,
