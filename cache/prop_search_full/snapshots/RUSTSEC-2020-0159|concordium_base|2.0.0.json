protocol. We also adopt the [singletons library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) and broadly use that where we have previously defined singletons directly.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/issues/638 together with\r\nhttps://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node/pull/653 \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nChanges to the parameters:\r\n- Election difficulty is generalised to \"consensus parameters\". For <P6, this is just the election difficulty. For P6, this consists of:\r\n  - Timeout parameters: Timeout base time, timeout increase factor, timeout decrease factor.\r\n  - Minimum block time.\r\n  - Block energy limit.\r\n- The consensus parameters are updatable with the same keys as for the election difficulty:\r\n  - The access structure `asParamElectionDifficulty` is renamed to `asParamConsensusParameters`.\r\n  - For JSON serialization of the level 2 authorizations, `electionParameters` is still used. This is to maintain compatibility, and since the old GRPC API is deprecated.\r\n  - (It is renamed to `parameter_consensus` in the GRPC2 API. Renaming does not break binary compatibility.)\r\n  - Each of the three new consensus parameters is updatable independently, though with the same keys.\r\n- The GAS reward for including finalization proofs has been removed.\r\n\r\nTechnical changes:\r\n- Use the singletons library to construct the existing singletons for `ProtocolVersion`, `ChainParametersVersion`, `AccountVersion` and `TransactionOutcomesVersion`. Generally, the same interface is maintained, however:\r\n  - The constructors of `SChainParametersVersion` are renamed, e.g. `SCPV0` to `SChainParametersV0`.\r\n  - Where the `IsProtocolVersion` constraint is used, the module should use `{-# LANGUAGE MonoLocalBinds #-}` (or `TypeFamilies` or `GADTs`, which imply this) to avoid warnings.\r\n- `JustForCPV1` is removed. It is replaced with two new types:\r\n  - `Conditionally`, with constructors `CTrue` and `CFalse`, holds a value if the type-level boolean parameters is `True`.\r\n  - `OParam`, with constructors `SomeParam` and `NoParam`, holds a value if the chain parameters version supports the given parameter type.\r\n- A number of new versioning types that are dependent on `ChainParametersVersion` are introduced for fine-grained control of version specific parameters:\r\n  - `MintDistributionVersion`:\r\n    - `MintDistributionVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`): supports mint per slot.\r\n    - `MintDistributionVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`): does not support mint per slot.\r\n  - `GASRewardsVersion`:\r\n    - `GASRewardsVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`, `ChainParametersV1`): supports GAS reward for finalization proofs.\r\n    - `GASRewardsVersion1` (`ChainParametersV2`): does not support GAS reward for finalization proofs.\r\n  - `CooldownParametersVersion`:\r\n    - `CooldownParametersVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`): baker cooldown specified in epochs.\r\n    - `CooldownParametersVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`): baker and delegator cooldowns specified in seconds.\r\n  - `PoolParametersVersion`:\r\n    - `PoolParametersVersion0`: (`ChainParametersV0`): minimum stake for registering a baker.\r\n    - `PoolParametersVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`):\r\n      - passive commission rates\r\n      - bounds on pool commission rates\r\n      - minimum baker equity capital\r\n      - leverage bound for a baker\r\n  - `ConsensusParametersVersion`:\r\n    - `ConsensusParametersVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`, `ChainParametersV1`): election difficulty\r\n    - `ConsensusParametersVersion1` (`ChainParametersV2`):\r\n        - Timeout parameters\r\n        - Minimum block time\r\n        - Block energy limit\r\n  - `AuthorizationsVersion`:\r\n    - `AuthorizationsVersion0` (`ChainParametersV0`).\r\n    - `AuthorizationsVersion1` (`ChainParametersV1`, `ChainParametersV2`): add access structures for cooldown parameters and time parameters.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] My code follows the style of this project.\r\n- [X] The code compiles without warnings.\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of the changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my code, in particular the intent of the\r\n      hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [ ] (If necessary) I have updated the CHANGELOG.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/288/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/288/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/285", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/285/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/285/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/285/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/285", "id": 1500796190, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFQNx-c5FrAHa", "number": 285, "title": "Bump the contracts-common dependency.", "user": {"login": "abizjak", "id": 105212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak", "html_url": "https://github.com/abizjak", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abizjak/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-12-16T20:08:51Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-17T19:41:46Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-17T19:41:46Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/pulls/285", "html_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/285", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/285.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/285.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-17T19:41:46Z"}, "body": "## Purpose\r\n\r\ncontracts-common version is bumped for release.
