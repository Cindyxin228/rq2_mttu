In particular, distributed build caches incorporate an assumption that build outputs are a deterministic function of the inputs.

So this PR introduces a cfg called `deterministic_based_on_span` which causes the value emitted by const_random to be a deterministic hash based on the call site's [proc_macro::Span](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.Span.html).\r\n\r\nThis is implemented using a rustc cfg rather than a Cargo feature because it isn't something that downstream code should be allowed to enable/disable. It is a property that the build environment decides.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nTested with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse const_random::const_random;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    const RANDOM: (u32, u32) =
