The MSRV on Windows targets is effectively 1.61, but other targets do not require these features.\n\nThe `webview2-com` crate specifies `rust-version = \"1.61\"`, so `wry` will inherit that MSRV and developers on Windows should get a clear error message telling them to update their toolchain when building `wry` or anything that depends on `wry`.

A lambda must instead be provided that is executed within the navigation event handler itself - what difference this makes is unclear, however it does not appear to be a major drawback from what I have seen\r\n- A basic example is included - it demonstrates some notable drawbacks, including: not preventing javascript that effectively rewrites a page (most noticeable when navigating to Twitter and then opening any other user's feeds) and it also does not prevent popups (a future PR or enhancement to this one could prevent this, on Windows at least)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/519/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/519/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/516", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/516/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/516/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/516/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/516", "id": 1158895685, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEKKTFs4z6py9", "number": 516, "title": "fix(deps): update rust crate once_cell to 1.10", "user": {"login": "renovate[bot]", "id": 29139614, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90MjkxMzk2MTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2740?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/renovate", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-03-03T21:03:14Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-04T03:37:04Z", "closed_at": "2022-03-04T03:37:01Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/pulls/516", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/516", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/516.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/516.patch", "merged_at": "2022-03-04T03:37:01Z"}, "body": "[![WhiteSource Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [once_cell](https://crates.io/crates/once_cell) | dependencies | minor | `1.9` -> `1.10` |\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
