attempts to implement a new, more efficient and also more generic `ArrowArrayReader`, as a replacement to both the `PrimitiveArrayReader` and `ComplexObjectArrayReader` that exist today. The basic idea behind the new `ArrowArrayReader` \r\n is to copy contiguous byte slices from parquet page buffers to arrow array buffers as directly as possible, while avoiding unnecessary memory allocation as much as possible. While for primitive types such as Int32, the performance improvements are small in most cases, for complex types such as strings the performance improvements can be significant (up to 6 times faster). See benchmark results below.\r\n\r\nI did try initially to use iterators end-to-end as suggested by the linked issue, but this required a more complex and less efficient implementation which was ultimately slower. This is why in this PR iterators are only used to map parquet pages to implementations of the `ValueDecoder` trait trait which know how to read / decode byte slices for batches of values.\r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\nThis PR implements the new `ArrowArrayReader` and converters for strings and primitive types, but is only used / enabled for strings. The plan is to enable / use the new `ArrowArrayReader` for more types in subsequent PRs. Also note that `ValueDecoder`s for only `PLAIN` and `RLE_DICTIONARY` encodings are currently implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Are there any user-facing changes?\r\nThere are some non-breaking changes to `MutableArrayData` and `SlicesIterator`, @jorgecarleitao  let me know what you think about those.\r\n\r\nHere are the benchmark results:\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - old: time:   [9.0238 us 9.1121 us 9.2100 us]\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - new: time:   [6.9506 us 7.1606 us 7.4062 us]\r\n\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, optional, no NULLs -
