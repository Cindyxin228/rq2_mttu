Based on work started by @Anakael [here](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery/pull/277#issuecomment-996168247).\r\n\r\nThe basic approach is to `Box<dyn *>` the broker and all types used in that trait. I've had to create a few wrappers around types from crates in order to implement the needed traits, mostly for the `AMQPBroker`.\r\n\r\nSomething I'm not crazy about is the methods in the Delivery trait. It seemed the cleanest logic wise to have the deliveries know how to `ack` and `resend`, but from an architecture perspective it smells to me. I didn't want to introduce to many big changes in one PR though.
