Cookies](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#cookies) in the WebDriver spec. In particular, I've implemented the following operations:\r\n\r\n* Get All Cookies\r\n* Get Named Cookie\r\n* Delete Cookie\r\n* Delete All Cookies\r\n\r\nThe last operation, \"Add Cookie\", requires support from the `webdriver` crate.  The primary issue is that the `AddCookieParameters` struct does not implement `Serialize`, which means that we can't build the POST request on our side.  I'll be trying to get in touch with the geckodriver folks to see if this can be changed on their end.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a new module, `cookies.rs`.  This module contains the cookie-related `Client` methods as well as a few functions for converting between raw JSON (from WebDriver) and `cookie::Cookie` for the APIs.\r\n* Added a simple integration testcase that triggers the `get_all_cookies` and `delete_all_cookies` operations.\r\n* Removed the `binary` flag/arg when creating the WebDriver test client.  Both `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` are able to detect the path to the browser binary automatically on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nCloses #59.", "reactions": {"url":

WebDriver send errors which fantoccini don't expect and silently panic with `unreachable!()`. This don't give information about why fantoccini panic and doesn't allow to deal with it.\r\n\r\nAlso I refactored code a bit. Fields with one letter name do not give understanding to those who see the code for the first time about what they store. Also specifying PATCH version in `Cargo.toml` don't make sense because `cargo` will ignore it and automatically bump PATCH version of those crates.\r\n\r\nI added crate [serial_test_derive] for speedup your integration tests. This crate can run tests marked with `#[serial]` on one thread and other tests on multi thread. Since \"chromedriver\" can run several sessions in parallel, it is more reasonable to run tests for it in parallel, and \"geckodriver\" - in one thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n[serial_test_derive]:

support for the cookie operations defined in [16. Cookies](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#cookies) in the WebDriver spec. In particular, I've implemented the following operations:\r\n\r\n* Get All Cookies\r\n* Get Named Cookie\r\n* Delete Cookie\r\n* Delete All Cookies\r\n\r\nThe last operation, \"Add Cookie\", requires support from the `webdriver` crate.  The primary issue is that the `AddCookieParameters` struct does not implement `Serialize`, which means that we can't build the POST request on our side.  I'll be trying to get in touch with the geckodriver folks to see if this can be changed on their end.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a new module, `cookies.rs`.  This module contains the cookie-related `Client` methods as well as a few functions for converting between raw JSON (from WebDriver) and `cookie::Cookie` for the APIs.\r\n* Added a simple integration testcase that triggers the `get_all_cookies` and `delete_all_cookies` operations.\r\n* Removed the `binary` flag/arg when creating the WebDriver test client.

The primary issue is that the `AddCookieParameters` struct does not implement `Serialize`, which means that we can't build the POST request on our side.
