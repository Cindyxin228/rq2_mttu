method,\r\nit should be possible to predict whether it will fit in the limit defined by\r\nthe `max_transmit_size` config option.\r\nIf this limit applies to the final protobuf payload, it's not possible to know\r\nthat in advance because the size of the added fields is not fixed.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the limit apply to the passed message size instead of the final wire size.\r\n\r\n##

So we should not continue to advertise the \"candidate\" event.\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nWe have made the changes in the `swarm` instead of `identify` because it does not make it necessary to duplicate the `ConfirmedExternalAddr` vector in the `identify` Behaviour. Moreover, if any future Behaviour emit `NewExternalAddrCandidate`, the same rule will also be applied. \r\n\r\nI had to edit the `autonat_v2` tests which were always expecting a `NewExternalAddrCandidate` but the address was already confirmed.\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.
