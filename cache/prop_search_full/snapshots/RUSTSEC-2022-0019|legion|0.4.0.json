This fixes #228.\r\n\r\nI think that the `EntitySerializer` and `CustomEntitySerializer` traits could do with better names, but I've held off on that as I can't think of names that really work well.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/230/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/230/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/202", "id": 709807741, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDkzNzcxMzE0", "number": 202, "title": "Update repository link in Cargo.toml", "user": {"login": "nominolo", "id": 5943, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5943?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/nominolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2730606048, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNzMwNjA2MDQ4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/labels/type:%20maintenance", "name": "type: maintenance", "color": "84b6eb", "default": false, "description": "A task that has no noticeable user-facing effect.

The function maked with the attribute is left as-is, so auto-complete and other IDE tooling continue to function as normal.\r\n\r\nTo copy and paste the docs for the macro:\r\n\r\n## #[system]\r\nWraps a function in a system, and generates a new function which constructs that system.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of systems: simple (default), for_each and par_for_each. By default, the system macro will create a new function named `<attributed_fn_name>_system` which can be called to construct the system.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nBy default, the system function is called once when the system runs.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system]\r\nfn hello_world() {\r\n   println!(\"hello world\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nSchedule::builder()\r\n    .add_system(hello_world_system())\r\n    .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function can request resources with reference parameters marked with the #[resource] attribute.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system]\r\nfn hello_world(#[resource] person: &Person) {\r\n   println!(\"hello, {}\", person.name);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSystems can also request a world or command buffer.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system]\r\nfn create_entity(world: &mut SubWorld, cmd: &mut CommandBuffer) {\r\n   cmd.push((1usize, false, Person { name: \"Jane Doe\" }));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSystems can declare access to component types with the #[read_component] and #[write_component] attributes.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system]\r\n#[read_component(usize)]\r\n#[write_component(bool)]\r\nfn run_query(world: &mut SubWorld) {\r\n    let mut query = <(Read<usize>, Write<bool>)>::query();\r\n    for (a, b) in query.iter_mut(world) {\r\n        println!(\"{} {}\", a, b);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor_each and par_for_each system types can be used to implement the query for you. References will be interpreted as Read<T> and Write<T>, while options of references (e.g. Option<&Position>) will be interpreted as TryRead<T> and TryWrite<T>. You can request the entity ID via a &Entity parameter.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system(for_each)]\r\nfn update_positions(pos: &mut Position, vel: &Velocity, #[resource] time: &Time) {\r\n    pos.x += vel.x * time.seconds;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor_each and par_for_each systems can request attitional filters for their query via the #[filter] attribute.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system(for_each)]\r\n#[filter(maybe_changed::<Position>())]\r\nfn update_positions(pos: &mut Position, vel: &Velocity, #[resource] time: &Time) {\r\n    pos.x += vel.x * time.seconds;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSystems can contain their own state. Add a reference marked with the #[state] parameter to your function. This state will be initialized when you construct the system.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system]\r\nfn stateful(#[state] counter: &mut usize) {\r\n    *counter += 1;\r\n    println!(\"state: {}\", counter);\r\n}\r\n\r\nSchedule::builder()\r\n     // initialize state when you construct the system\r\n    .add_system(stateful_system(5usize))\r\n    .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSystems can contain generic parameters.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system(for_each)]\r\nfn print_component<T: Component + Debug>(component: &T) {\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", component);\r\n}\r\n\r\nSchedule::builder()\r\n     // supply generic parameters when constructing the system\r\n    .add_system(print_component_system::<Position>())\r\n    .build();\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/165/reactions", "total_count": 20, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 11, "confused": 0, "heart": 9, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/165/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/115", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/115/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/115/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/115/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/115", "id": 577572141, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1MzE4NDQ5", "number": 115, "title": "Experimental refactor in legion_experiment crate", "user": {"login": "TomGillen", "id": 534054, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDA1NA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/534054?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen", "html_url": "https://github.com/TomGillen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomGillen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 36, "created_at": "2020-03-08T21:51:03Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-27T07:14:05Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-27T07:13:48Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/pulls/115", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/115", "diff_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/115.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/115.patch", "merged_at": "2020-07-27T07:13:48Z"}, "body": "This started as a simple refactor of legion into smaller sub-modules, as some of the module files were well over 1k LoC and were getting unmaintainable. However, while moving things around, I found some soundness issues and saw some opportunity to simplify things. Those in turn caused more changes downstream, and the simplifications made other improvements that I had been planning fairly trivial to implement. This ended up being a _much_ larger and more impactful refactor of the entire legion_core crate than I had originally planned. This work is not yet complete, but it is wide reaching enough that I want to give everyone the opportunity to see what I've been doing and collect some feedback.\r\n\r\nThe general changes are:\r\n * Much shorter module files, each with a more clearly defined scope.\r\n * Simpler code in general. I don't have a line count yet, but I expect this to have shaved a few hundred lines off the library overall.\r\n * Removed many uses of `unsafe`.\r\n\r\nChanges to `World` (which now more closely resembles a std collection):\r\n * Added `len` to retrieve entity count.\r\n * Renamed `insert` to `extend`.\r\n * Added `push` as sugar for inserting a single entity.\r\n * Renamed `delete` to `remove`.\r\n * Renamed `is_alive` to `contains`.\r\n * Added `entity(Entity) -> Entry` and `entity_mut(Entity) -> EntryMut` functions. Entries contain the APIs for interacting with a single entity. e.g. `get_component`, `add_component` and `layout` (which in turn offers `has_component` etc).\r\n * `iter` and `iter_mut` for iterating through all entity entries.\r\n * You can now insert with a tuple of component vecs, in addition to an iterator of component tuples. This is about 50% faster.\r\n\r\nChanges to storage:\r\n * Much clearer distinction between structural changes to storage (e.g. adding entities) and the interior mutability involved in accessing components.\r\n * Chunk metadata has been pulled out into a `LayoutIndex`.\r\n * The layout index is optimised for search and provides a `.search(EntityFilter) -> impl Iterator<Item = ArchetypeIndex>` function.\r\n * Renamed \"archetype\" to \"layout\".\r\n * Renamed \"chunk set\" to \"archetype\".\r\n * Storage now derefs into `[Archetype]` and can be indexed by `ArchetypeIndex`.\r\n * Chunks no longer free their internal memory when empty. Defrag now deletes empty chunks.\r\n * Event subscribers can ask to recieve initial creation/insertion events for pre-existing archetypes and entities when they subscribe.\r\n\r\nChanges to filters:\r\n * No longer implemented as iterators. This was a pain without GATs (it is the canonical streaming iterator problem).\r\n * Filters now only provide their matching logic.\r\n * Distinction made between stateless layout/archetype filters and stateful chunk filters.\r\n * Filters can now _cache their matches_ and incrementally update queries. System queries should do this by default in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that `SystemQuery` won't be needed anymore, too.\r\n\r\nI don't forsee any more major API changes beyond completing this rework, and legion v1.0.0 will likely closely resemble this, after which things should stabilise and breaking changes will hopefully be rare.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/115/reactions", "total_count": 21, "+1": 13, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 8, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/115/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/202/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/202", "id": 709807741, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDkzNzcxMzE0", "number": 202, "title": "Update repository link in Cargo.toml", "user": {"login": "nominolo", "id": 5943, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5943?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/nominolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nominolo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2730606048, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNzMwNjA2MDQ4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/labels/type:%20maintenance", "name": "type: maintenance", "color": "84b6eb", "default": false, "description": "A task that has no noticeable user-facing effect.
