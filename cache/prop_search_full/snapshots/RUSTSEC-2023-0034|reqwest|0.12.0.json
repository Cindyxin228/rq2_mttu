So for example, a client makes, say, 500 concurrent requests to an HTTP/2 server while the server's `max_concurrent_streams` is set to 100. In this case the client is allowed to initiate 500 concurrent streams _until_ the initial `SETTINGS` frame from the server reaches to the client, though the server will reject 400 streams by responding `REFUSED_STREAM`.\r\nFrom the standpoint of users of `reqwest` crate, I would expect the crate to deal with this kind of situation behind the scenes. Actually, as far as I searched, Go and libcurl provides the retry logic when they encounter `REFUSED_STREAM`. Considering the \"ergonomic, batteries-included\" characteristic of `reqwest`, I believe automatic retry would be very nice to have.\r\n\r\nHere's a repo containing reproducible code written in a couple different languages. It also has `rust-patched` code which demonstrates that this patch does fix the issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/magurotuna/deno-fetch-h2-stream-error-repro", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2081/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 4, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2081/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2059", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2059/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2059/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2059/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/2059", "id": 2031155787, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA7dkLM5hcbj3", "number": 2059, "title": "hyper v1 upgrade", "user": {"login": "seanmonstar", "id": 51479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 14, "created_at": "2023-12-07T16:55:52Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-09T16:40:17Z", "closed_at": "2024-03-08T22:07:15Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/pulls/2059", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/2059", "diff_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/2059.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/2059.patch", "merged_at": "2024-03-08T22:07:15Z"}, "body": "The upgrade process to hyper v1, which is tracked in #2039.
