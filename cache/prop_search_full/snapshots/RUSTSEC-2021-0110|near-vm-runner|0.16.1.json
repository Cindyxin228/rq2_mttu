https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/1.32.0/chain/client/src/sync/state.rs#L607 that spawns a future from an Actix handler, in order to send a message to another Actor and awaiting on the response.\r\n\r\nSo for testing, this code would be refactored so that instead of `near_performance_metrics::actix::spawn`, we would use `future_spawner.spawn`, where the `future_spawner: &dyn FutureSpawner` is passed in. It's passed in either as `ActixFutureSpawner` (from the ClientActor), or as a `DelaySender<Arc<TestLoopTask>>` from a test loop handler.\r\n\r\nInside, when it says `.send_async(...).then(...)`, the TestLoop will provide that send_async implementation with a `DelaySender<MessageExpectingResponse<PeerManagerMessageRequest, PeerManagerMessageResponse>>`.\r\n\r\nBoth of these will go into the test loop, where the `DriveFutures` handler will drive the future that was spawned, and the handler for `MessageExpectingResponse<PeerManagerMessageRequest, PeerManagerMessageResponse>` will execute the network adapter part of the logic. In other words, with this PR we can now, in theory, directly support the testing of all actix-based code in nearcore, as long as they use Sender and AsyncSender (whose migration was already partially done).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8630/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8630/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8628", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8628/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8628/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8628/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8628", "id": 1595517303, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCQUkYs5KiRn5", "number": 8628, "title": "feat: Dump and apply state changes for a range of blocks.", "user": {"login": "nikurt", "id": 86772482, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzcyNDgy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86772482?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikurt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikurt/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-02-22T17:33:23Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-09T16:30:14Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-09T16:30:12Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/pulls/8628", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8628", "diff_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8628.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8628.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-09T16:30:12Z"}, "body": "This simulates shard shadowing.\r\nIn order to fully correctly replay state changes and get matching state roots, all kinds of state changes need to be applied, including the ones which currently are filtered out.
