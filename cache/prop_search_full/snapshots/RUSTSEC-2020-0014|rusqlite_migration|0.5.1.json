One new dev dependency.\r\n- Improve logging somewhat\r\n- New error variants\r\n- Deprecated and hidden `MigrateToLowerNotSupported`. It's kept for back-compat, ideally should be removed.\r\n\r\nI split it to smaller commits, so you can cherry-pick if you like, but I think all the changes make sense\r\n\r\nSome things I noticed:\r\n- If `SchemaVersion::Inside` was not off-by-one, it would be more straightforward to use. `.to_version()` uses the natural version numbering: 0=nothing run yet, 1 = after first migration, etc.\r\n- Proposing to rename `.latest()` to `.to_latest()` or similar (just keep the two migrating methods consistent). \"latest\" doesn't evoke \"migrate to latest version\" in me at a first glance,
