contains the project id / host name so that it is still possible to query for all the traces related to a given project if necessary\r\n - The trace id incorporates the date as `YYMMDD` so that we can quickly identify when the actions took place\r\n - The `YYMMDD` dates are created in 5 days buckets so that the creation of journeys is very deterministic, even \r\n   if user actions are executed from different nodes on different days.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7643/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

"2024-02-23T15:30:46Z"}, "body": "This PR enables tracing by default.\r\n\r\nThe biggest changes consists in:\r\n\r\n 1. Checking if the OpenTelemetry collector endpoint is accessible before deciding to enable tracing.\r\n 2. Working around some possible deadlocks in the tracing library around shutdown behaviour.\r\n 3. Refactoring the setup of commands so that\r\n    - The setup code is easier to navigate.\r\n    - Environment variables are only read once to build the logging/tracing configuration.\r\n\r\n**The `OCKAM_TRACING` environment variable is to set to `false` by default in that PR. Once we will have tested tracing well enough, I will open a PR to set it to `true`**.\r\n\r\n## Endpoint accessibility\r\n\r\nWe want to both enable tracing by default, and make sure that the command line stays responsive if the endpoint is not accessible or misconfigured.\r\n\r\nTracing is only enabled if the endpoint can be accessed with a TCP connection:\r\n\r\n - A default connection timeout of `500ms` is used. This is the result of experimenting with\r\n     - An accessible endpoint, which should shown as available in that time or earlier.\r\n     - An inaccessible endpoint, which should be shown as unavailable in that time or earlier.\r\n - If `quiet` is set to `true` then a message is displayed when tracing is not available.\r\n   \r\n## Deadlocks\r\n\r\nThe deadlock issue is opened [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/issues/1395). The workaround in this PR is to have a `LogProcessor` and a `SpanProcessor` which just flush on shutdown.\r\n\r\n## Refactorings\r\n\r\n### `ockam_api::config`\r\n\r\nThat module has been refactored to:\r\n\r\n - Remove the unused code for `atomic`, `ConfigValues`, `Config`.\r\n - Put in `ockam_api::config` some environment variables types:\r\n     - `DurationVar` to parse `Durations`.\r\n     - `UrlVar` to parse `Url`s.\r\n     - `BooleanVar` to parse boolean values.\r\n     - `LevelVar` to parse log levels.\r\n\r\n### `ockam_api::logs`\r\n\r\nThat module has been refactored into many other modules:\r\n\r\n- `current_span` convenience functions to set attributes on the current span\r\n- `default_values` constant values used by default to configure logging / tracing\r\n- `env_variables` list of environment variables which can be used to configure logging / tracing\r\n- `log_exporters` (resp. `span_exporters`) implementations for the `LogExporter` trait. So far there is only a `DecoratedLogExporter` implementation which is useful to quickly intercept exported logs\r\n- `log_processors` (resp. `span_processors`) implementations for the `LogProcessor` trait. It contains a `NonBlockingLogProcessor` which decorates any `LogProcessor` to avoid doing a shutdown, since this can trigger deadlocks\r\n- `logging_configuration` data type describing all the possible values for configuring logging and where to get them from.\r\n- `logging_options` data types describing some configuration options for logging\r\n- `setup` main place where we configure the logging and tracing layers\r\n- `tracing_guard` maintains the logging / tracing resources alive while a command is executed, or a background node running.\r\n\r\n### `ockam_command`\r\n\r\nThe top-level code for creating and running an `OckamCommand` was becoming too bloated. The following files have been created / modified:\r\n\r\n- `arguments` contains helper methods to parse input arguments\r\n- `command_events` creates user events when a command executes\r\n- `command_global_opts` extracts in its own file the `CommandGlobalOpts` data type\r\n- `global_args` extracts in its own file the `GlobalArgs` data type \r\n- `ockam_command` create the `CommandGlobalOpts`, sets up logging/tracing, and run the subcommand\r\n- `ockam_subcommand` enum with all the top level commands: `node`, `project`, `identity`, etc...\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7606/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7606/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7605", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7605/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7605/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7605/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7605", "id": 2139212701, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCYdddc5nHrUF", "number": 7605, "title": "build: bump clap from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2161200656, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTYxMjAwNjU2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/labels/Implementation:%20Rust", "name": "Implementation: Rust", "color": "2be2ca", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 3675505613, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCYdddc7bE8PN", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/labels/Type:%20Dependencies", "name": "Type: Dependencies", "color": "B6B6A5", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-16T18:47:04Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-19T15:32:02Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-19T15:32:01Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/pulls/7605", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7605", "diff_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7605.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7605.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-19T15:32:01Z"}, "body": "Bumps [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/releases\">clap's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.5.1</h2>\n<h2>[4.5.1] - 2024-02-16</h2>\n<h3>Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(error)</em> Include suggestion to add <code>--</code> even if there is a &quot;did you mean&quot;

This removes the confusion between chrono's type and the later <code>Duration</code> type in the standard library. It will remain available under the old name as a type alias for compatibility.</li>\n<li>The Windows implementation of <code>Local</code> is rewritten. The new version avoids panics when the date is outside of the range supported by windows (the years 1601 to 30828), and gives more accurate results during DST transitions.</li>\n<li>The <code>Display</code> format of <code>TimeDelta</code> is modified to conform better to ISO 8601. Previously it converted all values greater than 24 hours to a value with days. This is not correct, as doing so changes the duration from an 'accurate' to a 'nominal' representation to use ISO 8601 terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add missing range check in <code>TimeDelta::milliseconds</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1385\">#1385</a>, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/danwilliams\"><code>@\u200bdanwilliams</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Remove check for <code>DurationExceedsTimestamp</code> in <code>DurationRound</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1403\">#1403</a>, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/joroKr21\"><code>@\u200bjoroKr21</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Fix localized formatting with <code>%X</code> ((<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/pure-rust-locales/pull/12\">chronotope/pure-rust-locales#12</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1420\">#1420</a>)</li>\n<li>Windows: base implementation on <code>GetTimeZoneInformationForYear</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1017\">#1017</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Additions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>TimeDelta::try_milliseconds</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1385\">#1385</a>, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/danwilliams\"><code>@\u200bdanwilliams</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Add <code>TimeDelta::new</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1337\">#1337</a>)</li>\n<li>Add <code>StrftimeItems::{parse, parse_to_owned}</code> and more documentation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1184\">#1184</a>)</li>\n<li>More standard traits and documentation for <code>format::Locale</code> (via <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/pure-rust-locales/pull/8\">chronotope/pure-rust-locales#8</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename <code>Duration</code> to <code>TimeDelta</code>, add type alias (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1406\">#1406</a>)</li>\n<li>Make <code>TimeDelta</code> methods const (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1337\">#1337</a>)</li>\n<li>Make remaining methods of <code>NaiveDate</code>, <code>NaiveWeek</code>, <code>NaiveTime</code> and <code>NaiveDateTime</code> const where possible (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1337\">#1337</a>)</li>\n<li>Make methods on <code>DateTime</code> const where possible (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1400\">#1400</a>)</li>\n<li>Make <code>Display</code> format of <code>TimeDelta</code> conform better to ISO 8601 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1328\">#1328</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Documentation</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix the formatting of <code>timestamp_micros</code>'s Example doc (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1338\">#1338</a> via <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1386\">#1386</a>, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/emikitas\"><code>@\u200bemikitas</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Specify branch for GitHub Actions badge and fix link (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1388\">#1388</a>)</li>\n<li>Don't mention some deprecated methods in docs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1395\">#1395</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove stray documentation from main (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1397\">#1397</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved documentation of <code>TimeDelta</code> constructors (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1385\">#1385</a>, thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/danwilliams\"><code>@\u200bdanwilliams</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Internal</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch branch names: 0.4.x releases are the <code>main</code> branch, work on 0.5 happens in the <code>0.5.x</code> branch (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1390\">#1390</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1402\">#1402</a>).</li>\n<li>Don't use deprecated method in <code>impl Arbitrary for DateTime</code> and set up CI test (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1336\">#1336</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove workaround for Rust &lt;

`tracing_context` field to Ockam messages:\r\n\r\n   - That field is serializes as a String [a propagated OpenTelemetry context ](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/context/api-propagators/).\r\n   - The field is read on the Elixir side when a message arrives and is used as the root of the trace which processes the message (same thing when an Elixir node sends a message to the Rust side).\r\n   - The similar field which was present on Request/Responses (one level above Ockam messages) is now removed.   \r\n\r\nOne scenario used to test this PR was the sending of an Ockam message to a background node. Here is an example of a trace: \r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/assets/10988/ae2c28a3-412a-4fab-a5f6-0881bbb9fbd3\">\r\n\r\nWhat we see is that:\r\n\r\n - The `Messages::send_message` function calls the `TcpSender` worker to send a message.\r\n - This message is received by the `TcpRcvProcessor` on the background node and forwarded to the `Echoer` service.\r\n - And the message is finally routed back to the caller.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to be able to serialize a proper tracing context in a `TransportMessage`. In order to do this, we need to solve 3 issues:\r\n\r\n 1. The `OpenTelemetryContext` must contain the current trace id and the _latest_ span id. \r\n 2. The tracing context must be preserved across async boundaries, for example between command invocation (synchronous) and command execution (asynchronous)\r\n 3. When we make a `LocalMessage` (for example containing a `Request`) we need to set the proper tracing context, _and make sure that this tracing context is staying up to date_ until we create a `TransportMessage`.\r\n\r\n### Correct `OpenTelemetry` context \r\n\r\nThis is not entirely obvious because of some discrepancies between the `tracing` crate and the `opentelemetry` crate(s). Please read the comments [here](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/4cd4f3a236a44b734b9ff52d14e793e0d69e5e9d/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_node/src/opentelemetry.rs#L35) for an explanation on how this was solved in a previous PR.\r\n\r\n### Passing the tracing context across async boundaries\r\n\r\nThis is solved by using the `with_context` function, for example [here](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7574/files#diff-721ad94ae6660f5847f6671ca3e9d1843cc9e9f804e41b6ebf4350c645990ddbR86).\r\n\r\nNote that we pass an `opentelemetry::Context` which is retrieved from the `OpenTelemetry::current()` function which makes sure that the last created span id is referenced.\r\n\r\nThere are currently other places in the code where `.with_context` is used, for example in `ockam_command/src/space/list.rs`. In this case we might not have the latest span id but this is not a problem since this code is called via the `embedded_node` function which sets the current context properly.\r\n\r\n### Passing the tracing context intra-node\r\n\r\nThere are 3 crucial places where the tracing context needs to be set and updated:\r\n\r\n - `LocalMessage::into_transport_message` when we create a `TransportMessage` from a `LocalMessage` containing the tracing context. Note that we call `local_message.tracing_context.update()` to make sure that the tracing context really contains the latest span id\r\n - `Context::send_from_address_impl`. This is where we create a `LocalMessage` when a worker sends a payload on a given route (the `.update()` method is also called here)\r\n - `WorkerRelay::recv_message`. Here we get the tracing context conveyed by the `LocalMessage` and:\r\n     - set it on the worker context\r\n     - use it (with `with_context) on the async call for `worker.handle_message` \r\n\r\nIf any of these things are missing then we are breaking traces.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have added 2 tests sending a \"hello\" message across 2 nodes, to and `Echoer` and back (with and without a secure channel).\r\n\r\nThese tests check that we end-up with one trace, showing spans from both nodes, in a correct parent/child relationship:\r\n```rust\r\nroot\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 create tcp transport\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 create tcp transport\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 TcpSendWorker::handle_message\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 TcpRecvProcessor::process\r\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Echoer::handle_message\r\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 TcpSendWorker::handle_message\r\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 TcpRecvProcessor::process\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese kind of tests have one drawback, they break if code is refactored, methods renamed etc... However without these tests it is very easy to break tracing and not realize it.\r\n\r\n## Additional implementations notes\r\n\r\n - The `OpenTelemetry` code has been moved to the `ockam_core` crate to be close to the Ockam message protocol.\r\n - A `Messages` interface has been refactored for both a `BackgroundNodeClient` and the `NodeManager` in order to instrument a span showing the invocation of the `send_message` function when running `ockam message send`\r\n - Similarly I extracted an `Outlets` trait to add a span for the outlet creation (this is [something that we needed to do anyway](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/issues/6698))\r\n \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7574/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7574/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7572", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7572/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7572/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/7572/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7572", "id": 2129774377, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCYdddc5mncJ9", "number": 7572, "title": "feat(rust): support policies for resource types", "user": {"login": "adrianbenavides", "id": 12375782, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzc1Nzgy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12375782?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides", "html_url": "https://github.com/adrianbenavides", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adrianbenavides/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-12T09:59:05Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-23T10:15:48Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-23T10:15:47Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/pulls/7572", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7572", "diff_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7572.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/7572.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-23T10:15:47Z"}, "body": "- Add support for global policies in the `policy create` command.
