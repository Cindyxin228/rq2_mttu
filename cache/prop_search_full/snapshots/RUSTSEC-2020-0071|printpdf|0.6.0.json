I changed the if statement so that it doesn't use the is_normal() function. Instead I check the output of the classify() function so that also zero numbers will accepted.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I created a macro \"impl_ord!\" that offers the functionalities of the ord trait. I would like to add that because I am trying to implement a table method for this library and I need for that a max and a min function for the Mm type. \r\n\r\nThirdly. I implemented Eq for Mm and Pt. This was required for the impl_ord Macro\r\n\r\nI already tested it with unit tests and it works.\r\n\r\nI would  really appreciate if you would merge it to the master branch so that everyone could benefit from the changes.\r\n\r\nIf you have any tips or ideas for me how I can contribute and help, please let me know.\r\n\r\nJulien\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

PDF generation library I found that supports custom fonts, unicode and SVG out of the box, but I was only missing annotations because I need to put links on my PDFs.\r\n\r\n2 hours ago I had no idea how PDF works internally, but looking at your code and the output from other PDF libraries I made a scape hatch to lopdf in the Page struct, so that it can be extended with arbitrary PDF dictionaries.\r\n\r\nI added a specific example adding a link to some text because from all the different types of annotations, I think links may be the most useful.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's something that can be kept around until there's a proper implementation for all the missing features, at which point people should stop using this error-prone variant and instead use specific functions that do the type checking.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fschutt/printpdf/issues/141/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
