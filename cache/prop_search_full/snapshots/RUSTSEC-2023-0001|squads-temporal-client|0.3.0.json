The custom one is essentially a copy-paste of Prom's own first-party lib, except with some modifications made to allow for the registration of metrics with overlapping labels (this is fully permitted by Prom for ingestion, mind you, just prevented client side. They have their reasons for that, which are legitimate, but taking that option away would require fully breaking our API).\r\n\r\n## Breaking\r\n* Metric `Arc<dyn XXX>` are now concrete types\r\n* `with_attributes` methods now return Results, just no good way around this. Dealing with it in lang bridges should be fairly easy though since the possibility of throwing something generally existed already.\r\n\r\n## New\r\n* All the metrics now have `adds` or `records` (as opposed to just `add`) which can be used (after `with_attributes`, typically) to record without passing labels again. This is more efficient for the prom backend. They needed a different name to avoid turbofish disambiguation nonsense.\r\n\r\nI did some testing to ensure performance isn't materially different here, and it's not in real-world situations (ex: the `workflow_load` integration test has no difference in overall runtime). That said, the specific bench I made does show that if you record a bajillion prom metrics as fast as you can from different threads, lock contention slows things down by as much as 50%. At the same time, OTel's implementation of what actually happens when you scrape prom metrics is to just basically create every single metric on demand from scratch and fill in the data, which is definitely slower than what happens now - so actual scraping should be quite a bit cheaper. TLDR: I don't have any reason to believe this would have any real impact, for anyone unless they're using custom metrics with the prom exporter and are just absolutely hammering away.\r\n\r\nIf further perf improvements are desired in the future, we could add a `bind_with_schema` kind of API which would bind a metric to a certain set of labels, and allow recording on that metric with different label values without going through a lock.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/908\r\nCloses https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/882", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/942/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/942/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/931", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/931/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/931/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/931/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/931", "id": 3124551658, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6ZYS50", "number": 931, "title": "Base environment configuration module", "user": {"login": "THardy98", "id": 15315413, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzE1NDEz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15315413?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98", "html_url": "https://github.com/THardy98", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/THardy98/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-06-06T11:50:50Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-09T21:43:42Z", "closed_at": "2025-06-09T21:43:40Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/931", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/931", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/931.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/931.patch", "merged_at": "2025-06-09T21:43:40Z"}, "body": "## What was changed\r\nAdded `envconfig.rs`, a Rust port of the Go `envconfig` module.

The `ansi` feature was explicitly listed because it's used in the code.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nI am trying to use `core` crate from Temporal SDK in a Rust application that already uses `tracing-subscriber`. However, it fails to initialize the subscriber because `core` depends on `tracing-subscriber` with `tracing-log` feature enabled. This behavior is documented [here](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/util/trait.SubscriberInitExt.html#method.try_init):\r\n\r\n> This method panics if a global default subscriber has already been set, or if a log logger has already been set (when the \u201ctracing-log\u201d feature is enabled).\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, `core` would not depend on `tracing-subscribers` since it is a [library](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing?tab=readme-ov-file#in-libraries), but I propose this as an immediate fix.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/877/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/877/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/874", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/874/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/874/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/874/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/874", "id": 2839396609, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6KfEfz", "number": 874, "title": "Poller scaling", "user": {"login": "Sushisource", "id": 517683, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzY4Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/517683?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource", "html_url": "https://github.com/Sushisource", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-02-08T01:51:22Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-02T17:06:58Z", "closed_at": "2025-04-02T17:06:57Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/874", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/874", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/874.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/874.patch", "merged_at": "2025-04-02T17:06:57Z"}, "body": "I intend to add a few unit tests too, and some simpler integ tests once server is actually released with this.

Updated otel-collector-*.yaml to stop using deprecated field, see #854.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n<!-- Tell your future self why have you made these changes -->\r\nUsers have requested HTTP support, on top of existing GRPC support\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- add/delete as needed --->\r\n\r\n1.
