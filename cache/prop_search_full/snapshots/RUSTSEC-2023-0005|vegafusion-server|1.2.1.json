"2023-03-15T14:16:40Z"}, "body": "## Overview\r\nThis PR introduces the ability to define SQL connections in Python. To prove out the idea, a Python DuckDB connection is implemented.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n### Python SqlConnection\r\nAn `SqlConnection` Python abstract class is defined in `python/vegafusion/vegafusion/connection/__init__.py`. Subclasses are required to implement three methods:\r\n - `tables(self) -> Dict[str, pa.Schema]` to return a dict from registered table names to pyarrow schemas.\r\n - `dialect(cls) -> str` to return the name of the SQL dialect that the connection expects. These correspond to the dialects defined in the `vegafusion-sql` crate.\r\n - `fetch_query(self, query: str, schema: pa.Schema) -> pa.Table` to evaluate the requested SQL query and return the result as a pyarrow Table.  The requested query may reference named tables returned by the `tables` method. The expected result schema is provided.\r\n\r\nSQL connections to read-only databases would typically implement only these three methods (Though we don't have an example of this yet).  Additional optional methods may be overridden by connections (like duckdb) that support dynamic registration of tables from in-memory data structures.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n - `register_arrow(self, name: str, table: pa.Table, temporary: bool = False)` may be implemented to support the dynamic registration of a pyarrow Table for use in `fetch_query`. \r\n\r\nIn `vegafusion-python-embed/src/connection.rs`, a Rust `PySqlConnection` struct is defined that implements the Rust `Connection` and `SqlConnection` traits. `PySqlConnection` wraps a Python object (through PyO3) that is a subclass of the Python `SqlConnection` abstract class.\r\n\r\n### Fallback\r\nPython SQL connections may optionally declare that they should fall back to the built-in DataFusion connection when SQL is encountered that is not supported by the connection's dialect. Fallback defaults to True.\r\n\r\n### Multi-threading\r\nTo work around deadlocking the Python interpreter, it was necessary to configure the tokio runtime in single-threaded mode when a Python SqlConnection is registered with the VegaFusion runtime.  We still use a multi-threaded tokio runtime for the pure Rust DataFusion connection.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nHere is an example of using the DuckDB connection from Python\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport vegafusion as vf\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nvf.runtime.set_connection(\"duckdb\")\r\nvf.enable()\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport altair as alt\r\n\r\nflights = pd.read_parquet(\r\n    \"https://vegafusion-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/vega/flights_1m.parquet\"\r\n)\r\n\r\ndelay_hist = alt.Chart(flights).mark_bar().encode(\r\n    alt.X(\"delay\", bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),\r\n    alt.Y(\"count()\")\r\n)\r\ndelay_hist\r\n```\r\n![visualization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15064365/225320926-00182080-b402-4f44-974c-c7fa480623e8.png)\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nMost significant benefit of the DuckDB connection is its ability to bind tables directly to Pandas DataFrames without serialization to arrow.  This results in significant speedups with the mime renderer and the `vf.transformed_data` function. I have not seen much benefit in the widget renderer, since in this case the DataFrame is always serialized to arrow and written to disk.  In this case, my anecdotal observation is that the DuckDB and DataFusion connections have very similar performance.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the speedup when calling `transformed_data` on a histogram chart of a 1 million row movies dataset.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport vegafusion as vf\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport altair as alt\r\n\r\n# Load large movies dataset\r\nsource = \"https://vegafusion-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/vega/movies_1m.parquet\"\r\nmovies = pd.read_parquet(source)\r\n\r\nchart = alt.Chart(movies).mark_bar().encode(\r\n    alt.X(\"IMDB_Rating\", bin=True),\r\n    alt.Y(\"count()\")\r\n)\r\n``` \r\nFirst with the DataFusion connection\r\n```\r\nvf.runtime.set_connection(\"datafusion\")\r\n%time vf.transformed_data(chart)\r\n```\r\n```\r\nCPU times: user 656 ms, sys: 136 ms, total: 792 ms\r\nWall time: 731 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow with the DuckDB connection\r\n```python\r\nvf.runtime.set_connection(\"duckdb\")\r\n%time vf.transformed_data(chart)\r\n```\r\n```\r\nCPU times: user 265 ms, sys: 8.81 ms, total: 274 ms\r\nWall time: 62.5 ms\r\n```\r\nOver 10x faster! \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\nThe DuckDB connection does have some limitations\r\n\r\n - The DuckDB CSV reader sometimes has trouble loading CSV files from the jsdelivr URLs in the vega datases package. Sometimes it results in an error complaining that the response does not include Content Length. It's working on the moment so I don't have the exact error at hand. This PR changes some of these URLs to equivalent URLs that pull files from GitHub where there is no issue.\r\n - DuckDB doesn't have a function to automatically parse a wide variety of timestamp formats. Vega relies on the browser's `Date` class to parse a variety of date formats, and DataFusion defines a custom UDF to match this behavior. Because of this, the DuckDB connection will fail with date parsing errors when non ISO-8601 timestamp strings are used as timestamps.\r\n - Relatedly, DataFusion follows an idiosyncrasy of the browser's timestamp parsing logic. timestamp strings are always parsed in the local timezone unless they are of the form YYYY-MM-DD, in which case they are parsed in UTC. The DuckDB connection will consistently parse all supported timestamp strings in the local timezone. \r\n\r\nNone of these limitations are relevant when using a Pandas DataFrame as the data source for a chart (as long as timestamp strings are already converted to timestamps), but they come up when loading data from external URLs, as is the case in a lot of the Altair gallery examples.  This is why I don't foresee changing the default connection to DuckDB in the near future.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/249/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Here are the new crates:\r\n\r\n## Crates \r\n\r\n### vegafusion-common\r\nA subset of the functionality of `vegafusion-core` was extracted into `vegafusion-common`. This includes the error struct and base data structures. This is now a dependency of `vegafusion-core` and the new `vegafusion-dataframe` crates.\r\n\r\n### vegafusion-dataframe\r\nThe `DataFrame` and `Connection` traits have been pulled out into a `vegafusion-dataframe` crate.  This is used as the dependency of `vegafusion-runtime`, this way there is no hard dependency on `SqlDataFrame` and `SqlConnection`.\r\n\r\n### vegafusion-sql\r\nThis crate provides the `SqlConnection` and `SqlDataFrame` structs with implement the `Connection` and `DataFrame` traits from the `vegafusion-dataframe` crate using SQL.  The functionality for generating SQL string across dialects is always available in the crate. Optional support for evaluating the queries is enabled by feature flags with a `-conn` suffix.\r\n\r\nThe `datafusion-conn` and `sqlite-conn` feature flags are currently supported.\r\n\r\n### vegafusion-datafusion-udfs\r\nThis crate contains the definitions of the DataFusion UDFs that are used to implement select Vega expression functions and transforms. These UDFs are used in two places.\r\n - The `DataFusionConnection` provided by `vegafusion-sql` adds these UDFs to its `SessionContext` so that they are available for use in SQL querires.\r\n - The `vegafusion-runtime` crate uses these UDFs for the evaluation of signal expressions and for simplifying expressions passed to the `filter` and `formula` transforms. Note: Even when a non-DataFusion Connection is used, DataFusion is still used for signal evaluation and expression simplification.\r\n\r\n### vegafusion-runtime\r\nThis crate was renamed from `vegafusion-rt-datafusion` to `vegafusion-runtime`.  Along with this, the `TaskGraphRuntime`  struct was renamed to `VegaFusionRuntime`.\r\n\r\n### Other refactoring\r\nThe `VegaFusionRuntime` struct now accepts a `Arc<dyn Connection>` in the constructor. This defines the connection that the runtime uses by default. Currently `vegafusion-python-embed` sets this to `DataFusionConnection`.\r\n\r\nThis change made it possible to remove the dependency on `datafusion-core` from `vegafusion-runtime`.  Now, the only time we depend on all of datafusion is when the `datafusion-conn` feature flag is enabled on the `vegafusion-sql` crate.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis work lays the foundation for several exciting possibilities:\r\n\r\n - Non-datafusion SQL dialects and execution connections can be added to `vegafusion-sql`, and then used in `vegafusion-runtime` with no changes to that crate.\r\n - vegafusion-runtime should now compile to WASM (since there is no top-level datafusion dependency, which was a difficulty in the past). Once the DuckDB SQL dialect is supported, it should be possible to compile the runtime to WASM and use DuckDB WASM for execution.\r\n - Non-SQL implementations of the `DataFrame` and `Connection` traits can be developed. e.g. `vegafusion-polars`, `vegafusion-substrait`, etc.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/241/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/241/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/239", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/239/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/239/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/239/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/239", "id": 1566845757, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGJTEcc5JC_aP", "number": 239, "title": "SQL refactoring", "user": {"login": "jonmmease", "id": 15064365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDY0MzY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15064365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonmmease", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-02-01T21:17:24Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-02T12:37:16Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-02T12:37:15Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/pulls/239", "html_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/239", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/239.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/239.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-02T12:37:15Z"}, "body": "## Overview\r\nThis PR includes various refactors that are important foundations for later adding support for evaluating VegaFusion's implementation of Vega transforms on alternative (other than DataFusion) execution backends.\r\n\r\nThis PR should result in no changes to VegaFusion's behavior, public interfaces, or crate layout.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nCommits [81c0fc0](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/81c0fc0c9d74bb0e79786916d312420274ab03b1), [4625877](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/46258772fdd5ce03fb2a1b45962c0bc9f14d3c25), [11e8a52](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/11e8a52cbc8fd0d0b653955a1a50468a779cecf0), [23dde46](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/23dde46d30f069639a7ef9ea96ce608347df03fe), [ab4b320](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/ab4b3203c3d1238a4215e0188127d5768852cfc8), [ab4b320](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/ab4b3203c3d1238a4215e0188127d5768852cfc8) and [6b89419](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/6b89419b1319d070c106b8ca54d9ee917990cb3d) move all of the direct SQL string manipulation logic out of the transform implementations and into `SqlDataFrame` methods. This results in the creation of three new `SqlDataFrame` methods: `fold`, `impute`, and `joinaggregate`.  The `chain_query_*` methods can then be made private. The result is that transform implementations only deal with DataFusion expressions and the `SqlDataFrame` interface. They no longer care about the dialect of SQL that's used (or whether SQL is used at all) to evaluate these data frame methods.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the schema of an `SqlDataFrame` was computed by converting the data frame's SQL into DataFusion's dialect of SQL and then using DataFusion to infer the result type of the query.  This resulted in a dependency on DataFusion's SQL dialect.  Commit [f738fc9](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/f738fc9c9de763919fb5d8a5e283916e29f4021b) removes the dependency by manually propagating the SqlDataFrame's schema all of it's methods.  This opens the door to having SqlDataFrame generate dialect dependent SQL.\r\n\r\n[70cca4b](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/70cca4b3a9886af71fd054fcb16694a45257222a) extracts the `SqlDataFrame` methods required by the VegaFusion transform implementation into a new `DataFusion` trait.  The transform implementations now input and output `Arc<dyn DataFrame>` instances rather than `&SqlDataFrame` instances.  `SqlDataFrame` is currently the only implementation of this trait, but this refactor opens the door to supporting non-SQL backends (e.g. like [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)) in the future.\r\n\r\n[383b571](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/383b5712bf970fbd979c79e9ae90bf46b796b8ce) extracts a `Connection` trait from the `SqlConnection` struct. The `DataFrame` trait now has an associated `Connection` trait.  The existing logic creating `SqlDataFrame` instances from CSV files and `VegaFusionTable` instances is moved into methods on the `Connection` trait. the `DataFusionConnection` struct implements both `Connection` and `SqlConnection`.  This opens the door for using other execution backends for csv parsing and for initializing DataFrame's from inline datasets.\r\n\r\n[855224a](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/855224a2313b1be80415a83029e458f5ba84c510) adds a top-level `Connection` instance to the `TaskGraphRuntime`.  Right now this value is hard-coded to an instance of `DataFusionConnection`, but eventually we'll make this connection configurable.\r\n\r\nFinally, [44f5c5f](https://github.com/hex-inc/vegafusion/pull/239/commits/44f5c5f5fd5b79dff9b3dc3bd42125c066e8f9b6) removes the dependency on sqlgen.  `sqlgen` is a fork of sqlparser-rs I was experimenting with. My prior plan was to have VegaFusion generate a simple dialect of SQL. sqlgen would parse this simple dialect and then translate it to other dialects.  This has proven to be a much more complex problem than having the `SqlDataFrame` methods generate dialect-specialized SQL directly. This commit replaces `sqlgen` with the upstream `sqlparser-rs` crate. A `Dialect` configuration struct is added that specializes the translation of DataFusion expressions to SqlParser AST nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n", "reactions": {"url":

It also works around the DataFusion error reported in https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/5034.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nVega's implementation of `distinct` considers NULL to be a distinct value whereas SQL ignores NULL values before counting distinct values. To align our implementation with Vega's, 40098407a361902636c52ba33330dd1a86695c2b updates the `distinct` aggregation function to add one if the column contains any NULL values.  \r\n\r\nd876d0b19057bc12c048450ca250c9248529a1e2 and e13402cf8782d1a01c98fb1041fd598c7389ab84 update DataFusion to 16.1.0 with backports as described in https://github.com/jonmmease/arrow-datafusion/pull/139.\r\n\r\n455201fd830c50fb862ab9ed2fcfc7b118fa376d Adds a custom spec that previously triggers the error reported in https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/5034.\r\n\r\n3fd34c62249909ffb6d23533fd3b899385bbb617 makes two updates to the pivot transform:\r\n 1. The implementation no longer performs a join per pivoted value and instead uses SQL `CASE` statements inside the aggregation functions to filter down to the values the pivot value.  This avoids https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/5034, and should improve performance for pivots that introduce many columns as we're no longer performing a join per added column.\r\n 2. If the pivoted column includes NULL values, then a column named \"null\" will be generated. This. matches Vega. There was some additional work required to make sure the NULL column sorts as the first column for the purpose of limiting.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/234/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/234/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/233", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/233/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/233/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/issues/233/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/233", "id": 1551929996, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGJTEcc5IRJki", "number": 233, "title": "1.0.1 Fixes", "user": {"login": "jonmmease", "id": 15064365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDY0MzY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15064365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonmmease", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonmmease/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-01-21T22:36:14Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-22T19:25:32Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-22T19:25:31Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vega/vegafusion/pulls/233", "html_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/233", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/233.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vega/vegafusion/pull/233.patch", "merged_at": "2023-01-22T19:25:31Z"}, "body": "A few fixes for 1.0.1. The [conda package build](https://github.com/conda-forge/vegafusion-python-embed-feedstock/pull/22#issuecomment-1399470649) uncovered a few things:\r\n\r\n - For some reason, [protobuf-src](https://crates.io/crates/protobuf-src) isn't building successfully with conda-build.  We had configured things to always get protoc from `protobuf-src` on Mac/Linux, and rely on an external protoc install on Windows. This PR adds a `--features=protobuf-src` flag to all of the packages to configure whether to build protoc from source or rely on an external installation. All of the GitHub actions CI jobs set `protobuf-src` for Mac/Linux, but for the conda build we'll rely on the `protobuf` conda package.\r\n - It seems the top-level `[patch.crates-io]` configuration isn't applied when the `vegafusion-python-embed` is rebuilt from the sdist package.  So this PR moves the specification of the DataFusion branch to the dependency locations.\r\n- Altair imports are updated based on suggestions from @binste in
