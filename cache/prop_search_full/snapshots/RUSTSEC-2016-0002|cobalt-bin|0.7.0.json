field in `.cobalt.yml` is changing from a list of glob patterns to\r\na list `gitignore` patterns, allowing whitelisting and more advanced\r\nwhitelisting/blacklisting with well defined semantics.\r\n\r\nPreviuously, Cobalt processed all files except `.dot` and `_hidden`,\r\n*dest* files/directories.\r\n\r\nConsiderations when designing this:\r\n- User workflow: users need `.dot` asset files, like `.htaccess`, copied over.\r\n- Implementation: Finding files for pages and posts is coupled together\r\n  which will be a problem as we refactor them into more general\r\n  collections or sections.\r\n- Performance: Eventually we'll want to implement incremental rebuild\r\n  (see issue #81) and to do so we'll need to know what collection a file\r\n  notification is relevant to.\r\n\r\n`gitignore` patterns were selected for the first item to ensure we had\r\nwell defined semantics for how blacklist and whitelist features would\r\ninteract, directory vs file patterns, etc.\r\n\r\nThe last two are the motivation for factoring out file detection.\r\n\r\nA couple downsides, for now\r\n- `cobalt watch` will now rebuild when hidden files are touched.  This is\r\n  unfortunate but seems like an acceptable short term sacrifice until we\r\n  have a better to expose what files cobal reads.\r\n- Handling of overlapping source/dest is a bit ugly. In the future, we\r\n  should just make these cases error\r\n- Handling of hidden post folders is ugly.  In the future, we should\r\n  generalize the concept of pages and posts into collections/sections at\r\n  which point we'll walk each collection type independently.  This will\r\n  make the non-hidden posts folders the ugly case.  We should consider\r\n  requiring them to be hidden.\r\n- There is a known bug where we enable all hidden folders that match the\r\n  posts folders name rather than only some.\r\n\r\nFixes #221 by allowing the user to whitelist `.dot` and `_hidden` files.\r\nSee the added unit tests for examples.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: The format of `.cobalt.yml`'s `ignore` field has changed\r\nfrom a list of glob patterns to gitignore patterns.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/227/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

attributes \"title\", \"slug\", and \"ext\" if needed based on the\r\ninput-file.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this change is to allow a custom \"path\" while\r\nretaining the original :slug. A more surgical approach was taken rather\r\nthan trying to achieve 100% Jekyll-compatibility though Jekyll does serve\r\nas an inspiration for how these features work.\r\n\r\nThe \"slug\" attribute defaults to a lower-case slugified version of the\r\ndocument's filename.  The primary use is for specifying a custom \"path\"\r\nattribute that still includes the original file name (via :slug).\r\n\r\nJekyll compatibility:\r\n- Precedence: Allows a user to override \"slug\" in their front matter.\r\n- Template variable for path: The default slug attempts to be formatted\r\n  like Jekyll\r\nJekyll incompatibility:\r\n- General: Jekyll excludes \"YYYY-MM-DD-\" from the slug. Cobalt would need\r\n  additional work done to make \"date\" more Jekyll compatible before this\r\n  is worth implementing.\r\n- Template variable for path: An overridden slug is not slugified in\r\n  Cobalt. This is in part for simplicity and in part trusting the user.\r\n- Attribute: Jekyll does not sluggify the attribute but instead expects\r\n  the user to slugify it with a filter.\r\n\r\nThe \"title\" attribute is now defaulted to a title-cased, slugified version\r\nof the document's filename. The primary use is to minimize user's having\r\nto repeat themselves in their liquid document.\r\n\r\nJekyll compatibility:\r\n- Precedence: Allows a user to override \"title\" in their front matter.\r\n  Does not use the overridden \"slug\" attribute if provided.\r\nJekyll incompatibility:\r\n- General: Jekyll excludes \"YYYY-MM-DD-\" from the title.\r\n- Template variable for path: :title is supposed to be a \"pretty\" mixed\r\n  case version of :slug\r\n- Attribute: Jekyll does not slugify the file name before title-casing it.\r\n\r\nThe \"ext\" attribute defaults to the file extension of the liquid document\r\n(\"md\", \"liquid\", etc)\r\n\r\nJekyll compatibility:\r\n- Precedence: Allows a user to override \"ext\" in their front matter.\r\nJekyll incompatibility:\r\n- Attribute: Jekyll includes the \".\".\r\n\r\nThe :name template variable for path (slugified file_stem, not overriding\r\nallowed) was also going to be added but for some reason it caused a test\r\nto fail. Since it wasn't needed for the primary purpose of this change, it\r\nwas skipped rather than time being spent on investigating the failure.", "reactions": {"url":

meta-data\n\nThis is something I've been meaning to do for a long time now.\n\nI would like to add consistency in how we deal with files and folders\nthat have a leading dot or underscore. This commit makes it so that both\nkinds are simply ignored by default when looking for documents to\ngenerate or assets to copy. I like to see those filenames as\nindication that the folders contain \"meta\" information.\n\nMy idea of a good site generator is that your source file structure is\nnot fundamentally different from the resulting file structure. You\nbasically end up with the same structure but \"enhanced\" by the site\ngenerator (e.g. by turning .md and .liquid files into .html files).\nIt is very useful to have an easy indicator like an underscore to show\nthat this file will be used in the generation process but will not be\nthere in the resulting site. You can now simply have a file called _data.json\nnext to your template or blog file.\n\nThe default post path has been changed to \"posts\".\nFor compatibility it is still possible to set your default post path to\n\"_posts\", however, you now have to do it explicitly in your .cobalt.yml.\n\nThis is good, as having _posts/blog-post.md generate to\n_posts/blog-post.html was just laughable.\n\nI will make PRs for that in all affected user pages.\n(Most of them already specify a different posts directory, so nothing should change).\n\n_layouts obviously stays the same. I changed the layout handling a\nbit, though. Layouts are now read from disk every time they are\nrequired. This needs a bit of optmization in the future but allows for\nbetter and more flexible layout specification.\n\nFurthermore, users can now specify a `post_path` in their .cobalt.yml, which is the global\nfallback for the `path` attribute in post front matter (called permalink in Jekyll). I feel like these\ntwo changes finally give us both an easy but also flexible post writing experience.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/119/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/119/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/113", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/113/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/113/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/issues/113/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/113", "id": 159045505, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzI5NjM4MDg=", "number": 113, "title": "Move from Nickel to Hyper", "user": {"login": "DonRyuDragoni", "id": 4451827, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE4Mjc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4451827?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni", "html_url": "https://github.com/DonRyuDragoni", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DonRyuDragoni/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 9, "created_at": "2016-06-07T23:12:57Z", "updated_at": "2016-06-10T16:55:04Z", "closed_at": "2016-06-10T07:39:28Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pulls/113", "html_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/113", "diff_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/113.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs/pull/113.patch", "merged_at": "2016-06-10T07:39:28Z"}, "body": "As proposed in #109, I moved all Nickel-related code to Hyper.
