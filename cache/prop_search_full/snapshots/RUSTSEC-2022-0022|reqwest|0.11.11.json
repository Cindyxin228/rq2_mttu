The new variant allows `Body.to_js_value` to have dedicated codepaths for standalone bodies and form parts. The new variant is contructed by the new `Body.into_part` method. That method is called by the `crate::wasm::multipart::Part::new` constructor and turns an Inner::Body into the new Inner::MultipartPart variant.\r\n\r\nThe drawback is that the new variant leads to some code duplication in the `Body` methods where it mostly shares code with the `Inner::Bytes` variant.\r\n\r\nFor clarity the PR renames the `Inner::Multipart` variant to `Inner::MultipartForm`. It also adds new test cases to cover the serialization of different bodies either standalone or multipart.\r\n\r\nThanks to @crapStone for pointing at the `Inner` enum in #1358 and @skystar-p for the original mutlipart conversion code in #1341.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1364/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1364/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1360", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1360/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1360/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1360/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1360", "id": 1029476185, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA7dkLM4tWFFH", "number": 1360, "title": "Body from tokio::fs::File", "user": {"login": "fredr", "id": 762956, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mjk1Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/762956?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr", "html_url": "https://github.com/fredr", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fredr/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-10-18T18:52:57Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-22T07:36:41Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-21T22:23:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/pulls/1360", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1360", "diff_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1360.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1360.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-21T22:23:17Z"}, "body": "Was it something like this you had in mind @seanmonstar ?
