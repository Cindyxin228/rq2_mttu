Viceroy to using rustls for TLS, with some good benefits.

The main downside is that there's a bit of boilerplate around TCP/TLS streams.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, this PR also refactors the CLI backend health checks to use the Viceroy library, rather than connecting in its own way, which will help ensure we keep those in sync.\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that this PR:\r\n\r\nFixes #91 \r\nFixes #96", "reactions": {"url":
