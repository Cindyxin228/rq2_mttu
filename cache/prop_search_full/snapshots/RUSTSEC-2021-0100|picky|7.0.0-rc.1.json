Decoding and encoding _SSH public_, private keys, and _SSH_ certificates.\r\n2. Generating _SSH_ private key and _SSH_ certificate.\r\n3. _SSH_ certificate authority in **picky-server**. \r\n**picky-server** can now issue an _SSH_ certificate by signing an _SSH_ public key. _SSH_ public keys are divided into host and client based on how the final certificate is intended to be used in an _SSH_ certificate authentication. **picky-server** contains the host and client _SSH_ private keys for signing a host public and a client public keys respective. **picky-server** private keys are stored encrypted into a **PickyStorage**. The keys are encrypted with a password that an admin can specify through _CLI_ arguments or defaults in use. I added regenerating an _SSH_ private key if a password does not match, with that password. **picky-server** new the following _REST_ endpoints:\r\n- `/ssh/sign_key` - signs an incoming _SSH_ public key. It expects _JWT_ encoded _SshSignRequest_(you can see in code how it looks like :slightly_smiling_face:) and responses with an _SSH_ certificate. \r\n- `/ssh/client_ssh_key` - responses with the public key of the client private key.\r\n- `/ssh/host_ssh_key` - responses with the public key of the host private key.\r\n\r\nYou might find the following resources useful for reviewing:\r\n[_SSH_
