`chompfile.toml` are now `kebab-case` per convention.\r\n* `[task.args]` for setting template options has been renamed to `[task.template-opts]` to make it clearer what this is doing.\r\n* A new `[default-template-opts.template-name]` top-level setting is now provided for setting default options by template. Resolves https://github.com/guybedford/chomp/issues/27.\r\n* `autoInstall` is now `auto-install`, and `PKG_MANAGER` is no longer an environment variable but rather a template option `pkg-manager`\r\n* The `jspm:generate` template is renamed to just `jspm`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adopts a manual chaining of template options within the template definitions themselves, although that is mostly an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes various template fixes including fixing https://github.com/guybedford/chomp/issues/29 and some normalization in the JSPM generator and Babel plugins.\r\n\r\nTLDR; here's a before after configuration example:\r\n\r\nBEFORE:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nversion = 0.1\r\n\r\n[env]\r\n  PKG_MANAGER = \"pnpm\"\r\n\r\n[[task]]\r\n  template = \"jspm\"\r\n  [task.args]\r\n    autoInstall = true\r\n    env = [\"browser\", \"production\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nversion = 0.1\r\n\r\n[default-template-opts.npm]\r\n  auto-install = true\r\n  pkg-manager = 'pnpm'\r\n\r\n[[task]]\r\n  template = \"jspm\"\r\n  [task.template-opts]\r\n    env = [\"browser\", \"production\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is strictly a breaking change, since no release has yet been made there is no version bump.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/guybedford/chomp/issues/31/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,
