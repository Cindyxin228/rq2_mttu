Almost all flags have been renamed/moved and will require callers to update. The main motivation here is to cut down on the forest of options in `wasmtime -h` which are difficult to mentally group together and understand.\r\n\r\nThe main change implemented here is to move options behind \"option groups\" which are intended to be abbreviated with a single letter:\r\n\r\n* `-O foo` - an optimization or performance-tuning related option\r\n* `-C foo` - a codegen option affecting the compilation process.\r\n* `-D foo` - a debug-related option\r\n* `-W foo` - a wasm-related option, for example changing wasm semantics\r\n* `-S foo` - a WASI-related option, configuring various proposals for example\r\n\r\nEach option group can be explored by passing `help`, for example `-O help`. This will print all options within the group along with their help message. Additionally `-O help-long` can be passed to print the full comment for each option if desired.\r\n\r\nOption groups can be specified multiple times on the command line, for example `-Wrelaxed-simd -Wthreads`. They can also be combined together with commas as `-Wrelaxed-simd,threads`. Configuration works as a \"last option wins\" so `-Ccache,cache=n` would end up with a compilation cache disabled.\r\n\r\nBoolean options can be specified as `-C foo` to enable `foo`, or they can be specified with `-Cfoo=$val` with any of `y`, `n`, `yes`, `no`, `true`, or `false`. All other options require a `=foo` value to be passed and the parsing depends on the type.\r\n\r\nThis commit additionally applies a few small refactorings to the CLI as well. For example the help text no longer prints information about wasm features after printing the option help. This is still available via `-Whelp` as all wasm features have moved from `--wasm-features` to `-W`. Additionally flags are no longer conditionally compiled in, but instead all flags are always supported. A runtime error is returned if support for a flag is not compiled in. Additionally the \"experimental\" name of WASI proposals has been dropped in favor of just the name of the proposal, for example `--wasi nn` instead of `--wasi-modules experimental-wasi-nn`. This is intended to mirror how wasm proposals don't have \"experimental\" in the name and an opt-in is required regardless.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Full listing of flags and how they have
