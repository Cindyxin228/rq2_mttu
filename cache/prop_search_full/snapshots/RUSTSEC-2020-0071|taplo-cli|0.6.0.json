When I originally wrote most of it, I barely had time and just wanted to get features out ASAP.\r\n\r\nThe [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) has recently passed the 100K installs mark, I felt that some cleanup and care was long overdue.\r\n\r\nThis PR is pretty much a rewrite and/or a major refactor of Taplo with the only exception of the parser, which I would love to rewrite as well but I'm already pushing my time-limits.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- [x] Rewrite of the DOM, it now uses a reference-counted implementation where each node is cheap to clone and to juggle around.\r\n- [x] Rewrite of the CLI as well, it is now a first-class citizen not just something quickly thrown together.\r\n- [x] Integration of [jsonschema](https://github.com/Stranger6667/jsonschema-rs), most (all?) JSON Schema features are now supported and the limitations of the current implementation are non-existent.\r\n- [x] Support of [schema store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) catalog and schemas\r\n- [x] The shared code between the CLI and the language server is now properly extracted into `taplo-common`, so the CLI and the LSP are no longer out of sync.\r\n- [x] The external environment is now abstracted away into a trait, so both the LSP and the CLI should run pretty much anywhere with minimal plumbing\r\n- [x] [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) is used for all logging\r\n- [x] Refactor and workspace support in the LSP\r\n- [x] All [toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test) tests now pass\r\n- [x] Proper benchmarks via criterion (the new DOM is slightly slower initially due to allocations, but not too much)\r\n- [x] Completions and hover in the LSP (the building blocks are there, but the cursor queries require some plumbing)\r\n- [ ] The LSP is part of the CLI as well, and the VSCode extension works with it, WASM bindings are yet to be reimplemented\r\n- [x] Flexible configuration options in the LSP\r\n- [x] Proper directives in TOML files (e.g. schema)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nProbably a lot, but here are a few notable ones:\r\n\r\n- The DOM API is completely different, although migration should be rather easy.\r\n- Chrono feature has been removed, it can be reintroduced later though if needed.\r\n- As with the DOM layout, error types have also changed.\r\n- Date types are now separate syntax-kinds.\r\n- Even though we had no MSRV policy, I clearly used 1.58 features during the rewrite\r\n- The Even Better Toml vscode extension also gets a facelift with some configuration options changed\r\n\r\nMerging

Thanks for this crate! I've been investigating a bunch of TOML parsers and found yours to be the best out of all the ones I tried.

I think though that eventually it should be flipped so that using wasm-bindgen is opt-in rather than opt-out.\r\n\r\nThanks! (Also, I've used the parser to create a code formatter...

schemas\r\n- [x] The shared code between the CLI and the language server is now properly extracted into `taplo-common`, so the CLI and the LSP are no longer out of sync.\r\n- [x] The external environment is now abstracted away into a trait, so both the LSP and the CLI should run pretty much anywhere with minimal plumbing\r\n- [x] [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) is used for all logging\r\n- [x] Refactor and workspace support in the LSP\r\n- [x] All [toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test) tests now pass\r\n- [x] Proper benchmarks via criterion (the new DOM is slightly slower initially due to allocations, but not too much)\r\n- [x] Completions and hover in the LSP (the building blocks are there, but the cursor queries require some plumbing)\r\n- [ ] The LSP is part of the CLI as well, and the VSCode extension works with it, WASM bindings are yet to be reimplemented\r\n- [x] Flexible configuration options in the LSP\r\n- [x] Proper directives in TOML files (e.g. schema)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nProbably a lot, but here are a few notable ones:\r\n\r\n- The DOM API is completely different, although migration should be rather easy.\r\n- Chrono feature has been removed, it can be reintroduced later though if needed.\r\n- As with the DOM layout, error types have also changed.\r\n- Date types are now separate syntax-kinds.\r\n- Even though we had no MSRV policy, I clearly used 1.58 features during the rewrite\r\n- The Even Better Toml vscode extension also gets a facelift with some configuration options changed\r\n\r\nMerging
