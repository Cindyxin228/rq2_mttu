This updates `wasmparser` across the \"great module linking removal\" which necessitated deleting a lot more code in wizer related to module linking. To the best of my knowledge that's in line with the original intention of https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer/pull/65 so I'm hoping it's ok. \r\n\r\nI'll note that I applied a mostly hack-and-slash approach to deleting module-linking code.
