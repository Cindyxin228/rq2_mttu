with an `allowed_purposes` parameter that may specify the BIP 77 mailbox as a specific service.\r\n\r\nThis was activated by implementing probing functionality that caches `allowed_purposes` responses

performing a `GET /.well-known/ohttp-relay?allowed_purposes`. If the response is an `application/x-ohttp-allowed-purposes`, which is a list of values encoded as in TLS ALPN (U16BE for number of elements, U8 length prefix for each binary string value), and this is found to contain the magic string `BIP77 454403bb-9f7b-4385-b31f-acd2dae20b7e`, then the gateway is considered to have opted in to receiving OHTTP requests for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAlthough appropriate in principle, the `Cache-Control` and/or `Retry-After` headers given by the (potential/alleged) gateways are not taken into consideration as no such functionality exists in the payjoin directory's OHTTP gateway implementation, and such functionality would require parsing logic (a crate exists for this FWIW).\r\n\r\nWhen the prober is over capacity (too many cached or inflight gateway probes), a `Cache-Control max-age=...` header is provided for the 503 Service Unavailable response, with the TTL of the earliest expiring entry.\r\n\r\nOther negative responses do not set `Cache-Control`, doing so would require a second `Error::NotFound` variant or some other way of setting that, this doesn't really seem useful for clients or service operators, so that is also omitted for simplicity.\r\n\r\nThis should probably be squashed before merging since the first commit does not past lints due to dead code.\r\n\r\nDepends on #47", "reactions": {"url":
