For general usage, the API remains mostly the same, with some improvements and enhancements for better performance and flexibility.</p>\n<p>See migration guide below.</p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[\u2757] Make <code>DOCKER_CONFIG</code> usage consistent with Docker CLI (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/654\">#654</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[\u2757] Support UDP and SCTP port mappings (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/655\">#655</a>)</li>\n<li>Support HTTP wait strategy (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/659\">#659</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Miscellaneous Tasks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Use nightly <code>rustfmt</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/657\">#657</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Refactor</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[\u2757] Get rid of associated type <code>ImageArgs</code> and rename to <code>cmd</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/649\">#649</a>)</li>\n<li>Avoid unnecessary owned structs and boxing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/651\">#651</a>)</li>\n<li>[\u2757] Add <code>ImageExt</code> trait to avoid explicit conversion to <code>RunnableImage</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/652\">#652</a>)</li>\n<li>[\u2757] Rename <code>RunnableImage</code> to <code>ContainerRequest</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/653\">#653</a>)</li>\n<li>[\u2757] Exposed and mapped ports api (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/656\">#656</a>)</li>\n<li>Preliminary refactoring of <code>wait</code> strategies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs/pull/661\">#661</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Migration Guide</h2>\n<h3>1. Renaming of <code>RunnableImage</code></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Old</strong>: <code>RunnableImage</code></li>\n<li><strong>New</strong>: <code>ContainerRequest</code>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update</strong>: The explicit conversion from <code>Image</code> to <code>ContainerRequest</code> (formerly <code>RunnableImage</code>) is no longer necessary. Instead, you can now directly import <code>testcontainers::ImageExt</code> and override image parameters as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Changes to <code>Image</code> Methods</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Method</strong>: <code>Image::tag</code> and <code>Image::name</code>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Old Return Type</strong>: <code>String</code></li>\n<li><strong>New Return Type</strong>: <code>&amp;str</code></li>\n<li><strong>Update</strong>: Update any code that relies on these methods to handle the new return type <code>&amp;str</code>. This change helps improve performance by avoiding unnecessary allocations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Changes to <code>Image::exposed_ports</code></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Method</strong>: <code>Image::exposed_ports</code>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Old Return Type</strong>: Implementation-specific or previously different.</li>\n<li><strong>New Return Type</strong>: <code>&amp;[ContainerPort]</code></li>\n<li><strong>Update</strong>: The method now returns a slice of <code>ContainerPort</code>, which supports exposing ports with protocols <code>TCP</code>, <code>UDP</code>, and <code>SCTP</code>. Update your code to handle the slice accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Removal of Associated Type <code>Args</code> in <code>Image</code></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Old</strong>: <code>Image</code> had an associated type <code>Args</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong>: The associated type <code>Args</code> is removed.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update</strong>: Command arguments are now part of <code>Image::cmd</code>, which returns <code>impl IntoIterator&lt;Item = impl Into&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>. This change allows more flexibility in specifying command arguments. Ensure your code is updated to work with the new method signature.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

can cast error if your tests are already <code>Result</code> based</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <code>Image::exec_after_start</code> method returns a <code>Result</code>, so if you have an implementation of <code>Image</code> that uses <code>exec_after_start</code>, it's important to handle possible errors (e.g required port not found)</li>\n<li>If you encounter container startup timeout, adjust it with <a href=\"https://docs.rs/testcontainers/0.17.0/testcontainers/core/struct.RunnableImage.html#method.with_startup_timeout\"><code>RunnableImage::with_startup_timeout</code></a></li>\n<li>Change <code>testcontainers::CgroupnsMode</code> to <code>testcontainers::core::CgroupnsMode</code> if your code rely on this.</li>\n<li><code>exec</code> now returns a result with ability to get exit code
