This way, authors have the choice of whether they want to do their own error handling or let roperator do it for them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `roperator::handler::failable` module was added, which provides some other useful helpers for users who want to do some error handling in their Handlers. The `FailableHandler` trait was added to provide a somewhat more opinionated and simple trait for Handlers that want to opt in to error handling. The companion `DefaultFailableHandler` wraps `FalableHandler` impls and adapts them to the `Handler` trait.\r\n\r\nSo far, this seems like a better avenue for making error handling somewhat nicer, while still allowing users to easily implement it themselves.

This may seem initially like a regression, but the goal is to add a declarative API for building handler implementations that do various types of error handling for you.

The reality of this ended up being a bit more tricky than expected. Basically, just because a resource exists in the `SyncRequest::children()` doesn't necessarily imply anything about its state. For example, a Pod resource could exist, even though the Pod _status_ indicates that it's no longer running. So a general function that's like `fn does_resource_exist(example_resource: &Value) -> bool` isn't actually a good fit in all cases, since the word \"exist\" could be interpreted in multiple ways, and a `bool` isn't actually a rich enough type to represent all the possible states.\r\n\r\nSo the solution I settled on for this was to simply have a function that returns a matching child resource if one exists. That way, users can inspect the state of it to decide how they should proceed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, I made some other quality of life improvements on `RequestChildren` and `Raw/TypedView`, and refactored the `ObjectId` and `ObjectIdRef` types. All the `Raw/TypedView` functions now accept `impl Into<ObjectIdRef<'_>>` instead of separate `namespace` and `name` arguments. This allows a lot more flexibility in how you can query about resources in `RequestChildren`, as it allows all functions to accept `&ObjectId` and `(&str, &str)` in addition to `ObjectIdRef`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/19/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/18/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18", "id": 577397730, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1MTkxMjE0", "number": 18, "title": "Request api improvements", "user": {"login": "psFried", "id": 4495829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4495829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-03-07T20:43:27Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-07T21:51:41Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-07T21:51:38Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/pulls/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/18.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-07T21:51:38Z"}, "body": "This PR includes some breaking changes in order to finally address #2 .

Since this is really only an issue in development environments, adding full oauth support isn't really the highest priority. But GKE users should still have an easy way to run locally and test against their GKE clusters, and that's what is implemented here. \r\n\r\nThe code changes here really just make it easier to pull all connection information from the kube config file _except_ for the credentials, which can now (optionally) be passed in manually. In addition to exposing those APIs, I also added a detailed reference on how to setup a GCP Service Account and use it to connect to GKE.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/17/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/17/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/10", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/10/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/10/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/issues/10/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/10", "id": 542680980, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU3MDc1NTgw", "number": 10, "title": "Load certificate authority data from a path specified in kube config \u2026", "user": {"login": "psFried", "id": 4495829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU4Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4495829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/psFried/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-12-26T22:06:15Z", "updated_at": "2019-12-26T22:16:12Z", "closed_at": "2019-12-26T22:16:07Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psFried/roperator/pulls/10", "html_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/10", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/10.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psFried/roperator/pull/10.patch", "merged_at": "2019-12-26T22:16:07Z"}, "body": "\u2026file, Fixes #7\r\n\r\nOne minor open issue remains, stemming from the fact that the `CAData::File` variant uses a String to represent a file path.
