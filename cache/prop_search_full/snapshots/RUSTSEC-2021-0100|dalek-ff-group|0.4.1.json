We slash those nodes to disincentive those behaviors.\r\n\r\nIn this case, once a node catches an invalid/bad behavior from another validator, it either sends an evidence for this bad  behavior or a vote to slash the bad node. If an evidence provided and valid, it is solely enough to slash the node by the network participants even if other nodes didn't see this behavior. Once the evidence is on the chain, the bad node is slashed. If a vote is sent, then we wait vote from 2/3 of the nodes to slash the node.\r\n\r\nFor now following points are completed;\r\n\r\n- create a special tx type to publish bad validator behavior data and/or votes for slashing\r\n- modify the tributary to hold the both app txs and this integral tx\r\n- ignore unsigned tendermint tx replays\r\n- verify that provided evidence was actually valid(sender isn't falsely try to claim someone else with invalid evidence).\r\n- scan the slash evidence/votes in the chain\r\n- support unsigned app txs while at it(not really related to this pr but hey! why not)\r\n- enforce provided, unsigned, signed tx ordering within a block\r\n- add unit tests for tendermint tx validation\r\n- update existing mempool/blockchain tests for new tx types",
