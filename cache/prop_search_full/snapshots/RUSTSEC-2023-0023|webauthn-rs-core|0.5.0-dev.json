Migrating to clap 4.x fixes this, so we can re-enable clippy in CI.\r\n\r\nclap 4.x has a few API changes, the main one for us was that it now the original struct field name as a field ID, rather than the \"normalised\" form (changing `_` to `-`), so `conflicts_with_all` and `ArgGroup`s need updating.  It also looks like some parts of clap only check argument definitions at runtime, and errors don't show up with `cargo test`; so we need to run those binaries manually with `--help` to discover errors.\r\n\r\nWhile here, I've done some house-keeping on many `webauthn-authenticator-rs` examples:\r\n\r\n* rename `authenticate/main.rs` to `authenticate.rs`\r\n* rename `cable_domain/main.rs` to `cable_domain.rs`\r\n* `cable_tunnel` example now uses `required-features` in `Cargo.toml`; so `cable_tunnel/main.rs` is gone, and effectively renaming `cable_tunnel/core.rs` to `cable_tunnel.rs`. This also fixes a broken link in the `cable-tunnel-server` README.\r\n* delete obsolete `nfc_token_info` example, as `fido-key-manager` can do the same thing\r\n* rename `softtoken/main.rs` to `softtoken.rs`\r\n\r\nFixes #313\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

this][4] is a little long, and has a few different issues, but the one that hits us here is that deriving `Default` on an `enum` with a generic type parameter forces `T: Default` regardless of whether that type used in the default case.\r\n\r\nAs a simplified example, `Foo<T>` implements something similar to `Option<T>`, and tries to derive `Default`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Default)]\r\nenum Foo<T> {\r\n    #[default]\r\n    None,\r\n    Some(T),\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nstruct Bar {\r\n    v: u8,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let a: Foo<Bar> = Default::default();\r\n    let b = Foo::Some(Bar { v: 1 });\r\n    \r\n    println!(\"{a:?}, {b:?}\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiling that with `rustc >= 1.62.0, <= 1.65.0` results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `Bar: Default` is not satisfied\r\n  --> ./defaults.rs:14:23\r\n   |\r\n14 |     let a: Foo<Bar> = Default::default();\r\n   |

additional warning that deriving `Default` for enums is experimental.\r\n\r\nIt compiles fine with `rustc >= 1.66.0`, so I've set the MSRV explicitly for `webauthn-rs-proto`. It's not clear which PR actually fixed this for `rustc`, and [the bug is still open][4]. \ud83e\udd37 \r\n\r\n`kanidm` already needs Rust 1.66.0.\r\n\r\nThe other packages can have their MSRV updated as things go.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vyx4oj/actionsrs_organization_became_unmaintained/ig54zv7/\r\n[1]: https://crates.io/crates/axum/0.6.1#user-content-minimum-supported-rust-version\r\n[2]: https://github.com/micolous/webauthn-rs/actions/runs/4684510868/jobs/8300730956\r\n[3]: https://github.com/micolous/webauthn-rs/actions/runs/4684549653/jobs/8300810953\r\n[4]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26925\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n- [ ] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [ ] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/301/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/301/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300", "id": 1663791658, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85OF-1s", "number": 300, "title": "Fix broken deviceplug commit due to force-push of dev branch", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-12T05:09:49Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:37Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:36Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/300", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:36Z"}, "body": "We were pinning a commit of `deviceplug` for a Linux-specific bug fix;

Changes\r\n\r\nRelated fixing (which blocked this change):\r\n\r\n* only run `doctest` for features that are enabled\r\n\r\nPublic API changes:\r\n\r\n* `share_cable_authenticator()`'s parameters changed:\r\n  * added `options: ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions` parameter\r\n  * `tunnel_server_id` argument moved to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n  * `close_after_one_command` argument inverted to `stay_open_after_one_command`, and moved to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n  * added `tunnel_uri` field to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n\r\n* Added `connect_cable_authenticator_with_tunnel_uri` method for new feature.\r\n\r\n  This will probably be changed to use a `ConnectCableAuthenticatorOptions` struct like `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions` once there's something else to put in there.\r\n\r\nInternal API changes:\r\n\r\n* `Eid::get_domain` replaced with `Eid::get_domain_builder`\r\n* `Eid::get_connect_uri` now (internally) public\r\n* Added `Eid::build_connect_uri` (internally public)\r\n* Added `Discovery::build_new_tunnel_uri` (internally public)\r\n* `Discovery::get_connect_uri` removed (use `Eid::get_connect_uri` instead)\r\n* Added `uri` parameter to `Tunnel::connect_authenticator`\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n",
