for a cache, and because of that I don't need any backend besides the local one.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've made the Backblaze B2 backend optional through the `backend-b2` feature flag, which I've also added to the default set of features.\r\n\r\nSince the standard error mechanism returns an `std::io::Error`, which isn't very descriptive, I opted for panicking when the requested backend isn't enabled.\r\n\r\n**Note: I haven't actually tested the success and failure path of `rdedup_lib::aio::backend_from_url` as I don't actually use `rdedup`, nor do I have access to Backblaze B2.**",
