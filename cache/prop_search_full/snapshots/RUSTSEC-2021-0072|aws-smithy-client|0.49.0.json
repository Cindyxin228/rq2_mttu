Its the wrong behavior when exporting types from other crates, however, since it doesn't matter what is inside that external type, and rustdoc doesn't include information about inner pieces of the external type in the JSON output.\r\n\r\nTo give a concrete example, let's say we're running `cargo-check-external-types` against `aws-sdk-s3`, and this crate has a `pub use aws_smithy_async::AsyncSleep` statement to re-export the `AsyncSleep` type from `aws-smithy-async`. Before these changes, `cargo-check-external-types` would try to visit each function inside of `AsyncSleep` to see if any of those functions referenced external types. However, it doesn't make any sense to do that since the entire trait is external, and rustdoc's JSON doesn't even bother to include these details. After these changes, it just stops after hitting that external type.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- [x] Verified the tool now works against the changes in https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/pull/1603, where it was failing in CI\r\n- [x] Added a test case that reproduced the issue to the `cargo-check-external-types` test suite\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1654/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1654/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1645", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1645/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1645/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1645/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1645", "id": 1342281754, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj849Wcyi", "number": 1645, "title": "Implement more checks in `cargo-check-external-types`", "user": {"login": "jdisanti", "id": 433028, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzAyOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/433028?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti", "html_url": "https://github.com/jdisanti", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-08-17T20:52:55Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-18T21:41:36Z", "closed_at": "2022-08-18T21:41:36Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/1645", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1645", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1645.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1645.patch", "merged_at": "2022-08-18T21:41:36Z"}, "body": "## Motivation and Context\r\nThis PR adds support for Rust unions to `cargo-check-external-types`, and marks the unstable Rust language features as unsupported.

the python application implementation as a struct, which\r\nwas wrapped by the codegenerated App to allow to dynamically building\r\nthe router.\r\n\r\nThis caused scheduling of coroutines (handlers prefixed with async def)\r\nto block becuse we were passing the Python eventloop of the parent\r\nprocess that was stored pre-fork().\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the runtime PyApp to become a trait, allowing us to\r\ndynamically build the router post-fork() and with the right event loop.\r\n\r\nThis change also allowed us to remove a bunch of unnecessary Arc(s).\r\n\r\n### Add ByteStream implementation\r\n\r\nImplementation of a ByteStream type for Python that can be roughly used like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlet b = await ByteStream.from_path(\"file.txt\")\r\nasync for chunk in b:\r\n    print(chunk)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implement futures_core::stream::Stream for Python ByteStream wrapper.\r\n\r\nThe BytesStream implementation in python can now use a sync Mutex from\r\nparking_lot because we are now using pyo3_asyncio::tokio::local_future_into_py()\r\nto read a chunk, which supports !Send futures.\r\n\r\nThis allows to simply forward the implementation of Stream (poll_next()\r\nand size_hint()) directly to our inner SDK ByteStream.\r\n\r\n### Simplify Python symbol visitor\r\n\r\nInherit from Symbol visitor and override just what is needed to swap Python complex\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Bigo <1781140+crisidev@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- If a checkbox below is not applicable, then please DELETE it rather than
