If relevant (such as any change that modifies the UI), **please provide screenshots** of the change:_\r\n\r\nFor the process widget, we now sum the resource usage of the child processes on the parent entry when collapsing in tree mode.\r\n\r\nFor example - before collapsing:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113538978-a202bf00-95aa-11eb-85fb-82dd6e488cb4.png)\r\n\r\nAfter collapsing:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113538987-a7600980-95aa-11eb-809a-b8634ad0f80c.png)\r\n\r\nNote that if you search to filter, and collapse, it will not sum the pruned values (values that cannot be seen).  This is partly because I'm a bit lazy, and partly because I think this behaviour makes sense.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I search for a process with 4 child processes \"AA, AB, BA, BB\", with CPU usage 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 respectively.  Assume the parent process has 0 usage.\r\n\r\n- Without filter, it sums to 1.0\r\n- With a filter on A, it would sum to just 0.3\r\n- With a filter on AA, it would sum to 0.1\r\n\r\nI think this is fine because I'm treating this as summing any child that is still *visible* somehow.  Summing unseen values would probably be weird as it would look like it's not adding up.\r\n\r\nFurther note that if you had, say, a child \"CC\" with a usage of, say, 2.0, and its parent of \"AB\", and you searched for CC in our above example, you would get a sum of 2.2.  This is because AB is still visible by the fact that CC was the searched process, and AB must still exist (albeit faded out) in the tree hierarchy, and as such will still be displayed.\r\n\r\nWe can see this here:\r\n\r\nSearching \"btm\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539788-93b5a280-95ac-11eb-98f9-a7ce62531b96.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539808-9adcb080-95ac-11eb-857b-914be6f9d24b.png)\r\n\r\nSearching for \"zsh\" instead:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539839-ac25bd00-95ac-11eb-9a4c-4cce86ace75c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34804052/113539846-afb94400-95ac-11eb-9bc6-3f4f809b9287.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n_If applicable, what issue does this address?_\r\n\r\nCloses: #424\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n_Remove the irrelevant ones:_\r\n\r\n- [x] _New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)_\r\n\r\n## Test methodology\r\n\r\n_If relevant, please state how this was tested:_\r\n\r\n_Furthermore, please tick which platforms this change was tested on:_\r\n\r\n- [ ] _Windows_\r\n- [ ] _macOS_\r\n- [x] _Linux_\r\n\r\n_If relevant, all of these platforms should be tested._\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_If relevant, ensure the following have been met:_\r\n\r\n- [x] _Change has been tested to work, and does not cause new breakage unless intended_\r\n- [x] _Code has been self-reviewed_\r\n- [x] _Documentation has been added/updated if needed (README, help menu, etc.)_\r\n- [x] _Passes CI pipeline (clippy check and `cargo test` check)_\r\n- [x] _Areas your change affects have been linted using rustfmt (`cargo fmt`)_\r\n- [x] _No merge conflicts arise from the change_\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n_Provide any other relevant information to this change:_\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/445/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/445/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/444/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444", "id": 849996305, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjA4NjM4MTIx", "number": 444, "title": "refactor: Switch from fnv to fxhash", "user": {"login": "ClementTsang", "id": 34804052, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODA0MDUy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34804052?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang", "html_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ClementTsang/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-04-05T00:34:25Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-05T00:48:20Z", "closed_at": "2021-04-05T00:48:19Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ClementTsang/bottom/pulls/444", "html_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/pull/444.patch", "merged_at": "2021-04-05T00:48:19Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n_A description of the change and what it does.
