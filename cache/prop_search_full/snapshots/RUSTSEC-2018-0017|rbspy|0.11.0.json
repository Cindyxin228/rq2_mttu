The memory-walking logic is complex but has been very reliable in my testing so far. \r\n\r\nI wasn't able to locate the global symbol table for 2.6 or older, so support is currently limited to 2.7.x (and newer, hopefully). It may be possible to expand this with more investigation -- I probably missed something. I haven't tried rubies newer than 2.7.2 yet.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample from tracing a simple puma server when it's under load:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSummary of profiling data so far:\r\n% self  % total  name\r\n 25.45    25.45  <c function> - sleep\r\n 13.64    13.64  <c function> - expand_path\r\n 11.82    49.09  <c function> - unknown\r\n  3.64    20.91  block in <class:Base> - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/sinatra-2.1.0/lib/sinatra/base.rb\r\n  3.64     4.55  <c function> - select\r\n  3.64     3.64  <c function> - syswrite\r\n  2.73     2.73  <c function> - write\r\n  2.73     2.73  <c function> - peeraddr\r\n  1.82    74.55  block in spawn_thread - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/puma-5.2.1/lib/puma/thread_pool.rb\r\n  1.82    43.64  call - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/sinatra-2.1.0/lib/sinatra/base.rb\r\n  1.82    41.82  call - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/rack-2.2.3/lib/rack/logger.rb\r\n  1.82    30.91  call! - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/sinatra-2.1.0/lib/sinatra/base.rb\r\n  1.82     2.73  append - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/puma-5.2.1/lib/puma/io_buffer.rb\r\n  1.82     2.73  <c function> - each\r\n  1.82     1.82  <c function> - exist?\r\n  1.82     1.82  <c function> - close\r\n  0.91    48.18  block in handle_request - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/puma-5.2.1/lib/puma/request.rb\r\n  0.91    46.36  with_force_shutdown - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/puma-5.2.1/lib/puma/thread_pool.rb\r\n  0.91    43.64  call - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/rack-2.2.3/lib/rack/head.rb\r\n  0.91    37.27  call - /Users/acj/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/rack-protection-2.1.0/lib/rack/protection/frame_options.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\nand when running `infinite.rb`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSummary of profiling data so far:\r\n% self  % total  name\r\n100.00   100.00  <c function> - sleep\r\n  0.00   100.00  ccc - ci/ruby-programs/infinite.rb\r\n  0.00   100.00  block in <main> - ci/ruby-programs/infinite.rb\r\n  0.00   100.00  bbb - ci/ruby-programs/infinite.rb\r\n  0.00   100.00  aaa - ci/ruby-programs/infinite.rb\r\n  0.00   100.00  <main> - ci/ruby-programs/infinite.rb\r\n  0.00   100.00  <c function> - loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed that gdb is also able to print the raw C symbol name and its location in the source file. I don't know whether it's possible for rbspy to get that info, but it would be nice to have. Maybe the `remoteprocess` crate can do the symbol resolution part since we have the memory address.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Clean up confusing variable names in memory-walking code\r\n- [x] Clean up duplicated logic\r\n- [x] Add support for older ruby versions where possible\r\n- [x] Try newer ruby versions (e.g. 3.x) -- blocked by #285 \r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [x] Add Windows support, if possible\r\n- [x] Address CI failures on cross builds\r\n\r\nFixes #110", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rbspy/rbspy/issues/282/reactions", "total_count": 19, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

I\u2019ve found the code and blog posts on developing rbspy incredibly useful and inspiring.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to get rbspy working on Windows. It doesn\u2019t totally work just yet, but I thought I would share where I\u2019m at anyways.\r\n\r\nIn particular this PR:\r\n\r\n* makes rbspy build on windows\r\n* adds code to read virtual memory maps on windows and load symbols from windows processes\r\n* Provides windows implementations of the address_finder::get_ruby_version_address and current_thread_address functions\r\n* refactors proc_maps/mac_maps/win_maps into a subcrate, and has all OS implementations expose a common interface (get_process_maps/MapRange)\r\n\r\nWith these changes rbspy can connect up to a process on windows, and correctly determine the version of ruby running. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately when trying to copy the stack traces it fails with an error like:\r\n\r\n\tCopy error: stack base and cfp address out of sync. stack base: 28ce010, cfp address: 294df20\r\n\r\nI'm a little stuck on exactly what is going wrong here to be honest. I was hoping someone here might have any ideas of where I'm going wrong here =)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm interested in using the proc-maps code in another project I'm working on - and I was wondering if we could extract to a standalone crate? I think moving the proc-maps folder to its own repo and then updating the Cargo.toml file here should be sufficient. I'm willing to set this up, but wanted to make sure that this is something you'd be interested in first. This can be done independently of the rest of the windows changes here, since you probably don't merge this just yet.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
