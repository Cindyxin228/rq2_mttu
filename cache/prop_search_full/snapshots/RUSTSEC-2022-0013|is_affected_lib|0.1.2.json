That is, `\\<` and `\\>`. The minimum supported Rust\nversion has also been raised to 1.65, which was released about one year ago.\n\nThe new word boundary assertions are:\n\n-   `\\<` or `\\b{start}`: a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the left,\n    `\\w` on the right).\n-   `\\>` or `\\b{end}`: a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\w` on the left, `\\W|\\z`\n    on the right)).\n-   `\\b{start-half}`: half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the\n    left).\n-   `\\b{end-half}`: half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\z` on the\n    right).\n\nThe `\\<` and `\\>` are GNU extensions to POSIX regexes. They have been added\nto the `regex` crate because they enjoy somewhat broad support in other regex\nengines as well (for example, vim). The `\\b{start}` and `\\b{end}` assertions\nare aliases for `\\<` and `\\>`, respectively.\n\nThe `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` assertions are not found in any\nother regex engine (although regex engines with general look-around support\ncan certainly express them). They were added principally to support the\nimplementation of word matching in grep programs, where one generally wants to\nbe a bit more flexible in what is considered a word boundary.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;469](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469):\n    Add support for `\\<` and `\\>` word boundary assertions.\n-   [FEATURE(regex-automata) #&#8203;1031](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1031):\n    DFAs now have a `start_state` method that doesn't use an `Input`.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1051](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1051):\n    Unicode character class operations have been optimized in `regex-syntax`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1090](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1090):\n    Make patterns containing lots of literal characters use less memory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1046](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1046):\n    Fix a bug that could result in incorrect match spans when using a Unicode word\n    boundary and searching non-ASCII strings.\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1047](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1047):\n    Fix panics that can occur in `Ast->Hir` translation (not reachable from `regex`\n    crate).\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1088](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1088):\n    Remove guarantees in the API that connect the `u` flag with a specific HIR\n    representation.\n\n`regex-automata` breaking change release:\n\nThis release includes a `regex-automata 0.4.0` breaking change release, which\nwas necessary in order to support the new word boundary assertions. For\nexample, the `Look` enum has new variants and the `LookSet` type now uses `u32`\ninstead of `u16` to represent a bitset of look-around assertions. These are\noverall very minor changes, and most users of `regex-automata` should be able\nto move to `0.4` from `0.3` without any changes at all.\n\n`regex-syntax` breaking change release:\n\nThis release also includes a `regex-syntax 0.8.0` breaking change release,\nwhich, like `regex-automata`, was necessary in order to support the new word\nboundary assertions. This release also includes some changes to the `Ast`\ntype to reduce heap usage in some cases. If you are using the `Ast` type\ndirectly, your code may require some minor modifications. Otherwise, users of\n`regex-syntax 0.7` should be able to migrate to `0.8` without any code changes.\n\n`regex-lite` release:\n\nThe `regex-lite 0.1.1` release contains support for the new word boundary\nassertions. There are no breaking changes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

That is, `\\<` and `\\>`. The minimum supported Rust\nversion has also been raised to 1.65, which was released about one year ago.\n\nThe new word boundary assertions are:\n\n-   `\\<` or `\\b{start}`: a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the left,\n    `\\w` on the right).\n-   `\\>` or `\\b{end}`: a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\w` on the left, `\\W|\\z`\n    on the right)).\n-   `\\b{start-half}`: half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the\n    left).\n-   `\\b{end-half}`: half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\z` on the\n    right).\n\nThe `\\<` and `\\>` are GNU extensions to POSIX regexes. They have been added\nto the `regex` crate because they enjoy somewhat broad support in other regex\nengines as well (for example, vim). The `\\b{start}` and `\\b{end}` assertions\nare aliases for `\\<` and `\\>`, respectively.\n\nThe `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` assertions are not found in any\nother regex engine (although regex engines with general look-around support\ncan certainly express them). They were added principally to support the\nimplementation of word matching in grep programs, where one generally wants to\nbe a bit more flexible in what is considered a word boundary.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;469](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469):\n    Add support for `\\<` and `\\>` word boundary assertions.\n-   [FEATURE(regex-automata) #&#8203;1031](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1031):\n    DFAs now have a `start_state` method that doesn't use an `Input`.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1051](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1051):\n    Unicode character class operations have been optimized in `regex-syntax`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1090](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1090):\n    Make patterns containing lots of literal characters use less memory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1046](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1046):\n    Fix a bug that could result in incorrect match spans when using a Unicode word\n    boundary and searching non-ASCII strings.\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1047](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1047):\n    Fix panics that can occur in `Ast->Hir` translation (not reachable from `regex`\n    crate).\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1088](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1088):\n    Remove guarantees in the API that connect the `u` flag with a specific HIR\n    representation.\n\n`regex-automata` breaking change release:\n\nThis release includes a `regex-automata 0.4.0` breaking change release, which\nwas necessary in order to support the new word boundary assertions. For\nexample, the `Look` enum has new variants and the `LookSet` type now uses `u32`\ninstead of `u16` to represent a bitset of look-around assertions. These are\noverall very minor changes, and most users of `regex-automata` should be able\nto move to `0.4` from `0.3` without any changes at all.\n\n`regex-syntax` breaking change release:\n\nThis release also includes a `regex-syntax 0.8.0` breaking change release,\nwhich, like `regex-automata`, was necessary in order to support the new word\nboundary assertions. This release also includes some changes to the `Ast`\ntype to reduce heap usage in some cases. If you are using the `Ast` type\ndirectly, your code may require some minor modifications. Otherwise, users of\n`regex-syntax 0.7` should be able to migrate to `0.8` without any code changes.\n\n`regex-lite` release:\n\nThe `regex-lite 0.1.1` release contains support for the new word boundary\nassertions. There are no breaking changes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

They were added principally to support the\nimplementation of word matching in grep programs, where one generally wants to\nbe a bit more flexible in what is considered a word boundary.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;469](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469):\n    Add support for `\\<` and `\\>` word boundary assertions.\n-   [FEATURE(regex-automata) #&#8203;1031](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1031):\n    DFAs now have a `start_state` method that doesn't use an `Input`.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1051](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1051):\n    Unicode character class operations have been optimized in `regex-syntax`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1090](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1090):\n    Make patterns containing lots of literal characters use less memory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1046](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1046):\n    Fix a bug that could result in incorrect match spans when using a Unicode word\n    boundary and searching non-ASCII strings.\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1047](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1047):\n    Fix panics that can occur in `Ast->Hir` translation (not reachable from `regex`\n    crate).\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1088](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1088):\n    Remove guarantees in the API that connect the `u` flag with a specific HIR\n    representation.\n\n`regex-automata` breaking change release:\n\nThis release includes a `regex-automata 0.4.0` breaking change release, which\nwas necessary in order to support the new word boundary assertions. For\nexample, the `Look` enum has new variants and the `LookSet` type now uses `u32`\ninstead of `u16` to represent a bitset of look-around assertions. These are\noverall very minor changes, and most users of `regex-automata` should be able\nto move to `0.4` from `0.3` without any changes at all.\n\n`regex-syntax` breaking change release:\n\nThis release also includes a `regex-syntax 0.8.0` breaking change release,\nwhich, like `regex-automata`, was necessary in order to support the new word\nboundary assertions. This release also includes some changes to the `Ast`\ntype to reduce heap usage in some cases. If you are using the `Ast` type\ndirectly, your code may require some minor modifications. Otherwise, users of\n`regex-syntax 0.7` should be able to migrate to `0.8` without any code changes.\n\n`regex-lite` release:\n\nThe `regex-lite 0.1.1` release contains support for the new word boundary\nassertions. There are no breaking changes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
