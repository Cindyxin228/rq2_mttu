22/09/2023\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n - Rust runtime which runs a GraphQL server (warp & juniper based), Deno runtime, Scryer prolog engine & Holochain. Rust runtime now used as the main logic for ADAM and loads old JS code where needed, giving migration path to full Rust.\r\n - Entanglement proof logic to ADAM to allow linking of ADAM DID's, Holochain Keys & Blockchain wallets\r\n - Ability to update ADAM Layer via the Launcher\r\n - MacOS signing in CD\r\n - Ability to create paginated queries directly to prolog engine\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n - Updated Holochain to 0.2.2\r\n - Updated Tauri to latest version 1.4.1\r\n - All seperate ADAM Layer services now run on seperate thread pools\r\n - ADAM Rust CLI can now init and run an agent\r\n - ADAM Rust CLI command line arguments for init and run refactor to be much cleaner\r\n - Each Perspective now has its own independant Scryer Prolog thread\r\n - Whole ADAM Layer package now runs from a single binary; either ADAM CLI or ADAM Launcher\r\n - ADAM Languages now expected to be Deno compatible modules; not old ESM node JS\r\n - JS executor now builds to be a Deno bundle to be consumed by rust-executor\r\n \r\n### Deprecated\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n - SWIPL Prolog\r\n - No longer used a node library to parse results coming in and out of a prolog engine\r\n - AD4M Host\r\n - GraphQL server from JS code\r\n - Agent key methods from JS code\r\n - Independant Holochain, HC & Lair-keystore binaries\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n - Slow launcher start\r\n - Very high CPU usage from ADAM and its related services\r\n - No longer reconnection issues after sleeping computer or closing ADAM app instances", "reactions": {"url":
