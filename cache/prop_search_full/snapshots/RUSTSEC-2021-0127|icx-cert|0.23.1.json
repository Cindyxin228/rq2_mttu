bounds).\r\n\r\nThis change also technically moves `ReqwestHttpReplicaV2Transport` to it's own module, but everything is re-exported for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nAlso some minor style fixes and refactors:\r\n\r\n- `PasswordManager::get` simplifies usage\r\n- Remove `default-features` from `ic-utils`'s import of `ic-agent` (lets `icx-proxy` completely remove `reqwest` from dependency tree)\r\n- Remove superfluous `Principal::to_text` call in formatting code (`to_text` just calls `Display` anyway)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with
