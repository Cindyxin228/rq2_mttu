Although this allows certain flexibility (e.g. choosing openssl vs rustls), it was probably the wrong abstraction layer in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis change moves most of the genericism to the grpc-service layer for grpc services (bigtable and pubsub). The library's \"common\" path via builders will provide a sensible default implementation, but it will now be possible to substitute the entire tower::service stack provided to the grpc API. This is more flexible than the prior connector abstraction, but also harder to use (you basically have to build everything yourself). This feels like the right balance between a batteries-included default and a build-your-own option.\r\n\r\nAlong the way I've also made some updates to non-exhaustivity in generated code, to help ease future changes without breaking semver. This is unfortunately less ergonomic, but not _too_ bad. Future changes may include some builder pattern to make protobuf construction easier.\r\n\r\nThe GCS API is still largely the same, however it is still not in an ideal place. Future changes may bring it more towards service abstraction.\r\n\r\nFinally, this change includes updates to tonic and prost, bringing them up to the latest versions.\r\n\r\nSupersedes #30\r\nFixes

I'm reopening the PR exactly as before, but with this note & a commit which makes `tokio` a required dependency.\r\n\r\n# Original description\r\n\r\nThis PR's aim was to add service account impersonation as an authentication method, but in order to do this I had to update the version of `yup-oauth` to 8.1, which required quite a lot of changes.\r\n\r\nThe main one is that I removed the concept of `TokenSource` from this repository, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- first, `yup-oauth` changed a bunch of things regarding how tokens work (a big one is that token generation can produce `None` now), making `TokenSource` difficult to adapt;\r\n- and second, because `TokenSource` was a bit redundant with `yup-oauth`'s own concept of [authenticators](https://docs.rs/yup-oauth2/latest/yup_oauth2/authenticator/index.html).\r\n\r\nSince version 6, the library has added many new authenticators, covering (I think) the use cases that `TokenSource` was covering.  Instead of a token source, `AuthGrpcService` now carries an authenticator and a list of scopes.\r\n\r\nUpdating `yup-oauth` also required replacing the `C: crate::Connect + Clone + Send + Sync + 'static` bounds with the following mouthful:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC: tower::Service<http::Uri> + Clone + Send + Sync + 'static,\r\nC::Response: hyper::client::connect::Connection\r\n    + tokio::io::AsyncRead\r\n    + tokio::io::AsyncWrite\r\n    + Send\r\n    + Unpin\r\n    + 'static,\r\nC::Future: Send + Unpin + 'static,\r\nC::Error: Into<Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>>,\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe reason being that `hyper::Connect` is actually a private trait that cannot be implemented, and so `yup-oauth` changed at some point to the bounds above, which are equivalent, albeit annoying.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/issues/25/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/issues/25/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/issues/16", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/issues/16/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/issues/16/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/issues/16/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/ya-gcp/pull/16", "id": 1495264541, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGFozc85FYAEm", "number": 16, "title": "Add better tracing support", "user": {"login": "zmitchell", "id": 10246891, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ2ODkx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10246891?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell", "html_url": "https://github.com/zmitchell", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmitchell/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2022-12-13T22:29:11Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-14T22:13:22Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-14T22:13:22Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/ya-gcp/pulls/16", "html_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/ya-gcp/pull/16", "diff_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/ya-gcp/pull/16.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/ya-gcp/pull/16.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-14T22:13:22Z"}, "body": "This PR adds `tracing` spans to publish/subscribe paths as well as a few `debug!` events for good measure to aid in debugging.
