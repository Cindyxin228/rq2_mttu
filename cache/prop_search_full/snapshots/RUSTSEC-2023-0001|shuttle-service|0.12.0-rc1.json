The cache is first checked for the key (cookie or api-key), if it is there set it on the request in the `ShuttleAuthLayer`. If it isn't, request an upgrade from the `auth` server through the proxy. If it succeeds, extract the token from the proxy response and set it in the cache, before setting it on the request and proceeding.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more elegant to have the cache be a layer on the proxy client, but I had some difficulty implementing this. It's certainly something we should consider in the future.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass except for one assertion in the `api_create_get_delete_projects` test, which is commented out. It was indeed broken, but it was testing functionality we don't have.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/643/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
