This release exposes some new lower level APIs on `Regex` that permit\n> amortizing allocation and controlling the location at which a search is\n> performed in a more granular way. Most users of the regex crate will not\n> need or want to use these APIs.\n> \n> New features:\n> \n> * [FEATURE [#493](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/493)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/493):\n>   Add a few lower level APIs for amortizing allocation and more fine grained\n>   searching.\n> \n> Bug fixes:\n> \n> * [BUG 3981d2ad](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/3981d2ad):\n>   Correct outdated documentation on `RegexBuilder::dot_matches_new_line`.\n> * [BUG 7ebe4ae0](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/7ebe4ae0):\n>   Correct outdated documentation on `Parser::allow_invalid_utf8` in the\n>   `regex-syntax` crate.\n> * [BUG 24c7770b](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/24c7770b):\n>   Fix a bug in the HIR printer where it wouldn't correctly escape meta\n>   characters in character classes.\n> \n> \n> 1.0.1 (2018-06-19)\n> ==================\n> This release upgrades regex's Unicode tables to Unicode 11, and enables SIMD\n> optimizations automatically on Rust stable (1.27 or newer).\n> \n> New features:\n> \n> * [FEATURE [#486](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/486)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/486):\n>   Implement `size_hint` on `RegexSet` match iterators.\n> * [FEATURE [#488](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/488)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/488):\n>   Update Unicode tables for Unicode 11.\n> * [FEATURE [#490](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/490)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/490):\n>   SIMD optimizations are now enabled automatically in Rust stable, for versions\n>   1.27 and up. No compilation flags or features need to be set. CPU support\n>   SIMD is detected automatically at runtime.\n> \n> Bug fixes:\n> \n> * [BUG [#482](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/482)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/482):\n>   Present a better compilation error when the `use_std` feature isn't used.\n> \n> \n> 1.0.0 (2018-05-01)\n> ==================\n> This release marks the 1.0 release of regex.\n></table> ...
