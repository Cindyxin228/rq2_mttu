like it so I wrote one, also I have no idea why the other one seems abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier version I tried to put parts of the layout calculation in Widget::on_event(), and output it through the widget state to Overlay::layout(), it makes the most sense to do so bc the layout is dynamic and reacts to events, but iced expects layout before event handling, apart from that, I can't get the viewport size in on_event(), without which there's no way to achieve adaptive open direction\r\n\r\nSo I went the extra mile to rewrite it so that they are completely separated and the new layout will be calculated after the previous event update. But it's so error prone and causes a ton of weird bugs. I've been trying to clean it up but it's still messy af. Right now it's fairly stable, as least in my tests\r\n\r\nI'm quite satisfied with the result tho, it supports any widget, adaptive open direction and path highlight. \r\n\r\nThere're still some limitations:\r\n- No adaptive menu width, bc I can't get a minimum required width from any widget, I could have it manually set for each menu, but it's such a hassle I doubt anyone wanna do that.\r\n\r\n- No arbitrary item height. It's more of a design choice than limitation, I could support that with flex::resolve(), but when users do want uniform height, which is almost always, they have to manually sync the height of each widget, that's a problem when some widgets don't let you set its height. Maybe it's good to have an option, what do you guys think?\r\n\r\n- No scrolling, yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now the API is a bit verbose, you have to wrap a MenuTree::new() to almost every widget\r\n```\r\nlet sub_menu = MenuTree::with_children(\r\n        button(\"sub menu\"),\r\n        vec![\r\n            MenuTree::new(button(\"item\")),\r\n            MenuTree::new(button(\"item\")),\r\n            MenuTree::new(button(\"item\")),\r\n            ...\r\n        ]\r\n    );\r\n```\r\nI tried to simplify it with macros but haven't quite figured it out", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/issues/86/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/issues/86/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/issues/82", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/issues/82/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/issues/82/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/issues/82/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/iced-rs/iced_aw/pull/82", "id": 1562670263, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEtmUjc5I08Z9", "number": 82, "title": "Removed Colors feature as it is required for most widgets now.", "user": {"login": "genusistimelord", "id": 1034709, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQ3MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1034709?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord", "html_url": "https://github.com/genusistimelord", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/genusistimelord/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-01-30T15:31:37Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-30T15:31:47Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-30T15:31:47Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced_aw/pulls/82", "html_url": "https://github.com/iced-rs/iced_aw/pull/82", "diff_url": "https://github.com/iced-rs/iced_aw/pull/82.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/iced-rs/iced_aw/pull/82.patch", "merged_at": "2023-01-30T15:31:47Z"}, "body": "This will remove the color feature.
