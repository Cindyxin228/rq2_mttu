It impls `Display` now, so the user can elect to log it or not.  \r\n\r\n### Macros\r\n* Disallow unrecognized derive macro attribute paths.\r\n* Allow the required `migrations` module to be `mod.rs` in the same directory as the migrations.\r\n* Don't error on hidden files in migration directory.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n* `Query` changes: resilient to block quotes, has an `&mut self` to append an
