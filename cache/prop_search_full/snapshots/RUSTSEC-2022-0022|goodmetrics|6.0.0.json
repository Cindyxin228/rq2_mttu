By leaning into it a little, this pr gets nearly 18x more throughput with 8 cores (on a macbook), and still reaches 25% more throughput at 20% lower latency with 1 core.\r\n\r\nBroadly, there are 2 big performance increases in here:\r\n\r\n1) Moving metrics aggregation into a separate thread, via mpsc. This removed a Mutex that all Metrics drop()s had to go through. Now they just go into an mpsc SyncSender.\r\n\r\nThis change made it possible to change the AggregatingSink to just be an Aggregator. It is supposed to take a thread now, and just marshal metrics through aggregation. The threaded context is now over `self` as well, which means there is no need for a Mutex. Since we have `self` and SC from mpsc, we can blindly exploit `&mut self`. This makes metrics aggregation non-blocking and very lightweight.\r\n\r\nBy moving metrics aggregation to a dedicated thread and removing the Mutex from the drop path, direct consumers of the record_scope() api should see significantly lower latency and accordingly higher throughput.\r\n\r\n2) Removing reference requirement from MetricsAllocator. This was an experiment, but it made a huge difference to record_scope() users. After the improvements in 1), this further refined another 10-20%, depending on contention. 10% would be worth the simplification, but in single-threaded use cases it improves as much as 20%. The cost here is that it is likely going to cause some churn.\r\n\r\nThese changes together are breaking. I may remove the pooled allocator in the future, but I'll leave it for the time being.\r\n\r\nConcurrency level 8 comparison to main, record_scope measurement overhead:\r\n![image](https://github.com/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/assets/3454741/52315c8c-5cb6-43d6-ad2e-9d89964067af)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/issues/7/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/issues/7/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/issues/4", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/issues/4/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/issues/4/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/issues/4/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/pull/4", "id": 1578427975, "node_id": "PR_kwDOINH-cs5JpYrK", "number": 4, "title": "remove protoc from goodmetrics build dependencies", "user": {"login": "kvc0", "id": 3454741, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTQ3NDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3454741?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kvc0", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kvc0/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-02-09T18:56:39Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-09T20:00:56Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-09T20:00:51Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/pulls/4", "html_url": "https://github.com/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/pull/4", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/pull/4.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kvc0/goodmetrics_rs/pull/4.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-09T20:00:51Z"}, "body": "Adds an unpublished sidecar workspace project that tries to watch the proto directory and generate protos into the main library.
