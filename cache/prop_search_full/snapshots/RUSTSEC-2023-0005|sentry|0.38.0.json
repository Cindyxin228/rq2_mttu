This will be a notable performance\nimprovement for most newish x86-64 systems. This will likely raise the minimum\nbinutils version supported for very old Linux distros.</p>\n<h1>Version 0.17.12 (2025-03-05)</h1>\n<p>Bug fix: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/2447\">briansmith/ring#2447</a> for denial of service (DoS).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic in <code>ring::aead::quic::HeaderProtectionKey::new_mask()</code> when\ninteger overflow checking is enabled. In the QUIC protocol, an attacker can\ninduce this panic by sending a specially-crafted packet. Even unintentionally\nit is likely to occur in 1 out of every 2**32 packets sent and/or received.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic on 64-bit targets in <code>ring::aead::{AES_128_GCM, AES_256_GCM}</code>\nwhen overflow checking is enabled, when encrypting/decrypting approximately\n68,719,476,700 bytes (about 64 gigabytes) of data in a single chunk. Protocols\nlike TLS and SSH are not affected by this because those protocols break large\namounts of data into small chunks. Similarly, most applications will not\nattempt to encrypt/decrypt 64GB of data in one chunk.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overflow checking is not enabled in release mode by default, but\n<code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C overflow-checks&quot;</code> or <code>overflow-checks = true</code> in the Cargo.toml\nprofile can override this. Overflow checking is usually enabled by default in\ndebug mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/commits\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=ring&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.17.8&new-version=0.17.13)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Summary\r\nThis PR adds the ability to capture HTTP request bodies in the Sentry Actix middleware, allowing for better debugging and error tracking capabilities. The feature is configurable through the `max_request_body_size` option in `ClientOptions`.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added `MaxRequestBodySize` enum to control request body capture behavior:\r\n  - `None`: Don't capture request bodies (default)\r\n  - `Small`: Capture up to 1000 bytes\r\n  - `Medium`: Capture up to 10000 bytes\r\n  - `Always`: Capture entire body\r\n- Added request body capture support for `JSON` and `form-urlencoded` content types\r\n- Implemented body capture and restoration logic to maintain request integrity\r\n- Added necessary dependencies: serde_json, actix-http\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n- Request bodies are only captured for content types `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`\r\n- The body is read from the request stream and then restored to maintain middleware transparency\r\n- Size limits are enforced based on the configured `max_request_body_size` option\r\n- Empty string is returned for bodies exceeding size limits\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":
