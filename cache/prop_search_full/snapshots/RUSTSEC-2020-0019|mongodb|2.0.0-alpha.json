In doing so, it also re-architects the connection pool to use a channel based WaitQueue rather than semaphore based one. This was done to allow for easier and more effective maintenance of the wait queue now that we need to support arbitrary conditions for exiting the queue (e.g. maxConnecting). \r\n\r\nI realize that a rewrite of this magnitude typically goes through a design phase, so I apologize for suddenly dropping it like this. I decided it was the preferable choice for this POC largely because a counting semaphore wait queue was frustrating to extend to use in this case, and that this lockless + channel-based pattern is a [much more common aproach in the async world for accessing shared state](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.22/tokio/sync/index.html#mpsc-channel) than our previous lock heavy one. Maintaining the old pool and adding support for maxConnecting would introduce even _more_ locking while also producing a suboptimal solution (impossible or difficult to ensure fairness with multiple semaphores/locks in this case), so this seemed like an good time for a rewrite. Additionally, this is a proof-of-concept after all, so I figured it would be a good time to proof-of-concept what an idiomatic async pool would look like too. I think that I should have opted for a pool like this back when I originally converted the old pool to async, but I was lacking in experience with async patterns at the time. Ironically, the original sync pool with its queue of condvars was somewhat similar to this one.\r\n\r\n## Overview of new pool\r\n\r\nI'll give a brief overview of the layout of the new pool here to make digesting the actual code a little easier. We have the same clonable `ConnectionPool` type as before with the same functionality; however, when we create a new pool, instead of creating a `ConnectionPoolInner` type that is arc'd and wrapping that, we start a worker task (`ConnectionPoolWorker`) that opens up a few different channels, and we store senders to those channels (`ConnectionRequester`, `PoolManager`) on the `ConnectionPool`. The worker task is in charge of all changes and access to the connection pool state; to do anything with the pool, a you need to send a request via one of the two senders mentioned before. To check out a connection for example, a thread sends a `ConnectionRequest` via a `ConnectionRequester` and waits for the worker to respond. To perform any other pool interactions (e.g. clearing, checking in), a thread uses the `PoolManager` to send the appropriate requests. The `ConnectionRequesters` act like strong references to the pool in that they keep the worker alive until they are all dropped, whereas `PoolManagers` are like weak references and can still be in scope when the worker ceases execution. A `ConnectionPool` instance holds onto both a `ConnectionRequester` and a `PoolManager`, but a `Connection` for example only holds on to a `PoolManager` in order to check itself back in. Instead of having a separate background task for ensuring minPoolSize, the worker task just takes care of that.\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n- `ConnectionPoolInner` gone, replaced with a background worker task `ConnectionPoolWorker` that has exclusive access to pool state\r\n- `ConnectionPoolWorker` listens on a few channels for incoming requests, responding to them as necessary\r\n- Threads can check out connections via `ConnectionRequester`s. The `ConnectionPoolWorker` quits once all the requesters are dropped\r\n- Threads can modify the pool state via `PoolManager`s. These do _not_ keep the worker running and may no-op if outlive the worker.\r\n- `Connection`s use `PoolManager`s to check themselves back in\r\n\r\n### Some notes\r\nGiven this architecture, it was trivially easy to introduce maxConnecting: we simply don't poll the `ConnectionRequestReceiver` when the pool is empty and has too many pending connections. The actual changes required to implement that part are all in the last few commits or so. Additionally, we now have a context which always has exclusive access to the pool state, making it much easier to reason about. Lastly, the `drop` implementations of the various connection types have been simplified with the removal of `ConnectionPoolInner` and `DroppedConnectionState`.", "reactions": {"url":
