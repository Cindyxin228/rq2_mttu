Although there are a ton of changes, the transformations are simple for the most part.\r\n\r\nRuntimeWithEpochManagerAdapter was the previous combined trait. There were two implementations of that trait: NightshadeRuntime and KeyValueRuntime.\r\n\r\nNow, RuntimeWithEpochManagerAdapter is split into three: EpochManagerAdapter, ShardTracker, and RuntimeAdapter:\r\n - EpochManagerAdapter is a direct abstraction of EpochManagerHandle (which is basically a `Mutex<EpochManager>`). The reason why we cannot use EpochManagerHandle directly instead of a trait is because KeyValueRuntime cannot provide a concrete EpochManager implementation. It has a completely custom validator schedule that is not compatible at all. NightshadeRuntime, on the other hand, contains an embedded EpochManagerHandle.\r\n - ShardTracker is just a TrackedConfig plus an `Arc<dyn EpochManagerAdapter>`. It doesn't belong to EpochManagerAdapter because the TrackedConfig is not inherent to the protocol. ShardTracker is responsible for one thing: calculating whether this node itself cares or will care about a specific shard. For querying whether some *other* validator is supposed to track a shard, use the EpochManagerAdapter, not ShardTracker.\r\n - RuntimeAdapter is an abstraction of everything that has to do with the runtime and account storage, such as `get_trie_for_shard`. It does bleed a little bit into the EpochManagerAdapter responsibilities, more on that later.\r\n\r\nHow does this split work for the two implementations: NightshadeRuntime and KeyValueRuntime?\r\n - NightshadeRuntime is split into EpochManagerHandle, ShardTracker, and NightshadeRuntime. So essentially, EpochManagerHandle is moved out (well, conceptually, but it still keeps a reference to it because some runtime methods depend on it - eventually this can be moved out as well and have the EpochManagerAdapter be passed in), ShardTracker is moved out, and NightshadeRuntime itself now only implements RuntimeAdapter.\r\n   - When constructing the NightshadeRuntime, we must first construct the EpochManagerHandle. This is because we cannot have the NightshadeRuntime internally construct a different EpochManagerHandle, or else the two EpochManagers will not synchronize state, and things fail.\r\n - KeyValueRuntime is split into KeyValueEpochManager, and KeyValueRuntime. There's no ShardTracker specific to KeyValueXXX anymore (because it's a concrete type to begin with). KeyValueRuntime takes as a constructor argument KeyValueEpochManager; but here it's really just to help initialize some fields (num_shards, epoch_length, etc.).\r\n\r\nNow, we talk about how users of this split are modified accordingly:\r\n - Wherever a struct used to keep a field `runtime_adapter: Arc<dyn RuntimeWithEpochManagerAdapter>`, it is now split into three fields, `epoch_manager: Arc<dyn EpochManagerAdapter>`, `shard_tracker: ShardTracker`, and `runtime: Arc<dyn RuntimeAdapter>`, but we can omit some of them if they are not actually used. Usages of the old field are individually changed to use only one of the new fields.\r\n   - Note that queries to `self.runtime_adapter.cares_about_shard(..., ..., ..., is_me: true)` is changed to `self.shard_tracker.care_about_shard(..., ..., ..., true)` whereas `self.runtime_adapter.cares_about_shard(..., ..., ..., is_me: false)` is changed to `self.epoch_manager.cares_about_shard_from_prev_block`, because the latter does not actually need the ShardTracker.\r\n   - Wherever we used to convert a runtime_adapter into one of the subtraits, we now must construct the subtrait directly:\r\n      - any `Arc<dyn RuntimeWithEpochManagerAdapter>` argument that was passed in is split into up to three arguments depending on which are actually used.\r\n      - any direct construction of NightshadeRuntime is easily converted to separate constructions of EpochManager, NightshadeRuntime, and ShardTracker.\r\n      - any direct construction of KeyValueRuntime is easily converted to separate constructions of KeyValueEpochManager, KeyValueRuntime, and ShardTracker.\r\n - The TestEnv is one big part of this refactoring. The TestEnvBuilder used to take a `.runtime_adapters(Vec<Arc<dyn RuntimeWithEpochManagerAdapter>>)`, but now we don't have the RuntimeWithEpochManagerAdapters anymore. We could split this into three, of course, but this would present a pretty bad inconvenience to any tests that call helpers like create_nightshade_runtimes(...). So, the logic is now the following:\r\n   - There are now .stores(...), .epoch_managers(...), .shard_trackers(...), and .runtimes(...) overrides available. These must be overridden in an appropriate partial order (epoch_managers > stores, shard_trackers > epoch_managers, runtimes > epoch_managers, and also, stores > clients, epoch_managers > validators).\r\n   - Any override that is not explicitly provided will be constructed with a default (where N is the number of clients):\r\n     - stores will be default-constructed as N elements of `create_test_store()`.\r\n     - epoch_managers will be default-constructed as N elements of `KeyValueEpochManager` using the stores we have (this is why the stores must be finalized, either default-constructed or overridden, first, thus the partial order)\r\n     - shard_trackers will be default-constructed as N elements of `ShardTracker` using the epoch_managers we have, with empty tracking config.\r\n     - runtimes will be default-constructed as N elements of `KeyValueRuntime` using the stores and epoch_managers we have.\r\n   - In addition, there are helpers that allow overriding with something other than the default:\r\n     - `.track_all_shards()`: constructs shard_trackers that use the epoch_managers we have but with AllShards tracking\r\n     - `.real_epoch_managers()`: constructs epoch_managers as N `Arc<EpochManagerHandle>`s instead of KeyValueEpochManager\r\n     - `.nightshade_runtimes()` (this is an extension method that lives in integration-tests, to avoid a dependency cycle): constructs runtimes as N `Arc<NightshadeRuntime>`s using the stores and epoch_managers we have.\r\n   - As a result, most of the constructions in integration-tests have been converted to using only these helper functions, as opposed to constructing runtimes directly in the tests. Some tests outside of integration-tests still construct directly, which is OK as they used to do that as well; we just now have to make sure to override stores, epoch_managers, and runtimes together so they are consistent.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/8940/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":
