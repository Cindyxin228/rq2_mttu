Now, instead, there is just a model path, and all the models from that path are used unless an explicit list is provided.\r\n- Moves the changelog render tool out of `sdk-lints` and into its own independent tool. This new tool also has a `split` subcommand that is used to break SDK changelog entries away from smithy-rs changelog entries when a smithy-rs release is cut. The SDK release process then incorporates those split out entries the next time its code generator is updated. Entry duplication is avoided by tacking on a `since_commit` field for each SDK changelog entry when the logs are split.\r\n- Refactors the tools to have one shared implementation for interacting with Git, where there used to be two different implementations.\r\n- Adds a `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow that automatically releases smithy-rs upon workflow dispatch. This can be kicked off via GitHub CLI or through the website. It takes a `dry-run` input, which will produce release artifacts for inspection, but not cut the release and publish to crates.io if set.\r\n- Updates `sdk-sync` to use models from aws-sdk-rust rather than from smithy-rs.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Ran dry run releases for both aws-sdk-rust and smithy-rs with these changes and verified the artifacts to be published looked correct\r\n- Wrote the dry runs in such a way that they validate the secrets used so that when it comes time to do a real release, that aspect should be working\r\n- Verified tool/build changes are backwards/forwards compatible enough that `sdk-sync` doesn't break when syncing older/newer commits. This resulted in some TODO comments that will be addressed in https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/1493\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1495/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1495/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1478", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1478/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1478/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/1478/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1478", "id": 1278590685, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj846CYN5", "number": 1478, "title": "Add support for retrying individual call timeouts", "user": {"login": "rcoh", "id": 492903, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjkwMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/492903?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh", "html_url": "https://github.com/rcoh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rcoh/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-06-21T15:05:47Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-21T19:22:30Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-21T17:37:05Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/1478", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1478", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1478.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/1478.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-21T17:37:05Z"}, "body": "\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n- https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/558\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhen timeout support was added initially, the resulting error `SdkError::TimeoutError` was never added to the retry policy which prevented these errors from being retried.

Context\r\nAs we start unsynchronizing SDK crate version numbers, we will need to know exactly which crates went out with a given release so that if we need to yank that release, it will actually be possible. This PR revises SDK generation via the `sdk-sync` tool to feed information from the previous release's `versions.toml` into the creation of the next release's `versions.toml` so that this information of which crates actually changed can be retained.\r\n\r\nThe publisher tool was also modified to read an expected tag from the `versions.toml` file rather than expecting the `aws-config` version number. This will be required also since `aws-config`'s version number won't match the release tag in the future when versions aren't synchronized.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that you
