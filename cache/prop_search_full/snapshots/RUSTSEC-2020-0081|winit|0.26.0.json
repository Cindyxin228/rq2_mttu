I don't think there are any viable active alternatives to `web-sys` at the moment, although I know [@kettle11](https://github.com/kettle11) is working on [something](https://github.com/kettle11/kwasm) vaguely in that direction.\r\n\r\nI know you've stepped down from maintaining Winit, @ryanisaacg, but I'd appreciate it if you had any comments.
