https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/965\r\n\r\nPreviously, when spending signed resource, the user had to manually set `witness` indexes. This meant that the user had to pay attention on the signing order and  make sure to offset the index if some witnesses where already set.\r\n\r\nThis PR automates the whole process.\r\n\r\nProposed workflow:\r\n- wallet's `sign_transaction` now accepts a `TransactionBuilder`\r\n- when a wallet signs a `TransactionBuilder` the intention is saved in `UnresolvedSignatures`\r\n- when the user builds the transaction all signatures are resolved\r\n- after building the transaction can not be changed except with `append_witness` - this allows the user to add custom witnesses and it will not affect the `TxId`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, building a transaction will fail if there are signed resources that are missing corresponding signatures.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: \r\n- `send_transaction`, `dry_run`, `dry_run_no_validation` and `estimate_transaction_cost` need ownership of the `tx`.\r\n- removed witness index from `Input` and corresponding functions\r\n- wallet's `sign_transaction` now accepts a `TransactionBuilder`\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have added necessary labels.\r\n- [x] I have done my best to ensure that my PR adheres to [the Fuel

`ChainId`(`ConsensusParameters`). \r\n- Now tokens should be transferred to the contract first, and after you can transfer them via `SMO` or another transfer. So in some tests first we need to transfer money to the contract first.\r\n- Replaced all unsafe code from `fuel-crypto` with safe analog.\r\n- The `produce_blocks` function is updated and doesn't require `TimeParameters`.\r\n- On the `fuel-tx`/`fuel-core` side now, there is a difference in whether the message contains data. If data is empty, it is `MessageCoin` that acts like a `Coin`(has the same rules during execution). If the data field is not empty, then it is a retryable message(or `MessageData`). Messages like this can't be used to pay a transaction fee, and if the execution fails, the message is not consumed(you can use it again in the next transactions). More about them you can read in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/946. Also, the API changed for resources and not it is `Coins` again. Because of that, some tests now require messages with empty data to be able to spend them.\r\n- Removed redundant usage of `MessageId`. Now the identifier of the message is a `Nonce`.\r\n- Removed `Output::Message`. Now you don't need to specify it in the outputs. Because of that `SMO` opcode doesn't require a message output index anymore. \r\n- The proof API is updated with a new design: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1046. If you want to prove the block at height `X` you need at least a committed `X + 1` block.\r\n\r\nBecause some of opcodes were updated the examples require a new `sway`. The corresponding PR: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pull/4525. It creates a cycle of dependencies with this PR.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/829 https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/933\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGES: \r\n- `Predicate::set_provider` now returns a `Result` because it can fail if the \"new\" provider has different consensus parameters than the consensus parameters used previously\r\n- `Predicate` can be loaded with a provider by using `load_from_with_provider` and `from_code_and_provider`. The `from_code` and `load_from` remain, and use default `ConsensusParameters` value. This can be discussed further.\r\n- `Provider::new` now takes a `ConsensusParameters` argument, so we can avoid changing the API of downstream clients. \r\n- `setup_test_client` now returns `ConsensusParameters` of the client. This was either this or `setup_test_provider` would have to change, and the former is much less used than the latter.", "reactions": {"url":

issue for context. Only implementation notes to follow.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* `Abigen` code will now refer to types through the `fuels` package since it is now wasm compatible. @deekerno @ra0x3 the indexer should now just include `fuels` as a dependency taking care to disable the default features (since `std` is the default). You can access `fuels_core` stuff through `fuels::core`; `fuels_types` through `fuels::types`; `fuels_macros` through `fuels::macros`. \r\n\r\nThe hotfix is still in place -- mostly to make the Abigen code-writing experience more enjoyable. If we remove it completely then we'd have to do a `no_std` check whenever we use a Vec, `format!`, `String` etc. \r\n\r\nThis way we always write `::std::vec::Vec` and leave the rest to the (now smaller) wasm hotfix.\r\n\r\nAs we become more wasm compatible the rest of the `fuels-*` crates will become exposed through `fuels` reexports.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any
