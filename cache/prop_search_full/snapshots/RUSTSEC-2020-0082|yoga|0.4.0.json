benchmarking against Yoga, and this library would seem to be the obvious way to do it. However, it only seems fair to benchmark against the latest version of yoga. So I thought I'd try to see how hard it was to update (not that hard).\r\n\r\n- Upgrades yoga to commit [`35f3335efc88efced75aa1db1bb379cf0872831a`](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/commit/35f3335efc88efced75aa1db1bb379cf0872831a), which was the latest on the main branch as of 15th December 2022\r\n- Adds new `YGPositionStatic` variant to `YGPosition` enum (especially important because it's added to the start of the enum, renumbering the other variants)\r\n- Adds the Guttter type which maps to the new `YGGutter`\r\n- Adds `set_row_gap`, `get_row_gap`, `set_column_gap`, `get_column_gap`, `set_gap`, and `get_gap` functions to allow setting and getting gutters using (`YGNodeStyleSetGap` and `YGNodeStyleGetGap`).\r\n- Upgrades codebase to 2021 edition and fixes cargo warnings.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 21 tests failing, which I haven't dug into too deeply. They all seem to be to do with absolute position, and they seem to be returning `NaN` which isn't great.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/54/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/54/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/56", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/56/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/56/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/56/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bschwind/yoga-rs/pull/56", "id": 1503417020, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBZiOhs5FzsGX", "number": 56, "title": "Release/0.4.0", "user": {"login": "nicoburns", "id": 1007307, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDczMDc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007307?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns", "html_url": "https://github.com/nicoburns", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nicoburns/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-12-19T18:55:53Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-22T04:23:19Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-20T07:05:08Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/pulls/56", "html_url": "https://github.com/bschwind/yoga-rs/pull/56", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bschwind/yoga-rs/pull/56.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bschwind/yoga-rs/pull/56.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-20T07:05:08Z"}, "body": "Now that we've successfully updated yoga, I'm hoping we can get a new version published to crates.io.
