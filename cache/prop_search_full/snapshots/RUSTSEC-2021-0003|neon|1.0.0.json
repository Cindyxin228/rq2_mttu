The specification only defines serial execution and not necessarily single threaded execution.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this will always be one thread. V8 makes heavy usage of TLS and it would be a large lift to start doing things differently.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes Neon to _optimistically_ assume the runtime will always execute from the same thread. As a small level of protection, I added `SendWrapper` when `debug_assertions` are enabled.

These features all have accepted RFCs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, feature flags that are *only* used for the `legacy` backend are commented as deprecated. This will serve as a note to remove when removing the `legacy` backend.\r\n\r\n## Alternative\r\n\r\nThis PR *completely* removes the feature flags. This is a breaking change that will require users to remove the feature flag when upgrading.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Neon could only remove *usages* of the feature flag, but keep the flag in `Cargo.toml` for backwards compatibility, deferring the breaking change to a later release.\r\n\r\n## Follow-up\r\n\r\nThe `enable-static-tests` feature flag should also be removed.

values on the JavaScript heap. They are both `Send` and `Sync` to allow holding references across Rust threads. However, the current implementation has a soundness hole.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/843\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using [Node worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html), there may be multiple JavaScript runtimes present in the process. As shown in https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/843, it is possible to use a `Root` with a `Context` from the wrong runtime and cause a crash/undefined behavior.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the issue by panicking when attempting to dereference from the wrong module instance. In the future, we may want to add `try_` variants to the `Root` methods to allow error handling without a `panic`. However, in most cases, this will be a logic error that applications cannot recover.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nOn Node-API 6+, we use [instance data](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#environment-life-cycle-apis) to store a unique identifier initialized from a global counter. Each `Root` stores the identifier for comparing later when being used.\r\n\r\nOn previous versions, the [`ThreadId`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.ThreadId.html) is used. This may not be as robust and is sensitive to V8 implementation details.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/847/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/847/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/814", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/814/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/814/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/814/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/814", "id": 1031664251, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAoyP184tc-H7", "number": 814, "title": "Use syn-mid instead of syn + \"full\"", "user": {"login": "jrose-signal", "id": 72036507, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDM2NTA3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72036507?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal", "html_url": "https://github.com/jrose-signal", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrose-signal/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-10-20T17:37:18Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-21T16:42:01Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-21T15:22:08Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/pulls/814", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/814", "diff_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/814.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/814.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-21T15:22:08Z"}, "body": "Neon's use of syn is for the `#[neon::main]` macro, but that doesn't actually have to parse the function body to do its work.
