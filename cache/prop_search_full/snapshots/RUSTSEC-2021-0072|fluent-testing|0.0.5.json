line is https://hg.mozilla.org/try/file/3d5d1b1619ed5d6496e6b0dd2a40a07af5d01699/intl/l10n/rust/localization-ffi/src/lib.rs#l152\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of the crash seems to be that there is a call to `add_resource_id` while an async `format_messages` is being executed.\r\n\r\nI am able to reproduce the crash locally if I apply the patchset and run the incriminated test with `--verify`.\r\n\r\nI am not clear on how multi-threaded Gecko processes are and in what scenario a single document's Localization can be executing `format_messages` and in the middle call `add_resource_id`.\r\n\r\nIt may be there this is some flaw fixable with a switch from Rc to Arc, maybe? Or it may be that this is an inherent flaw in `fluent-fallback`.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the way we handle that in JS implementation is that we generate the cached iter/stream, and use it for all calls until the state is updated (state = sync + res_ids). When that happens, we regenerate the iter/stream and the next call to `format_messages` will use that, but the \"old\" ones that were in the middle when the state update happened will continue to use the old iter/stream.\r\n\r\nThat seems to be *really* hard to reproduce in Rust because we went far into no-alloc land which means that the `format_messages` relies on `FluentBundle` being allocated in `Localization`'s cache, and that, in turn, requires that the iter/stream remains available until `format_messages` ends.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I did a poor solution to the problem - I keep the old iter/stream, and add a \"new\" one on top to a ChunkVec. This allows me to use the new one in the consequitive calls, while the old one remains available for calls that used it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm missing is some way of expressing that when nothing requires the old one anymore (all `format_message` calls that relied on it completed), I'd like to drop it to avoid accumulating memory.\r\n\r\nI tried several approaches with Rc/Weak but that didn't work well with the `Cow`'s returned from the method.\r\n\r\nI'm not even sure if this is a sound approach, but I'd like to dump it here and ask for help in evaluating whether this is the right approach to resolve the issue.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/projectfluent/fluent-rs/issues/228/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0,
