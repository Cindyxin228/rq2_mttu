At this time, I don't even know where to start w/ that, so any pointers would be most welcome.\r\n -  [x] The bulk editing feature is not implemented; I am voting :hand: for us to review this as is and add that later, though I'm also fine to push on to work on bulk editing now if you'd prefer.\r\n -  [x] During my latest read through, I decided that we should probably a \"footer\" message to the `$EDITOR` akin to the default `commit` message from `git`. I'll work on this soon.\r\n -  [x] I'd like to take another look through my error handling and borrow/clone/dereferencing/option/basically/everything usage again.\r\n\r\nI *think* that covers most of it, but I'm sure I'm missing something! :smile:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Original PR description below:**\r\n\r\nStill *very* draft, but it's working for all of the use-cases that [I mentioned on #179](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/issues/179#issuecomment-1071087014), except for the fancy bulk editing case. That is to say:\r\n\r\n - Reword single or multiple commits within or across subtrees.\r\n - Currently, the same message is applied to all commits.\r\n - If multiple message flags are given on the CLI, they are combined into separate paragraphs.\r\n - If no message flags are passed on the CLI, `$EDITOR` is opened w/ either the message of the commit being reworded (if just rewording a single commit) or a stub message when rewording multiple commits.\r\n - Prompt for confirmation when appling the same message to multiple commits. (`--force` flag skips confirmation.)\r\n - Bails out if the edited message is identical to the input message, or if it's blank.\r\n\r\nSo, lots to love there already, but still lots to do:\r\n\r\n -  I'm still *very much* learning my way through Rust, so expect lots of :man_facepalming: moments if you're brave enough to read through this, especially when it comes to borrowing, scope and such.\r\n - This is very \"happy pathy\" right now. I need to go back and flesh out the error handling.\r\n - ~~For expediency, I implemented this by altering `r#move::r#move` (rewording is kind of just a special case of moving, at least, it seems so to me) but I just did that so that I could focus on the fun parts and not get bogged down trying to figure out the plumbing. (It's just a 4 line change in `r#move`.) I intend to break this entanglement and move the actual rebase planning into `reword`, but it's still in place at this time. Because of this, though, it's doing a restack/smartlog for every subtree that's being reworded, instead of just doing a single restack and smartlog at the end.~~ **Edit:** I've removed the coupling w/ `r#move` and rewritten the rebase planning and execution based on `sync`.\r\n - Also note that I did not implement this via a new `RebaseCommand`,. eg `RebaseCommand::Reword`. Instead I just updated`RebaseCommand::Pick` to support an optional message since a reword is just a pick but with a different message and the change was trivial. I'm inclined to leave this in place unless you feel otherwise.\r\n - B/c reword is treated as just a special case of `move`, I wanted to reuse all of the normal `MoveOptions`, *but* I wanted to reserve the shorthand `-m` flag for `--messages`, not for `merge` as in `MoveOptions` ... so I just duplicated `MoveOptions` into `RebaseOption` except w/o the `-m` flag. This is still TBD, but I'd like a way to just reuse `MoveOptions` while overriding the binding of `-m`, but I haven't delved into how/if this can be done in clap.\r\n - I haven't done anything to look at @epage request that it [operate independent of `branchless init`](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/issues/179#issuecomment-955109646). At this time, I don't even know where to start w/ that, so any pointers would be most welcome.\r\n - Bulk editting? I wonder if bulk editing might be best considered a feature unto itself. If so, this existing command could be finished off and proper bulk editing support (ie different messages for different commits) could be handled via a separate PR.\r\n\r\nI'm going to park this here for a bit while I go away and read more about borrowing, Boxes, memory mgmt, error handling etc in Rust. :smile: I hesitate to even ask for input yet, but I think it would be good to know if I'm heading in the right direction or not. (And of course even if I'm way off base and this is just totally not viable, it was still a fun learning exercise!)\r\n\r\nOh, and I *totally* used this to squash all of my ugly working commits. This is a slightly edited version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u276f ./target/debug/git-branchless reword --message 'hacking on `reword`' <base commit on branch>\r\n\u276f ./target/debug/git-branchless reword
