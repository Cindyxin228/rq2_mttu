Now backends are expected to\r\nprovide publishing and consuming together at the same time.\r\n\r\nMost of this code is adapted from the private crate standard-hedwig,\r\nwhich has been a proving ground for the publishing API before it could\r\nbe incorporated into this open-source crate, and has seen effective\r\noperation in production.\r\n\r\n~There are still some changes to follow in later commits to finalize the\r\nAPI before publishing as a major release, as noted in some of the source\r\ncomments.
