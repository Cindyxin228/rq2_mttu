The tool installation should probably be safeguarded behind a mutex of some kind to avoid this. I would say that is a separate issue that may be tackled in another PR?\r\n  -  In the end I had to implement it as part of this PR as 2 pipelines tried to download and extract files to the same location at the same time, leading to errors. That part is the `AppCache` struct and related changes, pushed as separate commit.\r\n- [ ] Windows UNC path are still an issue. `dart-sass` doesn't support them and we already use `dunce` to resolved to old-style Windows path, but there is still a chance that it results in UNC paths and then the pipeline will fail. Probably error handling around that area should be improved to make error messages clearer?\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/224/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/224/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221", "id": 962944487, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzA1NjYwMjcz", "number": 221, "title": "Add hooks", "user": {"login": "techninja1008", "id": 4208789, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDg3ODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4208789?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008", "html_url": "https://github.com/techninja1008", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2021-08-06T18:08:19Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-20T01:48:31Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-20T01:48:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/pulls/221", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221", "diff_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-20T01:48:30Z"}, "body": "Hi all.

The main takeaway is that we now have two kinds of `dist` directory: staging and final. Plugins should output to staging, and Trunk itself moves things from staging to final. In theory, a plugin could put files in final itself which is pretty undesirable. If we move to untrusted plugins, this might be a good action to restrict.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [ ] Updated README.md with pertinent

such:\r\n`<link data-trunk rel=\"rust|sass|...\" data-attr0 data-attr1/>`.\r\nThe links may appear anywhere in the HTML and Trunk will process them and\r\nreplace them or delete them based on the associated pipeline's output.\r\nIf the link element does not have the `data-trunk` attribute, it will not\r\nbe processed.\r\n\r\nThe `--manifest-path` flag has been removed in favor of the new link\r\nstyle: `<link data-trunk rel=\"rust\" href=\"path/to/Cargo.toml\"/>`. This is optional,\r\nand will default to the Cargo.toml of the source HTML's parent dir if\r\nnot specified.\r\n\r\nUpdate README describing new asset pipeline declaration pattern.\r\n\r\ncloses #50\r\ncloses #72 \r\n\r\n### todo\r\n- [x] ensure HTML pipelines replace their source HTML element. If declared in the `head`, then it should be replaced there, if declared in the `body` then it should be replaced there.\r\n- [x] update README describing new functionality.\r\n- [x] update README to clarify that when `data-trunk` links are processed, their HTML will be replaced based on where they exist in the DOM. So if links need to appear in the HTML body for including the WASM/JS, adding the `data-trunk` link to the HTML body will solve that problem.\r\n- [x] update docs for `rust-worker` asset type. The `href` attr should behave exactly as it does for the `rust` asset type.\r\n\r\n### for anyone willing to review\r\nPlease take a look at [the rendered README file](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/blob/804c3909f395b0f6db0472a90c542078b6dd8efd/README.md). The main thing which needs review/feedback here is the pattern which I've landed on for declaring assets (which is mostly discussed in the **assets** section of the README).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/73/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/73/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/67", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/67/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/67/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/67/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/67", "id": 712995024, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk2Mzg2ODUy", "number": 67, "title": "Fix deps to work with CI cache.", "user": {"login": "thedodd", "id": 2380740, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzODA3NDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2380740?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd", "html_url": "https://github.com/thedodd", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedodd/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-10-01T16:24:04Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-01T18:59:19Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-01T18:59:15Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/pulls/67", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/67", "diff_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/67.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/67.patch", "merged_at": "2020-10-01T18:59:15Z"}, "body": "Really shouldn't have to be doing this ...
