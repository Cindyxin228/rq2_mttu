"merged_at": "2025-07-15T13:21:09Z"}, "body": "This PR changes snarkOS to build using LLD on Linux. Doing this is generally faster than using GCC's linker, as shown in [this (slightly outdated) blog post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/17/enabling-rust-lld-on-linux/). We already require LLVM to build RocksDB, so using LLVM's linker should not create many headaches. \r\n\r\nThe expected performance improvements by this change are mostly due to LLD being multithreaded. At a first glance, the CI runs for this PR are 1 to 2 minutes shorter than previous runs, but the benefits of a faster linker will be more noticeable during release builds.\r\n\r\nThere is a push to change the default for Rust to LLD, but, in my opinion, we should not wait and just switch now as linking snarkOS is quite slow and that slows down development. As discussed in [this Rust issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71515), people already widely use LLD as a linker for their Rust projects without any problems.\r\n\r\nThe PR also changes the devnet CI to a slightly longer timeout, as I noticed it fail sometimes.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we can also consider switching to LLD for macOS, which I already did on my MacBook a few months ago. However, it might be good to do one at a time, in case something breaks.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3731/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3727", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3727/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3727/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3727/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3727", "id": 3227160677, "node_id": "PR_kwDODlztYM6et7d9", "number": 3727, "title": "Simplify BlockSync", "user": {"login": "kaimast", "id": 4525445, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjU0NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4525445?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast", "html_url": "https://github.com/kaimast", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-07-14T02:31:04Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-14T20:36:58Z", "closed_at": "2025-07-14T20:36:57Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pulls/3727", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3727", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3727.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3727.patch", "merged_at": "2025-07-14T20:36:57Z"}, "body": "### Removes the dedicated responses map\r\nThis part simplifies the BlockSync code a lot because we do not need to update two maps when removing requests.\r\nOne limitation is that `has_pending_responses` is now slower, but it is only called once every sync iteration.\r\n\r\n### Merges `check_block_response` and `insert_block_response`\r\nBy merging these two functions, we avoid potential race conditions as, because, before, each locked the requests map independently.

In this case, setting the filter to, for example, `--verbosity=6` creates significantly more log messages than needed. That can create a lot of unnecessary data for tools like Elasticsearch and makes it more cumbersome to search the logs later.\r\n\r\n## New Filter Flag\r\nThis PR adds a `--log-filter` flag, that can be set instead of `--verbosity`. The log filter flag, essentially, works like setting `RUST_LOG`. If you, for example, only want to all show logs related to the BFT crate but nothing else, you can start a node like this `snarkos start --log-filter=off,snarkos_node_bft=trace`.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\nThe PR also cleans up CLI some more. I removed a top-level `verbosity` flag that is not used anywhere. I also (re-)added the `suggestions` and `usage` features, so that the displayed help information is more useful. Finally, I bumped the `colored` crate to version `3.0.0`.\r\n\r\nThe top-level help now looks like this. Note the changed description from the updated `description` field in `Cargo.toml`.\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"snarkos --help\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3a58557-bd66-43df-b1d8-fd4fd5c31f8d\" />\r\n\r\nThe final commit of the PR ([cf81b0f](https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3707/commits/cf81b0f1e0a75be7435a8db18eca6d3c52641418)) adds some missing colors, such as for invalid commands and suggestions. It now looks like this: \r\n<img width=\"439\" alt=\"snarkos suggestion\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73170d07-203a-4caf-84c7-981eaf71326e\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The authors flag for CLI is also sourced from `cli/Cargo.toml` now, but clap `4.*` does not display author information unless one specifies a custom help template. See [this note](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.author) on the clap documentation for details.\r\n* We should consider merging `snarkos` and `snarkos-cli`.

When a new block is received or created, nodes update the block locators in `Ping`, which immediately sends new ping messages.\r\nThis should reduce block propagation time, as the old approach introduces up to 20 seconds of delay for each network hop.\r\n\r\nEvery iteration, Ping's worker task waits on a `tokio::Notify` (similar to a condition variable), which gets notified whenever the block locators change. It also set a timeout to the earliest time we have to send a new ping message to a peer.\r\nIf there are a no peers, the task still wakes up every 20 seconds. The latter should not be needed, but I left it in place to make sure the task never gets stuck.\r\n\r\nThis change also moves the `Writer` implementation from `Validator`/`Client`/`Prover` to `Router`, which deduplicates some code and also makes the code more modular.\r\n\r\n## Notes/Considerations\r\n* This change means we now send a ping every block, so roughly every 4 seconds or so. This could cause issues, and we can consider changing it to not trigger a new ping message on every block. I also have ideas to make `BlockLocators` smaller so that Ping messages do not cause a noticeable overhead.\r\n* I did not change the `Gateway`/`PrimaryPing` code. The `PrimaryPing` is really only used during initial sync. During normal operations, validators build blocks themselves and the pings do not affect latency.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\nClient block height is now identical to that of validators.\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-06-22 at 6 14 34\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78f8dc7f-a021-4f47-afea-1463ccc063f1\" />\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3678/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3678/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3672", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3672/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3672/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3672/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3672", "id": 3114149806, "node_id": "PR_kwDODlztYM6Y1XuV", "number": 3672, "title": "[Feat] Optional constant JWT", "user": {"login": "ljedrz", "id": 3750347, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTAzNDc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3750347?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz", "html_url": "https://github.com/ljedrz", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ljedrz/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2025-06-03T14:10:21Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-04T13:51:27Z", "closed_at": "2025-06-04T13:51:26Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pulls/3672", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3672", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3672.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3672.patch", "merged_at": "2025-06-04T13:51:26Z"}, "body": "A revival of https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3592.

I used `cargo machete` to determine which dependencies are unused. While unused code is removed at link-time, removing them outright reduces compile times slightly and decreases the size of `Cargo.toml` files. \r\n\r\nThe second commit also adds a CI job that runs `cargo machete` to detect any unused dependencies on new commits to prevent future bloat. We can only merge the first commit if we decide to not automatically test for unused dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Notes and \"Future Work\"\r\nThere are a few places (mostly the top-level snarkOS crate) where we add indirect dependencies as direct dependencies, solely to enable features on them.\r\nMost of these superfluous dependencies are not needed. For example, `snarkos` depends on `snarkos-node` so it can enable the `locktick` feature on it. But that feature is also enabled by `snarkos-cli` which actually uses the `snarkos-node` dependency.\r\nHowever, I did not want to add any more changes to this PR, so I simply set some dependencies to be ignored by `cargo machete` using the `package.metadata.cargo-machete.ignored` field in `Cargo.toml`.\r\n\r\nThere is also a feature on `snarkos-node` called `parallel` that does not seem to be used anywhere, but I did not want to remove it in this PR either.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3644/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3644/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3639", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3639/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3639/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3639/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3639", "id": 3074401248, "node_id": "PR_kwDODlztYM6WwQJo", "number": 3639, "title": "[Release] Mainnet `v3.7.1`", "user": {"login": "raychu86", "id": 14917648, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE3NjQ4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14917648?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86", "html_url": "https://github.com/raychu86", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/raychu86/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 7073197838, "node_id": "LA_kwDODlztYM8AAAABpZhvDg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/labels/release", "name": "release", "color": "6edbc1", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 8639836829, "node_id": "LA_kwDODlztYM8AAAACAvlynQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/labels/3.7.1", "name": "3.7.1", "color": "E7B3BD", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-05-19T16:25:58Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-19T17:35:06Z", "closed_at": "2025-05-19T17:35:04Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pulls/3639", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3639", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3639.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3639.patch", "merged_at": "2025-05-19T17:35:04Z"}, "body": "<!-- Thank you for filing a PR!

Increase participation leniency for certificates to be every two rounds rather than every round.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3628/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3628/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3626", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3626/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3626/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3626/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3626", "id": 3044432671, "node_id": "PR_kwDODlztYM6VMR_9", "number": 3626, "title": "Fix remaining synchronization bugs", "user": {"login": "kaimast", "id": 4525445, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjU0NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4525445?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast", "html_url": "https://github.com/kaimast", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaimast/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-05-07T01:38:47Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-12T20:42:57Z", "closed_at": "2025-06-12T20:42:57Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pulls/3626", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3626", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3626.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3626.patch", "merged_at": "2025-06-12T20:42:57Z"}, "body": "This PR reverts the revert of PR #3543 and fixes two issues we detected during stress tests. \r\n\r\nThe changes are structured as follows:\r\n\r\n* [db40b35](https://github.com/kaimast/snarkOS/pull/3/commits/db40b35d8d8ef374ea5970878c76b106560fd442) reverts the revert (undos commit). These changes have already been reviewed for the reverted PR.\r\n* [7f6762b](https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3626/commits/7f6762b4bd4d1e951013afe3f0a2cc31f6b77c61) ensures that, for validators, BFT's sync module processes new blocks, instead of them being processed by the generic BlockSync module.\r\n* [434a406](https://github.com/kaimast/snarkOS/pull/3/commits/434a406a97b40821e8e5d49704a6b6a543ea97e8) fixes another bug, that is unlikely to happen on mainnet but popped up during stress testing (see the description on \"pending blocks\" below).\r\n\r\n## Pending Blocks\r\nCurrently, validators have two different sync modes. For older blocks (>=100 rounds ago) they sync like clients performing only some of the DAG checks, for more recent blocks (<100 rounds ago) validators check that there are enough votes for each new block's leader certificate in some subsequent block. This check happens in `snarkos_node_bft::sync::sync_storage_with_block`.\r\n\r\nChecking for sufficient votes means that, in addition to blocks added to the ledger, there is also a set of \"pending blocks\" which cannot be added to the ledger yet because they did not reach the availability threshold yet.\r\nThe generic BlockSync module, however, is unaware of these pending blocks which can cause issues, as outlined below.\r\n\r\n### Detected Issue and Proposed Fix\r\nIn the common case, there is only one pending block. However, during stress testing we triggered a case where a majority of validators restart after resetting their ledgers, and the most recent block did not receive sufficient votes. Here, there exists a block `i-1` and a block `i`, where block `i` does not contain sufficient votes for `i-1`.\r\nUsually, a subsequent block, here w.l.o.g. block `i+1`, contains sufficient votes to add all its pending predecessors to the ledger.\r\n\r\nThe issue we found is that, in this scenario, BlockSync considers itself more than one block behind and, thus, not fully synced. The network then cannot make progress to create block i+1 because most validators are still syncing, but without `i+1` block `i-1` never gets added to the ledger.\r\nThe final commit in this PR considers pending blocks as part of the sync state to address this.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\nWe already ran stresstests on this branch and did not detect any errors. However, I want to perform another run of stresstest to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThere is a larger PR in the works to perform the checks on pending blocks on all nodes, not just validators, and move more of the DAG checks into snarkVM. However, I want to merge this version first, as the delta to the last PR is fairly small, and the larger PR requires more extensive testing and benchmarking.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3626/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3626/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3612", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3612/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3612/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3612/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3612", "id": 3024480550, "node_id": "PR_kwDODlztYM6UJLa0", "number": 3612, "title": "fix: missed version update", "user": {"login": "joske", "id": 532423, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjQyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532423?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske", "html_url": "https://github.com/joske", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-04-28T10:27:38Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-28T12:31:45Z", "closed_at": "2025-04-28T12:31:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pulls/3612", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3612", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3612.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3612.patch", "merged_at": "2025-04-28T12:31:45Z"}, "body": "<!-- Thank you for filing a PR!

Help us understand by explaining your changes. Happy contributing! -->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Message::Version used in the router to be based on a rolling migration. This allows for smoother behavior whenever there is a breaking migration that requires nodes to upgrade versions. The intention is to allow the following:\r\n\r\n1. At block height `X`, the protocol upgrades to message version from `Y-1` to `Y`.\r\n2. Client A upgrades and starts using message version `Y`.\r\n3. Client B has not upgraded and still uses message version `Y-1`.\r\n4. Until block `X`, they stay connected and can communicate.\r\n5. After block `X`, Client A will reject messages from Client B.\r\n\r\nThis behavior will allow smoother upgrades by allowing client nodes to stay connected and process blocks up until the actual migration height rather than immediately after peers upgrade. \r\n\r\nNote that this does not touch Validator's `Event::Version` because we want those to stay fixed and in lock-step, at least until this change is fully tested.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nBasic validator + clients devnet has been run locally, but more extensive testing needs to be done to test general cases. A couple to consider are:\r\n\r\n- Local network\r\n  - [x] Client nodes + Prover nodes with this PR @kpandl \r\n- Canary network\r\n  - [x] this PR snarkOS client @kpandl \r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3596/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3596/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3589", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3589/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3589/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/issues/3589/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3589", "id": 2982221938, "node_id": "PR_kwDODlztYM6R6pI6", "number": 3589, "title": "chore: cargo update", "user": {"login": "joske", "id": 532423, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjQyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532423?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske", "html_url": "https://github.com/joske", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joske/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 8435238212, "node_id": "LA_kwDODlztYM8AAAAB9seFRA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/labels/v3.7.0", "name": "v3.7.0", "color": "02AA38", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-04-09T09:40:31Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-11T14:20:16Z", "closed_at": "2025-04-11T11:56:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pulls/3589", "html_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3589", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3589.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ProvableHQ/snarkOS/pull/3589.patch", "merged_at": "2025-04-11T11:56:30Z"}, "body": "<!-- Thank you for filing a PR!
