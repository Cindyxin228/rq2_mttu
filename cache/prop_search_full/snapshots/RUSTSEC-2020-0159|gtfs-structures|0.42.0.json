Most implementions of schedule parsers, such as Google Maps, likely do not store the entire dataset. I attempted to do that and it wound up being over 200 GB for the entire world. Implementations typically store the difference between each stop as an itinerary, and then trips are referenced via an offset to the itinerary.
