`async` well at all. There are some blocking I/O operations deep in the core, and any libraries that people want to pull into their builders that require a full runtime like Tokio will not work at all, because everything comes down to a `futures::executor::block_on` at present.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that issue by bringing in Tokio at the top level and making all core operations (particularly in the stores and translations manager systems) fully asynchronous. This should allow using more complex libraries and code in builder functions, and should also enable potentially large performance gains for apps that build many pages from a single template (as that is now all done in parallel). Additionally, this makes the Perseus server far more resilient and logical.\r\n\r\nAstoundingly, none of this actually constitutes a breaking change, though plugin developers will have to ensure that their systems are `Send`able (which shouldn't pose a problem for most, and there's only one publicly available plugin in existence at present).", "reactions": {"url":
