serialisation, and stop dependants from using internal-only interfaces. `HumanBinaryData` won't provide these interfaces, so it needs to make do.\r\n\r\n* Make `Base64UrlSafeData.0` (the inner `Vec<u8>`) private, like `HumanBinaryData`.\r\n\r\n  This switches over everything which used the inner field to using `From`, `Deref` or `::new()`. These interfaces are also available on `HumanBinaryData`, and makes the types pretty much interchangable.\r\n\r\n* Remove `impl Display for Base64UrlSafeData` (which converted the inner value into a Base64 string).\r\n\r\n  The alternative is to use `base64::Engine::encode`.\r\n\r\n* Remove `impl TryFrom<&str> for Base64UrlSafeData` (which attempted to parse strings as Base64).\r\n\r\n  The alternative is to use `base64::Engine::decode`.\r\n\r\n* Migrate `WinWrapper::new` to use owned types rather than pass-by-reference.\r\n\r\n  Most of the existing implementations made copies of that data, and callers don't need to clone anyway.\r\n\r\n- [ x ] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [ x ] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\n", "reactions":

policy](https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/blob/master/OpenSSL.md) is currently only \"enforced\" for `webauthn-authenticator-rs`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds OpenSSL version number checks to `attestation-ca` and `webauthn-rs-core` using `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`. Every other package in this repo with an OpenSSL dependency depends on one of these two packages, so can be handled transitively.\r\n\r\nThis will make builds fail with OpenSSL v1.x, in line with [our OpenSSL policy](https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/blob/master/OpenSSL.md).\r\n\r\n## OpenSSL alternatives\r\n\r\nWe don't currently support OpenSSL alternatives, but I've attempted to avoid breaking them with this PR:\r\n\r\n- [BoringSSL sets `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER` to whichever it's targetting](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/HEAD/PORTING.md), so doesn't need special casing.\r\n- [LibreSSL always reports as \"OpenSSL v2\"](https://man.openbsd.org/OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER.3) (which doesn't exist), so I've set that as the minimum. It probably has similar bugs, but `rust-openssl` doesn't expose the LibreSSL version, and LibreSSL doesn't target parity with specific OpenSSL versions.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested with either.\r\n\r\n## What failures look like\r\n\r\nWhen building with outdated OpenSSL, this PR now makes it so you get a build-time error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: failed to run custom build command for

examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements the basic `webauthn-rs` command line that I mentioned in the discussion of issue #397.  The idea is that this wrapper can be used for debugging and experimentation.  It can also be used to implement `webauthn` in programming languages other than Rust.  This is simplified by passing JSON to and from the command-line process rather than using a foreign function interface.\r\n\r\nIf you run `make` under `tutorial/server/cli/`, you'll see the result of running the command line for the two steps of passkey registration and the two steps of authentication.  It's modeled after the `tutorial/server/tide/` example.\r\n\r\nUsing this wrapper, I've implemented, in some code that is still private, a webauthn registration and login system in the programming language Scheme, with a Javascript front end.  I've tested it with both a Yubikey 5C key and a Pixel phone passkey.\r\n\r\nI've included minimal documentation in the comments, but I'm happy to add more if you think this pull request is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for making `webauthn-rs` available.  Without it, implementing `webauthn` for a Scheme front end would have been vastly more work.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/414/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/414/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410", "id": 2061919255, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85jBsoz", "number": 410, "title": "Add fake credential generator interfaces", "user": {"login": "Firstyear", "id": 271005, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271005?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear", "html_url": "https://github.com/Firstyear", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2024-01-02T04:04:31Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T01:57:21Z", "closed_at": "2024-01-29T01:57:10Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/410", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410.patch", "merged_at": "2024-01-29T01:57:10Z"}, "body": "Fixes #362 -

There's also no way to detect at a `build.rs` level whether a binary target will be used for a test, and conditionally disable elevation support.\r\n\r\nThere's no tests in `fido-key-manager` anyway \u2013 so this just disables them explicitly so that a project-wide `cargo test` won't fail on Windows.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/358/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/358/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354", "id": 1918508026, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85bfzd2", "number": 354, "title": "Add \"HumanBinaryData\" as an alternative to \"Base64UrlSafeData\"", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-09-29T02:30:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:18:42Z", "closed_at": "2023-10-02T23:18:42Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/354", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354.patch", "merged_at": "2023-10-02T23:18:42Z"}, "body": "Related to issue #352, it **doesn't** fix things, but it's a start.\r\n\r\n`HumanBinaryData` uses a more efficient \"bytes\" format when using non-human-readable serialisation formats (like CBOR).  The deserialiser still uses `deserialize_any` \u2013 I haven't got a great way around this yet.\r\n\r\nI've done a few things differently to `Base64UrlSafeData`; for example, this doesn't implement `Display` or `FromStr` \u2013 they're different to what `Vec<u8>` does, and we should move away from this (this will be the focus of #356).\r\n\r\nIt also implements `Deref` and `DerefMut`, which should make the type more transparent \u2013 and all of the common impls are in macros.\r\n\r\nI've added `bytes` support to `Base64UrlSafeData`, so it can read what `HumanBinaryData` produces. Unfortunately this makes migration a two-step process.\r\n\r\nWhile we're here, this makes `serde_json` a dev-dependency of `base64urlsafedata`, because it's only used in tests; and this also adds a bunch more tests for expected input formats.\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Migrating to clap 4.x fixes this, so we can re-enable clippy in CI.\r\n\r\nclap 4.x has a few API changes, the main one for us was that it now the original struct field name as a field ID, rather than the \"normalised\" form (changing `_` to `-`), so `conflicts_with_all` and `ArgGroup`s need updating.  It also looks like some parts of clap only check argument definitions at runtime, and errors don't show up with `cargo test`; so we need to run those binaries manually with `--help` to discover errors.\r\n\r\nWhile here, I've done some house-keeping on many `webauthn-authenticator-rs` examples:\r\n\r\n* rename `authenticate/main.rs` to `authenticate.rs`\r\n* rename `cable_domain/main.rs` to `cable_domain.rs`\r\n* `cable_tunnel` example now uses `required-features` in `Cargo.toml`; so `cable_tunnel/main.rs` is gone, and effectively renaming `cable_tunnel/core.rs` to `cable_tunnel.rs`. This also fixes a broken link in the `cable-tunnel-server` README.\r\n* delete obsolete `nfc_token_info` example, as `fido-key-manager` can do the same thing\r\n* rename `softtoken/main.rs` to `softtoken.rs`\r\n\r\nFixes #313\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

this][4] is a little long, and has a few different issues, but the one that hits us here is that deriving `Default` on an `enum` with a generic type parameter forces `T: Default` regardless of whether that type used in the default case.\r\n\r\nAs a simplified example, `Foo<T>` implements something similar to `Option<T>`, and tries to derive `Default`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Default)]\r\nenum Foo<T> {\r\n    #[default]\r\n    None,\r\n    Some(T),\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nstruct Bar {\r\n    v: u8,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let a: Foo<Bar> = Default::default();\r\n    let b = Foo::Some(Bar { v: 1 });\r\n    \r\n    println!(\"{a:?}, {b:?}\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiling that with `rustc >= 1.62.0, <= 1.65.0` results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `Bar: Default` is not satisfied\r\n  --> ./defaults.rs:14:23\r\n   |\r\n14 |     let a: Foo<Bar> = Default::default();\r\n   |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Default` is not implemented for `Bar`\r\n   |\r\n   = help: the trait `Default` is implemented for `Foo<T>`\r\nnote: required for `Foo<Bar>` to implement `Default`\r\n  -->

additional warning that deriving `Default` for enums is experimental.\r\n\r\nIt compiles fine with `rustc >= 1.66.0`, so I've set the MSRV explicitly for `webauthn-rs-proto`. It's not clear which PR actually fixed this for `rustc`, and [the bug is still open][4]. \ud83e\udd37 \r\n\r\n`kanidm` already needs Rust 1.66.0.\r\n\r\nThe other packages can have their MSRV updated as things go.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vyx4oj/actionsrs_organization_became_unmaintained/ig54zv7/\r\n[1]: https://crates.io/crates/axum/0.6.1#user-content-minimum-supported-rust-version\r\n[2]: https://github.com/micolous/webauthn-rs/actions/runs/4684510868/jobs/8300730956\r\n[3]: https://github.com/micolous/webauthn-rs/actions/runs/4684549653/jobs/8300810953\r\n[4]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26925\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n- [ ] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [ ] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/301/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/301/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/300/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300", "id": 1663791658, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85OF-1s", "number": 300, "title": "Fix broken deviceplug commit due to force-push of dev branch", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-12T05:09:49Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:37Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:36Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/300", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/300.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-13T00:53:36Z"}, "body": "We were pinning a commit of `deviceplug` for a Linux-specific bug fix;

\\\r\n  -- \\\r\n  --serial-port /dev/tty.usbmodem \\\r\n  --softtoken-path /tmp/softtoken.dat \\\r\n  --qr-image ~/Desktop/screenshot.png \\\r\n  --tunnel-uri ws://localhost:8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nRelated fixing (which blocked this change):\r\n\r\n* only run `doctest` for features that are enabled\r\n\r\nPublic API changes:\r\n\r\n* `share_cable_authenticator()`'s parameters changed:\r\n  * added `options: ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions` parameter\r\n  * `tunnel_server_id` argument moved to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n  * `close_after_one_command` argument inverted to `stay_open_after_one_command`, and moved to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n  * added `tunnel_uri` field to `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions`\r\n\r\n* Added `connect_cable_authenticator_with_tunnel_uri` method for new feature.\r\n\r\n  This will probably be changed to use a `ConnectCableAuthenticatorOptions` struct like `ShareCableAuthenticatorOptions` once there's something else to put in there.\r\n\r\nInternal API changes:\r\n\r\n* `Eid::get_domain` replaced with `Eid::get_domain_builder`\r\n* `Eid::get_connect_uri` now (internally) public\r\n* Added `Eid::build_connect_uri` (internally public)\r\n* Added `Discovery::build_new_tunnel_uri` (internally public)\r\n* `Discovery::get_connect_uri` removed (use `Eid::get_connect_uri` instead)\r\n* Added `uri` parameter to `Tunnel::connect_authenticator`\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n",

[x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\nRather than just adding the `.html` and `.js` files to a new folder under _webauthn-rs/tutorial/frontend/javascript_, I've added 2 features (`wasm` and `javascript`) to the Axum example so it's easier to use either front-end. `wasm` is marked as a default feature. These features are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\naxum-extra is added as a dependency so the [SpaRouter](https://docs.rs/axum-extra/latest/axum_extra/routing/struct.SpaRouter.html) can be used. This also allowed me to simplify some of the code (e.g. remove `file.rs`).\r\n\r\nThe index_view() HTML has been moved into assets/wasm_index.html and I changed `/pkg/wasm_bg.wasm` to `/assets/wasm_bg.wasm` etc.\r\nThe rationale for this was I felt pkg doesn't really apply to HTML/Javascript, and I wanted to keep the directory names consistent.
