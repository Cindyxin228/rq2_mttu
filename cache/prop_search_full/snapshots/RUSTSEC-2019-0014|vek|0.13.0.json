Hopefully fixes #18.\r\n\r\nWaiting for your approval @icefoxen but of course, feedback from anyone else is appreciated!\r\n\r\nSo... This implements `mint` type conversions for `vek`'s types. Here is a list of what has NOT been done:\r\n- Conversions to non-square matrices (e.g `mint::RowMatrix2x3`), which I feel would add too much noise to the codebase. `mint` could actually implement such conversions between its own types.\r\n- Conversion from `Quaternion` to `mint::EulerAngles`. I also think `mint` could implement the conversion itself, if anybody really needs it??\r\n- Unit tests, because these conversions are trivial.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing that's ticking me: `mint` says that their quaternion type corresponds to a right-handed matrix. I might be mistaken, but it doesn't make sense to me; A quaternion has no assumed \"handedness\", the handedness is that of the application.\r\n\r\nPut another way: The result of quaternion multiplication is defined by that of the cross product, which doesn't care about handedness: `cross((1,0,0), (0,1,0)) == (0,0,1)` regardless of whether your `Z` goes \"forward\" or \"backwards\" in your application.\r\n\r\nI was asking myself \"uh, so, are my quaternions actually right-handed? Am I not breaking an invariant in mint by just passing the unchanged scalar and vector part?\", so if it turns out the question doesn't make sense, I won't need to worry.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n(by the way @icefoxen don't forget to add yourself to the list of contributors, if you feel like it.

https://github.com/yoanlcq/vek/commit/855bc9b6efca7cf99c27960122775c303baed2f4\r\n- semver is the standart in rust and it could be assumed that crates follow this for their dependencies.\r\n- especially in larger projects, having tilde dependencies increases the list of dependencies and duplicate versions.\r\n- even though vek frequently updates those, switching to caret version (at least for most crates) should be sufficient\r\n\r\nHi, i haven't found the reason why vek switched to tilde back in 2017, but maybe returning back to caret version might be a good thing", "created_at":
