Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a [line-wrap](https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap) crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n>   - `Base64Display` creation no longer uses a `Result` because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\n>   configs that `unwrap()` for you are no longer needed\n> - Add a streaming encoder `Write` impl to transparently base64 as you write.\n> - Remove the remaining `unsafe` code.\n> - Remove whitespace stripping to simplify `no_std` support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: `filter(|b| !b\" \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c\".contains(b)`.\n> - Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.\n> \n> # 0.9.3\n> \n> - Update safemem\n> \n> # 0.9.2\n> \n> - Derive `Clone` for `DecodeError`.\n> \n> # 0.9.1\n> \n> - Add support for `crypt(3)`'s base64 variant.\n> \n> # 0.9.0\n> \n> - `decode_config_slice` function for no-allocation decoding, analogous to `encode_config_slice`\n> - Decode performance optimization\n> \n> # 0.8.0\n> \n> - `encode_config_slice` function for no-allocation encoding\n> \n> # 0.7.0\n> \n> - `STANDARD_NO_PAD` config\n> - `Base64Display` heap-free wrapper for use in format strings, etc\n> \n> # 0.6.0\n> \n> - Decode performance improvements\n> - Use `unsafe` in fewer places\n> - Added fuzzers\n> \n> # 0.5.2\n> \n> - Avoid usize overflow when calculating length\n> - Better line wrapping performance\n> \n> # 0.5.1\n> \n> - Temporarily disable line wrapping\n></table> ...

https://github.com/openshift/cincinnati/pull/4#discussion_r225639618 by @crawford, suggesting to use future chaining.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR all methods return a `Result<Future..>` chaining them requires to `unwrap()` or slightly milder `unwrap_or_else()` for *every* additional chain element, which adds significant boilerplate for the consumer. This PR aims to aid with this by removing the outer `Result<Future..>` and return `Future..` for all async public methods.\r\n\r\nI'd like to discuss this API breaking change with the intention to move forward with this or a similar approach for the whole crate. I've done a rewrite of the login example demonstrates the usage of the changed API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n- [x] Rewrite *all of the* examples to use the new API\r\n- Rewrite examples to use chaining\r\n  -

permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n\n*Sourced from [base64's changelog](https://github.com/alicemaz/rust-base64/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md).*\n\n> # 0.10.0\n> \n> - Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a [line-wrap](https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap) crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n>   - `Base64Display` creation no longer uses a `Result` because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\n>   configs that `unwrap()` for you are no longer needed\n> - Add a streaming encoder `Write` impl to transparently base64 as you write.\n> - Remove the remaining `unsafe` code.\n> - Remove whitespace stripping to simplify `no_std` support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: `filter(|b| !b\" \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c\".contains(b)`.\n> - Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.\n> \n> # 0.9.3\n> \n> - Update safemem\n> \n> # 0.9.2\n> \n> - Derive `Clone` for `DecodeError`.\n> \n> # 0.9.1\n> \n> - Add support for `crypt(3)`'s base64 variant.\n> \n> # 0.9.0\n> \n> - `decode_config_slice` function for no-allocation decoding, analogous to `encode_config_slice`\n> - Decode performance optimization\n> \n> # 0.8.0\n> \n> - `encode_config_slice` function for no-allocation encoding\n> \n> # 0.7.0\n> \n> - `STANDARD_NO_PAD` config\n> - `Base64Display` heap-free wrapper for use in format strings, etc\n> \n> # 0.6.0\n> \n> - Decode performance improvements\n> - Use `unsafe` in fewer places\n> - Added fuzzers\n> \n> # 0.5.2\n> \n> - Avoid usize overflow when calculating length\n> - Better line wrapping performance\n> \n> # 0.5.1\n> \n> - Temporarily disable line wrapping\n></table> ...

Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a [line-wrap](https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap) crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n>   - `Base64Display` creation no longer uses a `Result` because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\n>   configs that `unwrap()` for you are no longer needed\n> - Add a streaming encoder `Write` impl to transparently base64 as you write.\n> - Remove the remaining `unsafe` code.\n> - Remove whitespace stripping to simplify `no_std` support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: `filter(|b| !b\" \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c\".contains(b)`.\n> - Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.\n> \n> # 0.9.3\n> \n> - Update safemem\n> \n> # 0.9.2\n> \n> - Derive `Clone` for `DecodeError`.\n> \n> # 0.9.1\n> \n> - Add support for `crypt(3)`'s base64 variant.\n> \n> # 0.9.0\n> \n> - `decode_config_slice` function for no-allocation decoding, analogous to `encode_config_slice`\n> - Decode performance optimization\n> \n> # 0.8.0\n> \n> - `encode_config_slice` function for no-allocation encoding\n> \n> # 0.7.0\n> \n> - `STANDARD_NO_PAD` config\n> - `Base64Display` heap-free wrapper for use in format strings, etc\n> \n> # 0.6.0\n> \n> - Decode performance improvements\n> - Use `unsafe` in fewer places\n> - Added fuzzers\n> \n> # 0.5.2\n> \n> - Avoid usize overflow when calculating length\n> - Better line wrapping performance\n> \n> # 0.5.1\n> \n> - Temporarily disable line wrapping\n></table> ...
