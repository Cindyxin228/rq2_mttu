added the CandidType, Serialize, and Deserialized traits to Status, in support of `dfx ping` to output json.\r\n\r\nHowever, Status isn't really appropriate for any of these.  The `values` map contains every field in the status.  But the other fields are populated during cbor deserialization.  It's true that technically, you could serialize a Status and then deserialize it, even to and from candid.  But when formatted to json, with the default serializer, a Status might look like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"impl_hash\": \"a380266e4b6977b7cce447aa5f784efdba0bb45820d51f39b9e7908f7fbb1aa1\",\r\n  \"replica_health_status\": \"healthy\",\r\n  \"root_key\": [ 48, 129, 130 ],\r\n  \"values\": {\r\n    \"certified_height\": {\r\n      \"Integer\": 948674\r\n    },\r\n    \"ic_api_version\": {\r\n      \"String\": \"0.18.0\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"impl_hash\": {\r\n      \"String\": \"a380266e4b6977b7cce447aa5f784efdba0bb45820d51f39b9e7908f7fbb1aa1\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"impl_version\": {\r\n      \"String\": \"0.9.0\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"replica_health_status\": {\r\n      \"String\": \"healthy\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"root_key\": {\r\n      \"Bytes\": [\r\n        48,\r\n        129,\r\n        130\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit f216c74cc1130ebb1654ab132e77994911f9eb34(https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs/pull/499).  We'll address the output of `dfx ping` in another way.\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThe reversion removed the related test.\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [x] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n",

Interface Specification change [IC-1462](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pull/143).\r\n\r\nWe need to do some changes in IC-Agent to handle HTTP responses with code 200 for `Call` requests as that indicates there is a CBOR encoded error message in the body.\r\n\r\nIt is a breaking change due to the enum variant `AgentErrror::ReplicaError` now being a tuple struct with attributes matching the new specification. \r\n\r\nFixes #421\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTwo integration tests have been added in `agent_test.rs` to test the flow where a call request is rejected with status code 200.\r\nPrevious tests for queries have also been updated where `AgentError::ReplicaError` is expected as a response.\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [x] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the
