this introduces dependency on `protoc` for compiling Protobuf files, previously `prost` library bundled `protoc` within the lib, but they've recently [moved away from that approach](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost/pull/657).\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n`libp2p` has made some breaking changes in recent updates, main change was [how you handle behaviour events](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/libp2p-swarm-0.38.0/swarm/CHANGELOG.md#0380) - this means that the Behaviour, in our case FuelBehaviour, would be stateless apart from holding other inner behaviours and all the stateful logic would be moved to FuelP2PService that holds the FuelBehaviour.\r\n\r\nUsually this would just mean a lot of cut & paste (check the `service.rs` and `behaviour.rs` files), but in our case FuelBehaviour was generic over a NetworkCodec, and leaving it still generic would imply that our FuelBehaviourEvent enum would also need to be generic which made for some unwieldy code. \r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to create a wrapper struct\r\n```rust\r\npub struct BehaviourEventWrapper<Codec: NetworkCodec> {\r\n    event: FuelBehaviourEvent,\r\n    codec: PhantomData<Codec>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nfrom this wrapper we would easily get the inner event and handle it in `FuelP2PService`.\r\n\r\nAlso now `FuelP2PService` needed to become generic over NetworkCodec since it's now the one that handles encoding and decoding of the network messages.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/661/reactions", "total_count": 0,

introduces the benchmarks for fuel-vm. It covers the first phase of #526 and targets individual instructions with the rocksdb/database backend.\r\n\r\nThis targets gas instrumentalization, so we skip benchmarking for predicate cases.\r\n\r\nThis uses a dedicated component of fuel-core so it will be easier to isolate and extend this component into block checking, and maybe to add some script to parse the output from criterion.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark is created from an isolated state of the VM that is ready to execute a given instruction. It is sub-optimal in the case of contract state & call since the call overhead will always be added to any instruction to be checked inside of a contract (i.e. SWW).\r\n\r\nAs next step, we need to make an API in fuel-vm to allow users to perform the operations of a call without executing the contract code. In other words, just load the contract code, add the call frame to the stack and prepare the registers.\r\n\r\nAfter this phase is complete, we need to benchmark beyond instructions to a block level so the post-execution steps (database commit, etc) is also accounted.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/616/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

In the future, we can use more advanced naming for fields,\r\ninstead of \"column-{i}\" because now we have names of cloumns=)\r\n\r\nIn some places, removed unnecessary usage of `Vec<u8>`(in `put`, `insert` etc methods).\r\nRemoved usage of `Clone` and `Copy` for some `value` in the same methods.\r\n\r\nPrepared the code for the next refactoring:\r\n- to simplify the implementation of

codebase was complaining.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, there is:\r\n- P2pService\r\n- NetworkOrchestrator which contains P2pService \r\n- Service which wraps the NetworkOrchestrator (I have named it `Service` to keep in line with other modules that had top level `Service`)\r\n\r\n### Creating the top level `Service`\r\nI have went and implemented a similar pattern for the network as our other Services have done, by adding `start()` and `stop()` methods.\r\n\r\nI have achieved that by wrapping the NetworkOrchestrator into a `Service` but I had to change some things:\r\n\r\n#### P2P Service and Network needed to shut down\r\nUnlike  some other simpler Services, once network `Service` was stopped, we needed to shut down the whole p2p network.\r\nI have achieved that by moving `p2p_service` from a `NetworkOrchestrator` field into a simple `variable` within `run()` method, so once `run()` ended (ie `stop()` was called) the `p2p_service` would go out of scope and get removed completely.\r\n\r\nAnd if `start()` was called again, a new `p2p_service` would be instantiated - I had to keep the p2p_config within the NetworkOrchestrator for this case.\r\n\r\n#### FuturesUnordered and their blocking of the executor\r\nWhile testing out `start()` and `stop()` I have discovered a bug in our NetworkOrchestrator.\r\n\r\nIt's field `outbound_responses` which was of type \r\n```\r\ntype ResponseFuture = Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Option<(OutboundResponse, RequestId)>>>>;\r\nFuturesUnordered<ResponseFuture>\r\n```\r\nonce called `next()` on it, it would return `None` so in our `loop { tokio::select!...` pattern it was constantly returning `None`\r\nwithout letting any other items to be polled, basically it was blocking the executor. I discovered this while adding tokio's `sleep` within a test, and it never got to finish! So I have changed this part of the code slightly by using tokio's channels instead of FuturesUnordered.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were few other changes and clean ups.", "reactions": {"url":
