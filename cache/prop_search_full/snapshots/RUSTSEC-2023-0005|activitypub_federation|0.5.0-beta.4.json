There's also no backpressure so  memory keeps building up. It's also not reliable and gets destroyed on process restart. It's been causing lots of issues for lemmy, even though it's been tweaked to be improved a fair bit by e.g @cetra3  .\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a method to send activities directly, without any queueing or retrying logic. The error handling is kept the same.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the activity queue. The intention is to replace the queue (in lemmy) with this: https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3605 . Parts of that code could *probably* be extracted to not be lemmy- and postgresql specific, but that's out of scope for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor applications that don't need reliability or large scale, you can still use `send_activity()` (without retries or parallelization) or implement your own parallel replacement by using a simple retry loop and a tokio JoinSet.\r\n\r\nSince the new queue always calls the `SendActivityTask::prepare` function with only a single inbox, this PR also adds caching to the private key instantiation - otherwise it would be instantiated once per target inbox. I added a config option for the size of this cache. It would be possible to move the cache outside this crate but then the openssl crate would have to become part of the public interface of this crate.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/issues/75/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/issues/75/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/issues/56", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/issues/56/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/issues/56/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/issues/56/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/pull/56", "id": 1785576633, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHb-6iM5Ufnmm", "number": 56, "title": "Fix regex error when actix-web feature not enabled", "user": {"login": "colatkinson", "id": 6528368, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjgzNjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6528368?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson", "html_url": "https://github.com/colatkinson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/colatkinson/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-07-03T08:01:32Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-03T13:05:19Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-03T13:05:18Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/pulls/56", "html_url": "https://github.com/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/pull/56", "diff_url": "https://github.com/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/pull/56.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust/pull/56.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-03T13:05:18Z"}, "body": "If the crate is built with only the axum feature, compiling the webfinger account regex will fail with an error \"Unicode-aware case insensitivity matching is not available...\" because of the missing unicode-case feature.

adds the functions\r\n\r\n- `bytes_limited`\r\n- `json_limited`\r\n- `text_limited`\r\n\r\nThese are all essentially wrappers around the stream returned by `bytes_stream`.  \r\n(Maybe this extension trait could be extracted into an own crate so the code doesn't have to be duplicated for eventual changes to lemmy?)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is an MSRV policy, if there is one: This PR
