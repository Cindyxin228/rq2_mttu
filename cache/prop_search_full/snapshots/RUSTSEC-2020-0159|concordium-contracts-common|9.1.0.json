It is desired to derive these traits, especially for types from our standards such as `PermitParam` from the CIS3 standard. To be able to derive it for `PermitParam`, the `AccountSignature` type misses such feature. We need to implement these traits on the signature types in `contracts-common` first.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Derive `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` on signature types:

Purpose\r\n\r\nThis PR adds generic adapters (as blanket implementation) to the ArkWorks interfaces. The adapters (with some additional configuration traits) are used to replace the BLS12-381 curve with ArkWorks implementation.  In addition to that, `ed25519-dalek` is upgraded to `v2.0`, which was previously blocked by the `pairing` crate and the corresponding BLS implementation (new versions don't expose the target group element type `Fp12`, preventing from serializing it, [see details here](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381/issues/96)). \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- implement `ArkGroup<G>` and `ArkField<F>` wrappers;\r\n- blanket implementations of the `Field` and `PrimeField` traits for `ArkField<F>`;\r\n- blanket implementation of  the `Curve` trait `ArkGroup<G>`;\r\n- all required trait implementations for the ArkWorks `BLS12-381` curve, that replaces the current BLS curve implementation from the `pairing` crate.\r\n- upgrade `ed25519-dalek` signature scheme; the `v2.0` API is a bit different, it bundles a secret and verifying (public) key into a signing key and maintains an invariant that the verifying key is always the public key of  secret_key; signing does not require passing the verifying key, so it was removed from parameters of the corresponding functions.\r\n- update FFI function types on the Haskell side to match the changes in the signing API (removed `verifing_key` parameter)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style of this project.\r\n- [x] The code compiles without warnings.\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of the changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my code, in particular the intent of the\r\n      hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/496/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/496/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/492", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/492/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/492/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/issues/492/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/492", "id": 2037898521, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFQNx-c5hzP2Z", "number": 492, "title": "Wallet library", "user": {"login": "orhoj", "id": 57264157, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjY0MTU3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57264157?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj", "html_url": "https://github.com/orhoj", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orhoj/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-12-12T14:40:41Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-15T10:59:54Z", "closed_at": "2023-12-15T10:59:53Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Concordium/concordium-base/pulls/492", "html_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/492", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/492.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-base/pull/492.patch", "merged_at": "2023-12-15T10:59:53Z"}, "body": "## Purpose\r\nMigrate wallet functionality from https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-node-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/rust-bindings to concordium-base.

interfaces) better suitable for adding new curve implementations. Add the `curve25519` implementation using the updated interface. Add benchmarks of the `curve25519` curve with our bulletproof implementation.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- add `Field` and `PrimeField` traits; the idea is that they contain only what we need and don't have extra dependencies; moreover, we can provide implementation for external type, which was not possible with `ff::Field`;\r\n- make it possible to override the generic `multiexp` algoritm implementation, if a certain curve provides an optimised version;\r\n- implement `Field`, `PrimeField` for the `BLS12-381` curve (including a blanket inplementation of `Field` for any `F : ff::Field`;\r\n- implement `Field`, `PrimeField` and `Curve` for The ristretto representation of `curve25519-dalek`;\r\n- add benckmarks:\r\n  - multiexp algorithms from `curve25519-dalek` exposed through our interface (authored by @hamiidreza);\r\n  - range proof performance  `curve25519`;\r\n  - ~~range proof from dalek's `bulletproofs` (authored by @hamiidreza).~~ (was exluded in the
