identified some places in the code that were using the `Key` type where it was statically known that the key would always be a `ContractHash` which made it annoyingly difficult to prototype changes

This change also made us realise that there was some unreachable code in the project, particularly in `RuntimeContext::remove_key` and `Account::extract_access_rights`.

thrust of this change is, delegator bids are stored as top-level entries in global state under a composite key instead of embedded in a collection within their applicable validator's bid; this allows each bid to be interacted with atomically and avoids the deep copy issue of embedded collections within a stored value. there is a downside; getting total stake for a validator, reporting, and distributing rewards requires a lot more reads. this can be mitigated by adding a lazy last-era in-mem cache, which I propose we do in a separate optimization PR.\r\n\r\nsecondarily, empty (0 balance) bids and slashed bids are now pruned from the global state pathing (will not be included under the newly calculated root hash); this reduces width of a slice of global state at the tip of the chain. \r\n\r\nthirdly, the unbond experience is simplified. an attempt to unbond an amount greater than stake previously resulted in an error. the logic has been changed to simply unbond all of the stake when the attempted amount is higher rather than error. adjacent to this, previously an attempt to fully unbond was complicated by the fact that we re-stake rewards. there is an edge case of a fully unbonded bid gaining stake again due to the end of era reward for their last, leading to \"dust\" in their bonding purse. the logic now instead applies the delayed reward payout to the appropriate unbonding purse avoiding this issue.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4196/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

`EntryPointAccess::Abstract` variant that marks the entry point export as exists in the wasm bytecode but is not callable.

changes the node to use `ExecutionJournal` in place of `ExecutionEffects`.\r\n\r\n`ExecutionJournal` has been moved to `casper-types` accordingly, and while the old `ExecutionEffects` type in `casper-types` has been retained for syncing and reporting of historical data, the equivalent type in EE has been removed.\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionJournal` also dropped the `Operations` field as this was unused and not populated, leaving the journal as simply a `Vec<Transform>`.\r\n\r\nThis work introduced a need for a new enum `ExecutionResult` holding old and new forms of execution results.  The `casper_execution_engine::engine_state::ExecutionResult` was updated to hold an `ExecutionJournal`, and we only need to support one flavour of this type, so it's not versioned.  However, the `casper_types::execution::ExecutionResult` became `casper_types::execution::ExecutionResultV1` and was otherwise structurally unchanged, as this is the type held in Storage and which is sent to other nodes/clients on demand.  The new `casper_types::execution::ExecutionResultV2` is equivalent to the updated `casper_execution_engine::engine_state::ExecutionResult` (with the difference continuing to be that the error type of the `casper_types` one is a `String` as `casper-types` has no access to EE error types).\r\n\r\nSince Storage had to be updated to hold the new `ExecutionResult`s, I also took the opportunity to fix the long-standing issue of multiple execution results being attributed to a single deploy.  There is now a 1-1 mapping of deploy to execution result.\r\n\r\nThis PR is blocked by [client PR #85](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-client-rs/pull/85), since CI will likely fail until the client is updated.\r\n\r\nCloses #2124.\r\nCloses [#160](https://github.com/casper-network/roadmap/issues/160).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4133/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4133/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4126", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4126/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4126/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4126/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4126", "id": 1803208901, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD7qsic5VbkPm", "number": 4126, "title": "Juliet crate", "user": {"login": "marc-casperlabs", "id": 63730123, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzMwMTIz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63730123?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs", "html_url": "https://github.com/marc-casperlabs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-07-13T14:54:41Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T10:11:30Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-31T16:16:39Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/4126", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4126", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4126.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4126.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-31T16:16:39Z"}, "body": "This is the first iteration of the `juliet` crate, as described in the [Juliet RFC](https://github.com/marc-casperlabs/juliet-rfc/blob/master/juliet.md).\r\n\r\n* Features: Complete in terms of API and implementation for everything that is the minimum for the 1.6 release.

Almost complete, should cover everything including usage.\r\n\r\nI will amend this PR with additional tests over the next few days, and potential bugfixes arising from them.\r\n\r\nI recommend reading

casper-types.\r\n\r\nAs part of that PR, two custom serializers in the `ExecutableDeployItem` enum were removed which shouldn't have been, meaning that parsing such an item which was stored e.g. by a 1.4.x node would fail.\r\n\r\nA further issue was that binary serialization of `casper-node::types::DeployHash` delegated to `Digest`, which delegated to `Vec<u8>` for legacy reasons.  When bincode-encoding such a `DeployHash` it has a length prepended to the serialized data.  This is still how the moved `DeployHash` is handled.  However, prior to the move, there was a `casper_types::DeployHash` which delegated to `[u8; 32]` for binary serialization.  Bincode does not prepend a length for a fixed-length array like this.  As such, to retain the ability to parse historical stored data which held an old `casper_types::DeployHash`, we need to provide helpers to use array-style encoding rather than Vec.\r\n\r\nCloses
