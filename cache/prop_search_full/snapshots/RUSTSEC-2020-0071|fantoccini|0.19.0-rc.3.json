Cookies](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#cookies) in the WebDriver spec. In particular, I've implemented the following operations:\r\n\r\n* Get All Cookies\r\n* Get Named Cookie\r\n* Delete Cookie\r\n* Delete All Cookies\r\n\r\nThe last operation, \"Add Cookie\", requires support from the `webdriver` crate.  The primary issue is that the `AddCookieParameters` struct does not implement `Serialize`, which means that we can't build the POST request on our side.  I'll be trying to get in touch with the geckodriver folks to see if this can be changed on their end.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a new module, `cookies.rs`.  This module contains the cookie-related `Client` methods as well as a few functions for converting between raw JSON (from WebDriver) and `cookie::Cookie` for the APIs.\r\n* Added a simple integration testcase that triggers the `get_all_cookies` and `delete_all_cookies` operations.\r\n* Removed the `binary` flag/arg when creating the WebDriver test client.  Both `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` are able to detect the path to the browser binary automatically on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nCloses #59.", "reactions": {"url":
