if available:* #747, #691\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:* This PR implements the layering RFC presented by @calavera in #747 with minor modifications to get the implementation running.\r\n\r\nNotes about the current implementation:\r\n\r\n- The public interface hardly changes: user handlers must now be `Send` and `'static` but that's it. Using the top-level `run` function should result in functionally (almost) equivalent code (except for some logging statements).\r\n- The now-public `Runtime` type adds a few internal layers upon initialization to (1) catch panics in user handlers, (2) transform user handler responses into Runtime API requests, and (3) send completion/error requests to the Runtime API. Users can add their own layers on top: the service input is a custom `LambdaInvocation` type which provides request-specific information along with the `Config` of the Lambda environment for convenience.\r\n- Some services could probably be implemented a little easier if one would accept that any services wrapped in the runtime implement `Clone`.\r\n\r\nI also added an example on how one could implement a custom layer to create OpenTelemetry spans and flush telemetry after each invocation, hence, this PR is also closely related to #691.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for originally outlining the implementation @calavera, that helped a lot! Please regard this PR as a proposal for implementation, I'm happy to make both minor and major adjustments. I mainly wanted to share this to further #747.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x]

changes:*\r\n\r\nTo support addtional event triggers in lambda web adapter, such as SQS or Bedrock Agents, we need to pass-through events from those triggers. This PR adds a `pass_through` feature to `lambda-http` crate. When enabled, the events payloads will be translated to a HTTP post request (event payloads in the request body). \r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the deserializer.rs. It uses `RawValue` to get the data from `deserializer`, not relaying on private serde functions. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under

and execute events related to Bedrock would be good for the user experience of Lambda Function.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have added a new Event sent from Agents for Amazon Bedrock based on the schema

Lambda extensions must be registered during the Lamba lifecycle Init phase, which ends when the runtime calls Next to await the first event. Since the `Extension::run` function both registers and executes the extension, there was previously no way for the runtime to determine that all internal extensions have been registered and that it's safe to proceed to the Invoke lifecycle phase.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces an `Extension::register` method that registers the extension and begins any logs/telemetry handlers. It then returns a new `RegisteredExtension` abstraction that can be used to invoke the extension's run loop concurrently with the runtime's run loop.\r\n\r\nThis change maintains backward compatibility by having the existing `Extension::run` method perform both steps. External Lambda extensions can use either API, and internal extensions should use the new API.\r\n\r\nResolves #743.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [X ] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [X ] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/744/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/744/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/732", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/732/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/732/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/732/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/732", "id": 2002670475, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs5f72s8", "number": 732, "title": "Remove function config allocations per invocation.", "user": {"login": "calavera", "id": 1050, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera", "html_url": "https://github.com/calavera", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/calavera/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-20T17:22:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-20T18:42:08Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-20T18:42:07Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/732", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/732", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/732.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/732.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-20T18:42:07Z"}, "body": "*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nEvery invocation clones the function config.
