This file has the correct version and date populated, as well as section headers. All that a maintainer needs to do is place the git log message content into one of the categories, then cut and paste into the real `Changelog.md`\r\n\r\n- The version of the crate is incremented using `cargo bump`.\r\n- The `README.md` of the crate is updated to the correct version.\r\n- For all other Ockam crates, dependencies on the releasing crate are updated.\r\n- Lockfiles are regenerated for all changed crates.\r\n- All crates are checked via `cargo check`  and  will fail on problems\r\n- Runs a final `gradle test_rust`.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
