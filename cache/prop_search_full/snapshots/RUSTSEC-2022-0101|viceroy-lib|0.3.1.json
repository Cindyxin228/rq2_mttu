"2022-08-19T20:44:12Z"}, "body": "This commit implements support for Object Store in Viceroy allowing for\r\nusers to simulate locally being able to query for blobs or add blobs to\r\nthe store. This commit does so with the following important changes:\r\n\r\n- Bump the version of the Rust SDK to 0.8.7 which contains support for\r\n  the Object Store with higher level APIs rather than having users use\r\n  raw host calls\r\n- Add config support to `fastly.toml` in the following format:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  [local_server]\r\n  object_store.empty_store = []\r\n  object_store.store_one = [{key = \"first\", data = \"This is some data\"},{key = \"second\", path = \"../test-fixtures/data/object-store.txt\"}]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  or alternatively with the following TOML syntax\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  [local_server]\r\n  [object_store]\r\n  empty_store = []\r\n  [[object_store.store_one]]\r\n  key = \"first\"\r\n  data = \"This is some data\"\r\n  [[object_store.store_one]]\r\n  key = \"second\"\r\n  path = \"../test-fixtures/data/object-store.txt\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Semantically these are the same and it comes down to style preference\r\n  as the TOML parsing should work the same.\r\n\r\n  `object_store` is a new field in the `local_server` config option. It\r\n  takes any string value which is the name of the object store. This\r\n  then contains an array of objects that contain a `key` field which is\r\n  the name of the object stored in the store and either a `path` *or* a\r\n  `data` key value not both. `path` points to a file relative to the\r\n  project root and data is a string of bytes. This lets the user either\r\n  point to some file, useful for cases where the file might be really\r\n  large, or inline if the data is small.\r\n\r\n  The object store must be defined in the `fastly.toml` file beforehand\r\n  as new Object Stores cannot be created on the fly, however data can be\r\n  inserted after opening the file. The store will maintain the state\r\n  across requests and will lose it when Viceroy is stopped.\r\n- Add Object Store hostcalls to Viceroy\r\n- Implement the Object Store hostcalls for Viceroy\r\n\r\nWith this users can now locally test their code as if they were running\r\nin production.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get this up to have a second pair of eyes, but the following are tasks I still need to finish up before getting approval. Note CI will fail until we release the new version of the SDK.\r\n\r\nTODO List before merging:\r\n-[x] Add validation checks for the object key names\r\n-[x] Test more aspects of the SDK/Object Store\r\n\r\ncc: @JakeChampion since you were working on the JS SDK support I figured you'd also want to kick the tires with this!", "reactions": {"url":
