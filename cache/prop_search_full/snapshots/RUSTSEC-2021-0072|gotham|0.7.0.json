The `AsyncTestRequestBuilder` implements `Into<hyper::Client>` though, so the option to use that directly is still there.\r\n\r\nAt least one open question I'm asking myself: Should the `AsyncTestClient` have a clone of the `Arc<AsyncTestServerInner>` so that the server is kept alive as long as there is still a remaining client?

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1456\">1456</a>)</li>\n<li>Added <code>TcpUserTimeout</code> socket option (sockopt) on Linux and Fuchsia.\n(#<a

bad UTF,\njust like <code>ptsname</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1446\">#1446</a>)</li>\n<li>Nix's error type is now a simple wrapper around the platform's Errno.  This\nmeans it is now <code>Into&lt;std::io::Error&gt;</code>.  It's also <code>Clone</code>, <code>Copy</code>, <code>Eq</code>, and\nhas a small fixed size.  It also requires less typing.  For example, the old\nenum variant <code>nix::Error::Sys(nix::errno::Errno::EINVAL)</code> is now simply\n<code>nix::Error::EINVAL</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1446\">#1446</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<h2>[0.21.0] - 31 May 2021</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>getresuid</code> and <code>getresgid</code>\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1430\">1430</a>)</li>\n<li>Added TIMESTAMPNS support for linux\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1402\">1402</a>)</li>\n<li>Added <code>sendfile64</code> (#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1439\">1439</a>)</li>\n<li>Added <code>MS_LAZYTIME</code> to <code>MsFlags</code>\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1437\">1437</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made <code>forkpty</code> unsafe, like <code>fork</code>\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1390\">1390</a>)</li>\n<li>Made <code>Uid</code>, <code>Gid</code> and <code>Pid</code> methods <code>from_raw</code> and <code>as_raw</code> a <code>const fn</code>\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1429\">1429</a>)</li>\n<li>Made <code>Uid::is_root</code> a <code>const fn</code>\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1429\">1429</a>)</li>\n<li><code>AioCb</code> is now always pinned.  Once a <code>libc::aiocb</code> gets sent to the kernel,\nits address in memory must not change.  Nix now enforces that by using\n<code>std::pin</code>.  Most users won't need to change anything, except when using\n<code>aio_suspend</code>.  See that method's documentation for the new usage.\n(#<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440\">1440</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
