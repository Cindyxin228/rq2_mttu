The other classes of `BrokerError::Input` are all integration issues, and can use the generic template.\r\n - I've added `BrokerError::ProviderInput`, which covers some of the previous cases for `BrokerError::Provider` and `BrokerError::Input`. This is specifically for errors related to the request input (thus 400), not provider communication (still 503). All `BrokerError::Input` is now related to the RP, while all `BrokerError::Provider*` is related to the provider. Error messages reflect this.\r\n - Internal errors and rate limiting now no longer redirect back to the RP, and always display a message.\r\n - Internal errors are now logged with a reference number, which is also visible on the error page. This number is also z-base-32, so it can also be read on the phone, for example.\r\n - Error pages are now translated.\r\n\r\n@onli Can you push a commit here with German translations for the new
