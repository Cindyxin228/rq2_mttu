PR makes the Sites app the default server for storing/serving UI artifacts, instead of requiring the same `storeSys` boilerplate to be used within every app.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, both the package infra and psibase CLI tool were updated to call `storeSys` on `sites`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I needed to add a Sites plugin to accommodate the Branding app, which was previously calling its own `storeSys` action manually.\r\n\r\nI removed the `storageInterface`, `WebContentRow`, and `serveContent` as interfaces, since they are no longer needed.\r\n\r\n# Docs changes\r\n\r\nI also updated StorageInterface docs, CLI docs, and package support docs.\r\n\r\n# Benefits\r\n\r\n* Simpler to write services: 99% of cases it is unnecessary to add the store/serveContent boilerplate to a service.\r\n* RPC services can now be used exclusively for servicing queries, which makes them read-only and easier to reason about\r\n* Makes upgrades to UI storage/service easier as it is now centralized. For example it should now be fairly trivial to add gzip compression on all artifacts that use the Sites app.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/867/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/867/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/861", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/861/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/861/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/861/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/861", "id": 2546431120, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG1ZJ4858kwJg", "number": 861, "title": "Union cargo package dependencies", "user": {"login": "James-Mart", "id": 42752296, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzUyMjk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42752296?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart", "html_url": "https://github.com/James-Mart", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5901829778, "node_id": "LA_kwDOG1ZJ488AAAABX8bGkg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/labels/Dev%20Experience", "name": "Dev Experience", "color": "fef2c0", "default": false, "description": "Related to the experience of developers"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-09-24T21:31:34Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T19:53:37Z", "closed_at": "2024-09-30T19:53:35Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/pulls/861", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/861", "diff_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/861.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/861.patch", "merged_at": "2024-09-30T19:53:35Z"}, "body": "This allows package dependencies to be specified in any crate in a cargo-package instead of only the service crate.\r\nDependencies put in multiple crates will be unioned for inclusion in the final package.\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the dependencies for the ChainMail package from the service crate to the root crate.

provide such functionality). If no user is logged in to an app, and a plugin schedules a transaction for execution, the current behavior will automatically log in \"alice\". This maintains the existing behavior that alice is the sender of all transactions by default, except this PR adds the ability to change the sender by calling `loginTemp` with a different account name.\r\n\r\nLogin is app-specific, meaning if an app calls `accounts:plugin/accounts->loginTemp(\"alice\")` to log alice in, she is only logged in on that particular app. \r\n\r\nThe final `login` function that will replace and obsolete `loginTemp` will spawn a new tab with an oauth-like login flow. But until that exists, we have this temporary function to allow apps to directly log users in.\r\n\r\n# ClientData plugin\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces the `ClientData` plugin, as mentioned in the plugin storage [specification](https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/issues/740).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/799/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Refactors the SPKI library that was previously coupled to AuthSig/RAuthSig, it is now its own library in the same namespace that can be independently linked\r\n2. Minor improvement to the tester, starting to remove its dependency on the `psibase::PublicKey` type (secp256k1 keys), which is being deprecated.\r\n3. Wraps `AuthSig` and `AuthK1` in their own namespaces, to better isolate functionality that is specific to each auth library.\r\n\r\nAnd there are a few additions also related to auth:\r\n1. Adds some functionality to the AuthSig plugin (The ability to set the key of the caller, and the ability to create and return a new keypair in pem format)\r\n2. Adds a new library (also in AuthSig namespace) for parsing PEM to PrivateKeyInfo. Basically the private key equivalent to the SPKI library, although there's no packing/unpacking logic because it's intended to be used for signing in tests, not as objects that can packed and sent to the node.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/735/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,
