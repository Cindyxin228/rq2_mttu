async task, while live audio threads are grouped up into full sync threads. Tasks are dynamically promoted and demoted based on whether they have any live audio tracks. This adds in some other niceties like preventing packet buffer reallocations, where possible. I intend to add reclamation of packet buffers, worker threads, and offloading expensive tasks to other threads.\r\n\r\nThis defaults to grouping 16 live calls per thread, mainly to prevent issues with users not compiling in release mode and/or using weaker machines. This can be configured during `Config` creation, and should be tuned for users at scale -- for instance, a passthrough-only workload can serve up to ~660 calls per thread on a Ryzen 5700X.\r\n\r\nTo put this in context, if all calls are live, this defaults to a 16x reduction in the amount of threads used. If only 30% of calls are live, the remainder all go in a single async task, giving an asymptotic 53x reduction of thread count.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Cleanup & document the draft implementation\r\n- [x] Fix Benchmarks to account for scheduler\r\n- [x] Integrate testing of scheduler behaviours into harness\r\n- [x] Periodically reclaim threads and packet blocks\r\n- [x] Update ARCHITECTURE.md",

processing (i.e., one day eliminating ffmpeg).\r\n\r\n- [x] Audiopus-based Symphonia codec and DCA1 framing.\r\n- [x] Ensure that Opus packet passthrough can be performed through Symphonia.\r\n- [x] Port mixing infrastructure (and packet passthrough).\r\n- [x] Rework `input` interface.\r\n- [x] Implement basic DASH handling for youtube and other multimedia handlers extracted from youtube-dl.\r\n- [ ] Investigate upstreaming MKV support to Symphonia.\r\n- [x] Port our stream-cacheing wrappers to this ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThere will be some slight issues stemming from the fact that we will now be parsing metadata from bytestreams as they arrive:\r\n* How will metadata be accessible to users before it enters the mixer? Is this just a `spawn_blocking` on the initial `Format` parse phase? Pass messages out from the main mixer context?\r\n* Users will need to be able to both pass in raw `MediaSourceStream`s, `Read`s, *and* fully processed `(Format, Metadata, ...)` sets -- due to the above, and as some extra metadata will *only* be exposed by youtube-dl, for instance.\r\n* Until MKV support is impl'd, we'll probably need to peek at bytes internally and pass over to ffmpeg on a decode failure. Having such a fallback should probably be toggleable.\r\n* We'll probably need to offer one or two wrappers to hand over `AsyncRead`s into the mixing system (as well as automating extension/MIME type extraction from `File`s or HTTP responses).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/serenity-rs/songbird/issues/89/reactions", "total_count": 10, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
