This disables a lot of work, but sets us up to carefully reintroduce later.\r\n\r\nThe biggest changes are that we have several core constructs:\r\n- `Server` is the main application struct (formerly called `App`).\r\n- `Endpoint` (trait) is the endpoint people work with.\r\n- `Request` is what is is passed to `Endpoint` and represents an incoming request. (formerly called `Context`).\r\n- `Response` is what is returned from `Endpoint` and represents an outgoing response.\r\n\r\nBoth `Request` and `Response` operate with `AsyncRead`, and have shorthand methods to send and receive json, forms, querystrings, etc.\r\n\r\nI believe this should dramatically streamline the experience of using Tide, and overall make writing HTTP services a lot nicer!\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n__echo server__\r\n```rust\r\nlet app = tide::new();\r\napp.at(\"/echo\").get(|req| async move { req });\r\napp.listen(\"localhost:8080\").await?;\r\n```\r\n__hello world__\r\n```rust\r\nlet app = tide::new();\r\napp.at(\"/echo\").get(|_| async move { \"hello world\" });\r\napp.listen(\"localhost:8080\").await?;\r\n```\r\n\r\n##
