The goal of this is to enable the lookup of JavaScript files by debug ID. As we are not using much of the `DebugSession` abstraction for this yet, i chose not to add this to the trait but just the particular implementation of a session for source bundles. Lookup requires knowledge of the file type and only returns contents, no meta information.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet sess = bundle.debug_session().unwrap();\r\nlet f = sess\r\n    .source_by_debug_id(\r\n        \"5e618b9f-54a9-4389-b196-519819dd7c47\".parse().unwrap(),\r\n        SourceFileType::MinifiedSource,\r\n    )\r\n    .unwrap()\r\n    .expect(\"should exist\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Manifest Format Changes\r\n\r\nThe manifest gains a new well known key in the `headers` dictionary called `debug-id` which so far is exclusively used to refer to debug IDs of source maps and minified source files. However it's intentionally kept generic in case there is further use of this in the future. For instance it might be valuable for discovering debug files for `.wasm` files on the internet via HTTP header.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"files\": {\r\n    \"foo.min.js\": {\r\n      \"type\":\"minified_sourec\",\r\n      \"url\": \"https://mycdn.invalid/foo/foo.min.js\",\r\n      \"headers\": {\r\n        \"sourcemap\": \"foo.min.map\",\r\n        \"debug-id\": \"eb6e60f1-65ff-4f6f-adff-f1bbeded627b\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"debug_id\": \"06f93af5-832b-3bbc-6dfd-27a46912605a\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally the use of `debug_id` in the toplevel manifest is now also used to refer to the artifact bundle for JavaScript. This means that in the JavaScript case we have multiple IDs at play:\r\n\r\n* toplevel `debug_id`: refers to the artifact bundle (source bundle) of a particular upload / release\r\n* per file `debug_id`: refers to the particular debug ID of an individual minified source and it's corresponding source map\r\n\r\nThis also changes the implementation to always lowercase headers before writing and after reading for simplified handling.\r\n\r\n# Source Maps vs Indexed RAM Bundles\r\n\r\nBecause we have different `SourceFileType`s for normal source maps and indexed RAM bundles they require separate handling for the caller. This is probably sensible as they are nothing alike but it's a bit odd.\r\n\r\n# Artifact vs Source Bundle\r\n\r\nThis commit also documents that a source bundle and an artifact bundle are really the same thing, with some minor differences about how we refer to it depending on if it's use to hold sources for a debug file, or if it holds release like artifacts for JavaScript processing.\r\n\r\n# Other API Changes\r\n\r\nThis also adds missing functionality to the `SourceBundleDebugSession` to make this actually useful for JavaScript processing:\r\n\r\n* `source_by_url` is added to look up a source by URL. Open question here is if this can just be the same as `source_by_path`? It's odd that we have two ways to key this really.\r\n* `source_by_debug_id` is the canonical way now to look up sources by debug ID + kind\r\n* `SourceFileDescriptor` is added to better describe what a source is for. The descriptor has all the API necessary to retrieve information from source files (contents and meta data) that is relevant for symbolication and unminification:\r\n  * `ty` returns the `SourceFileType`. This was previously impossible to read after setting.\r\n  * `contents` returns the contents if available, otherwise `url` should be used for fetching.\r\n  * `url` doubles as a way to either refer to a source link or the canonical URL of the source file. There is no reason why these need to be separate methods as they are referring to the same thing anyways.\r\n  * `path` is just the path that was used to look up the source for native source bundle companions\r\n  * `debug_id` returns the parsed `DebugId` for source maps and minified sources in bundles that have debug IDs\r\n  * `source_mapping_url` returns either the `sourcemap` or `x-sourcemap` reference in the manifest of the bundle. If neither can be found, it falls back to parsing the embedded contents. This makes it convenient enough to use though one could make an argument that the parsing logic should go elsewhere.", "reactions": {"url":
