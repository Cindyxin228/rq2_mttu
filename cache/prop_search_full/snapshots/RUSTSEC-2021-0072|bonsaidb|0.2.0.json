Passwords are exchanged using [`custodian-password`](https://github.com/khonsulabs/custodian/tree/main/password). This is a simplified wrapper around the leading `OPAQUE-PAKE` implementation. We will have simple, easy to understand documentation about this before long, but the summary is that the password for the users will be encrypted on the client before being sent to the server, and the server has no way of knowing the original password. Yet, it can be confident on a subsequent login that the password provided is the same with additional validations being able to be done on the client if state is able to be saved. tl;dr: what's better than storing salted+hashed passwords? Not storing anything valuable at all, yet still being able to verify a login securely!\r\n\r\nPart of making this work is also needing to be able store secrets securely, so the beginnings of a Vault is also being implemented in this pull request.\r\n\r\nTodos:\r\n- [x] Add opaque networking types\r\n- [x] Implement user management\r\n- [x] Determine how to handle encryption key permissions\r\n- [x] Fix docs that still reference server instead of storage.\r\n- [x] Implement document encryption/decryption\r\n- [x] Logged In event on backend\r\n- [x] Delete User\r\n- [x] Add test flows for being unable to retrieve a document due to missing permissions to the encryption key.\r\n- ~[ ] Backup support -- either decrypt or need to store the key id and export the keys.~ Split to #67.\r\n- [x] Document encryption\r\n- ~[ ] Key Value encryption~ Split to #66.\r\n- [x] Add `PublicKeyEncryption` enum that has the current algorithm set for HPKE. Add this to the HPKEPayload struct, allowing us to migrate to other algorithms in the future and be able to distinguish between them.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
