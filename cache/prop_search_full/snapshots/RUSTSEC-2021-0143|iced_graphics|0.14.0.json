"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/pull/3059.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-23T00:41:49Z"}, "body": "This PR implements the foundations of a first-class end-to-end testing toolkit compatible with any `iced` application.\r\n\r\n# The Test Recorder\r\nThe most important new tool of this update is the tester (or test recorder).\r\n\r\nThe tester can be enabled through the new `tester` feature flag. When enabled, your `iced` application will be decorated with an interface that allows you to both record and play tests as well as export and import them as files.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71624ba7-52f6-4432-a16e-6277ad91a100\r\n\r\nThe long term goal of this tool is to be a fully-featured testing suite for QA engineers to create tests that emulate user interactions as well as define assertions and expectations about a user interface.\r\n\r\n# The Emulator\r\nOnce end-to-end tests have been recorded and saved, we need a way to run them\u2014ideally in a completely headless environment.\r\n\r\nThe new `Emulator` type implements a headless runtime where test instructions can be executed.\r\n\r\nUnlike the existing `Simulator` type, an `Emulator` _does_ execute tasks and subscriptions and, therefore, side effects will be materialized. It's as close to running the real thing as possible!\r\n\r\nAn `Emulator` can be configured with different _modes_, which change the waiting strategy before proceeding to the next instruction.\r\n\r\nYou should rarely have to use this type directly. Instead, users are expected to leverage the new `iced_test::run` function to run an entire directory of tests for their applications:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() -> iced::Result {\r\n    application().run()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn application() -> Application<impl Program<Message = Message>> {\r\n    iced::application(State::new, State::update, State::view)\r\n        // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[cfg(test)]\r\nmod tests {\r\n    use super::application;\r\n\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn it_passes_the_e2e_tests() -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n        iced_test::run(\r\n            application(),\r\n            format!(\"{}/tests\", env!(\"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR\")),\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Program Presets\r\nIn order to be useful, end-to-end tests must be reproducible.\r\n\r\nThis can be a challenge, since executing them often produces side effects that change external state. When done naively, these side effects can affect next executions of the test; losing reproducibility in the process.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, an `iced` application can now define a list of _presets_. A `Preset` simply describes a certain way to create the initial state of an application.\r\n\r\nTests can then reference a particular preset, which can be leveraged to ensure an application is exactly in a reproducible state before the test is executed.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the `todos` example defines a couple of presets:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn presets() -> impl IntoIterator<Item = Preset<Todos, Message>> {\r\n    [\r\n        Preset::new(\"Empty\", || {\r\n            (Todos::Loaded(State::default()), Task::none())\r\n        }),\r\n        Preset::new(\"Carl Sagan\", || {\r\n            (\r\n                Todos::Loaded(State {\r\n                    input_value: \"Make an apple pie\".to_owned(),\r\n                    filter: Filter::All,\r\n                    tasks: vec![Task {\r\n                        id: Uuid::new_v4(),\r\n                        description: \"Create the universe\".to_owned(),\r\n                        completed: false,\r\n                        state: TaskState::Idle,\r\n                    }],\r\n                    dirty: false,\r\n                    saving: false,\r\n                }),\r\n                Task::none(),\r\n            )\r\n        }),\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Ice Test Syntax\r\nEnd-to-end tests that have been exported are saved as text files using a new custom syntax.\r\n\r\nThese test files are expected to have the `.ice` extension and, as a result, we call these tests \"ice tests\" or simply \"ice\". I think the name works well not only because the library is named `iced`, but also because end-to-end tests are meant to \"freeze\" the behavior of an application completely in time.\r\n\r\nThe details of the syntax are _very likely_ to change in the near future and, therefore, relying to much on this new feature is not encouraged yet! The changes here simply set up the first foundations for all of the testing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you are curious, here is what the current `carl_sagan.ice` test looks like for the `todos` example, which is already running as part of our CI pipeline:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nviewport: 500x800\r\nmode: Immediate\r\npreset: Empty\r\n-----\r\nclick \"What needs to be done?\"\r\ntype \"Create the universe\"\r\ntype enter\r\ntype \"Make an apple pie\"\r\ntype enter\r\nexpect \"2 tasks left\"\r\nclick \"Create the universe\"\r\nexpect \"1 task left\"\r\nclick \"Make an apple pie\"\r\nexpect \"0 tasks left\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is a bit of metadata at the beginning\u2014stating the environment of the test\u2014followed by the list of test instructions.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is meant to be easy to read and write. In the long run, I'd like for QA engineers to be able to write tests from scratch without necessarily using the recorder.\r\n\r\n# The `Selector` API\r\nIn order to implement these tools, I have formalized the old `Selector` API in `iced_test` and moved it into its own subcrate: `iced_selector`.\r\n\r\nThis new `Selector` API can be leveraged to easily traverse the widget tree and extract any data from it:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// A type that traverses the widget tree to \"select\" data and produce some output.\r\npub trait Selector {\r\n    /// The output type of the [`Selector`].\r\n    ///\r\n    /// For most selectors, this will normally be a [`Target`]. However, some\r\n    /// selectors may want to return a more limited type to encode the selection\r\n    /// guarantees in the type system.\r\n    ///\r\n    /// For instance, the implementations of [`String`] and [`str`] of [`Selector`]\r\n    /// return a [`target::Text`] instead of a generic [`Target`], since they are\r\n    /// guaranteed to only select text.\r\n    type Output;\r\n\r\n    /// Performs a selection of the given [`Candidate`], if applicable.\r\n    ///\r\n    /// This method traverses the widget tree in depth-first order.\r\n    fn select(&mut self, candidate: Candidate<'_>) -> Option<Self::Output>;\r\n\r\n    /// Returns a short description of the [`Selector`] for debugging purposes.\r\n    fn description(&self) -> String;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis trait is implemented for `String`, `&str`, `widget::Id`, and any `FnMut(Candidate<_>) -> Option<T>`.\r\n\r\nWhen the `selector` feature flag is enabled, the API can be leveraged through the `widget::selector` module:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn find_first_task_bounds() -> Task<Option<Rectangle>> {\r\n    selector::delineate(\"Create the universe\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that should be all! I don't expect these features to be quite useful right away. I am just planting the seeds for now.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/3059/reactions", "total_count": 29, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 18,

new tech that the folks from the [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) toolkit came up with called [`subsecond`](https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/index.html). It performs hotpatching of Rust binaries at runtime, similar to how some malware operates.\r\n\r\n# Controversy\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to use this new tech is through Dioxus' opinionated CLI tool and dev server protocol: [`dioxus-cli`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/packages/cli). However, I personally love `cargo` and do not want to give it up; which is why I ported most of their technology into a generic tool: [`cargo-hot`](https://github.com/hecrj/cargo-hot).\r\n\r\nThis did spur some controversy and discussion in [a Bevy issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19296#issuecomment-2925887736), as the authors of `subsecond` felt I was ripping out their code. I will reiterate here that I have no plans on hard-forking `subsecond` nor competing directly with it and, furthermore, [I will do my best to port any considerable improvements that land in `cargo-hot` back to `dioxus-cli`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/4244).\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nThe hot reloading client will be active when the `hot` feature flag is enabled. However, the build system needs to build and send patches to the executable; so a new build command is needed.\r\n\r\nLet's assume you define a `debug` feature in your `Cargo.toml` that enables the `hot` feature:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[features]\r\ndebug = [\"iced/hot\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, you must install `cargo-hot`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo install --locked --git https://github.com/hecrj/cargo-hot.git cargo-hot\r\n```\r\n\r\n`cargo-hot` is meant to be a drop-in replacement for `cargo run`, so if you were running your project with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run --features debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can simply replace `run` with `hot`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo hot --features debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! `iced` integrates internally with `subsecond`, so your code does not need to change at all.\r\n\r\nSimply edit your code and see it reload live!\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\n\r\n- Very experimental! May crash your OS.\r\n- Only changes to the root crate will trigger a reload.\r\n- Changes to your application `State` or `Message` types will need a cold restart (for now!).\r\n- Wasm is not supported at the moment.\r\n\r\nCloses #21.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/3000/reactions", "total_count": 61, "+1": 18, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

is a new companion debugging tool that can be summoned by pressing F12 when the `debug` feature is enabled\u2014replacing the old (and hideous) debug overlay.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afb74f5-65e6-4fac-9124-6c64bf496304\r\n\r\n[`comet`]: https://github.com/iced-rs/comet\r\n\r\nWhen the `debug` feature is enabled, an `iced` application will send performance metrics through a socket to any server implementing the `iced_beacon` protocol.\r\n\r\n[`comet`] is one of such servers. It is built with iced itself and you can find the code over here: https://github.com/iced-rs/comet\r\n\r\nOf course, this all means you could build your own custom debugger if you wanted to! It should all be reusable enough.\r\n\r\n# Custom Performance Metrics\r\n\r\nAs I introduced in #2891, you can decorate any piece of code with [`debug::time`](https://docs.iced.rs/iced/debug/fn.time.html) and [`debug::time_with`](https://docs.iced.rs/iced/debug/fn.time_with.html) to time and visualize different parts of your app.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d47b8b6-3ead-4561-a0f6-00faf5877c28\r\n\r\n# Time Traveling\r\n\r\nAs you know, iced uses the Elm Architecture. One of the advantages of this architecture is that application state can only be mutated in a single place: `update`\u2014and only in response of a `Message`. Furthermore, impure side effects are encouraged to happen inside `Task` and `Subscription` which are run indirectly by the runtime.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this means that if we have an initial state and a list of messages, then we should be able to replicate any state the application has been at _any_ point in time. In other words, we can __time travel__.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e49695c-0261-4b43-ac2e-8d7da5454c4b\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278953fe-d190-4a15-8847-520509a90482\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ccf67e5-68cc-43a9-950b-f317bf4d1a6b\r\n\r\nPretty cool, huh? Time traveling can be enabled with the new `time-travel` feature. Activating it will force a `Clone` bound on your `Message` type.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying but... the feature is very experimental! It will only work well if your `update` logic is _pure_; meaning it does not rely on external state (e.g. calling `Instant::now`).\r\n\r\nUse it carefully, it may eat your laundry!", "reactions":
