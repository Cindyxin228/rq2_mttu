updates the version of `lambda-http` to 0.7.1. The crate now depends on `aws-lambda-events` 0.7.2 or higher whereas it previously depended on that of ^0.7.\r\n\r\nThis crate currently does not compile against `aws-lambda-events` 0.7.0 or 0.7.1. In `aws-lambda-events` 0.7.0, the module `query_map` is private when it should be public for `lambda-http` to compile. Similarly, in `aws-lambda-events` 0.7.1, the trait bound `QueryMap: FromStr` is not satisfied so `lambda-http` does not compile either.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered as part of [this test failure](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/actions/runs/3330967146/jobs/5510160282) in CI for https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/pull/1907.
