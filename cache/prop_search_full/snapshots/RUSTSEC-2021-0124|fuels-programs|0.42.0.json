"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/pull/950.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-25T08:55:55Z"}, "body": "The main changes:\r\n- The signing of the transaction and predicate id generation requires `ChainId`(`ConsensusParameters`). \r\n- Now tokens should be transferred to the contract first, and after you can transfer them via `SMO` or another transfer. So in some tests first we need to transfer money to the contract first.\r\n- Replaced all unsafe code from `fuel-crypto` with safe analog.\r\n- The `produce_blocks` function is updated and doesn't require `TimeParameters`.\r\n- On the `fuel-tx`/`fuel-core` side now, there is a difference in whether the message contains data. If data is empty, it is `MessageCoin` that acts like a `Coin`(has the same rules during execution). If the data field is not empty, then it is a retryable message(or `MessageData`). Messages like this can't be used to pay a transaction fee, and if the execution fails, the message is not consumed(you can use it again in the next transactions). More about them you can read in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/946. Also, the API changed for resources and not it is `Coins` again. Because of that, some tests now require messages with empty data to be able to spend them.\r\n- Removed redundant usage of `MessageId`. Now the identifier of the message is a `Nonce`.\r\n- Removed `Output::Message`. Now you don't need to specify it in the outputs. Because of that `SMO` opcode doesn't require a message output index anymore. \r\n- The proof API is updated with a new design: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1046. If you want to prove the block at height `X` you need at least a committed `X + 1` block.\r\n\r\nBecause some of opcodes were updated the examples require a new `sway`. The corresponding PR: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pull/4525. It creates a cycle of dependencies with this PR.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/829 https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/933\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGES: \r\n- `Predicate::set_provider` now returns a `Result` because it can fail if the \"new\" provider has different consensus parameters than the consensus parameters used previously\r\n- `Predicate` can be loaded with a provider by using `load_from_with_provider` and `from_code_and_provider`. The `from_code` and `load_from` remain, and use default `ConsensusParameters` value. This can be discussed further.\r\n- `Provider::new` now takes a `ConsensusParameters` argument, so we can avoid changing the API of downstream clients. \r\n- `setup_test_client` now returns `ConsensusParameters` of the client. This was either this or `setup_test_provider` would have to change, and the former is much less used than the latter.", "reactions": {"url":

issue for context. Only implementation notes to follow.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* `Abigen` code will now refer to types through the `fuels` package since it is now wasm compatible. @deekerno @ra0x3 the indexer should now just include `fuels` as a dependency taking care to disable the default features (since `std` is the default). You can access `fuels_core` stuff through `fuels::core`; `fuels_types` through `fuels::types`; `fuels_macros` through `fuels::macros`. \r\n\r\nThe hotfix is still in place -- mostly to make the Abigen code-writing experience more enjoyable. If we remove it completely then we'd have to do a `no_std` check whenever we use a Vec, `format!`, `String` etc. \r\n\r\nThis way we always write `::std::vec::Vec` and leave the rest to the (now smaller) wasm hotfix.\r\n\r\nAs we become more wasm compatible the rest of the `fuels-*` crates will become exposed through `fuels` reexports.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any

#854\r\n\r\nA big thank you to @hal3e for help with the CI. \r\n\r\nThe wasm offending functionality is now hidden behind the feature `std` in `fuels-types` and in `fuels-core` as well. \r\n\r\n### Breakage:\r\n@digorithm \r\nIt is part of the crate's default features, so most users shouldn't feel the change -- especially since there weren't other other features that would have made somebody do `default-features = false` in their `Cargo.toml`. \r\n\r\nBut if they did for whatever reason, then they might see parts of `fuels-types` disappear since the `std` feature would not be enabled. So that makes it a theoretically breaking change.\r\n\r\nAlso `fuels` had two feature flags: `fuel-core` and `fuel-core-lib`. `fuel-core` is removed since it was implicitly added because the optional dependency `fuel-core` had not been referred to by prepending `dep:` to it.\r\n\r\n`fuel-core` used to enable the fuel-core-lib only partially and was not the right flag to use.\r\n\r\n### About the implementation\r\nCargo features should be additive by design. This means that you cannot remove dependencies by adding features. \r\n\r\nThis further means that wasm support is generally implemented by *hiding* wasm-offending code behind a feature (such as `std`). \r\n\r\nIn our case, if we want to be WASM compatible, we must not enable the `std` feature on any `fuels-*` crates our project might depend on.\r\n\r\nFeature unification makes this a bit difficult. If there is even one dependency that enabled `std` on some `fuels-*` crate, all other crates that are part of that compilation will also have the `std` feature enabled for that crate.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I've made it default for our workspace dependencies to start off without defaults (and thus without the `std` flag). \r\n\r\nIf any of our crates need it, they will have to enable the feature explicitly.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/839/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,

@Br1ght0ne for his help around wasm. Please check if this makes sense :D \r\n\r\nTo be considered a hotfix in order to unblock the indexer team. I will restructure/clean it asap. \r\n\r\nEven though you can use parts of the rust stdlib in wasm, I've still decided to add `#![no_std]` to the wasm test. This at least catches any usage of `std::` in the expanded code. If we ever find ourselves using subsets of the std that are compatible with wasm but not available in `core` or `alloc` then we'll figure out how to write a better test.\r\n\r\nThe `fuels` dependency has been removed from the wasm test, so the passing of the test proves we're not referencing `fuels` anymore. \r\n\r\nThe derive macros of `Tokenizable`, `Parameterize` and `TryInto` had to receive two new attributes: `FuelsCorePath` and `NoStd`. \r\n\r\nThe first one is so that we don't use `fuels` when expanding the derive macro in wasm builds.\r\n\r\nThe second one communicates that the derive macro should generate wasm-compatible code. It might also be done using conditional compilation but then we would need to agree on the condition, i.e. do we add a feature flag `wasm`, do we use the built-in one `no_std`, etc. \r\n\r\nFrom now on, to ease the pain later, we should first see if something is available in `core` before referencing it from std when modifying Abigen.

enable predicates to be used as wallets, allowing payments and transactions to be made with them. The first step taken in this direction was to modify the `predicate_bindings` function so that it returns the `Predicate` data type, which will be further used as we use the wallet.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nMyPredicateHandler::load_from(\r\n\"../../packages/fuels/tests/predicates/predicate_signatures/out/debug/predicate_signatures.bin\",\r\n).set_data(signatures).get_predicate();\r\n```\r\nThis code loads the predicate .bin together with the signature for unlocking the predicate and returns the `Predicate` data type, which can be used as a wallet for making transactions, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I added a new public trait called `Account`, which includes a group of functions common to both wallets and predicates. Any function that receives `T: Account` as a parameter can use these common functions.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Account: std::fmt::Debug + Send + Sync { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPredicates that have dynamic data as input require special handling because the underlying pointer needs to be adjusted with the right offset for the actual data. To resolve the pointers of a given predicate input, we need to know all the previous tx inputs. The problem here is that the transaction can be modified at any point which can potentially invalidate the offsets.\r\n\r\n`fuels_types::Input` is introduced to circumvent this. For predicates, it stores the relevant resource and the predicate data as `UnresolvedBytes`.\r\n\r\nSome of `ScriptTransaction`s methods have been moved to the new `ScriptTransactionBuilder`. The idea is that the builder works on our input types and still allows for modifications. Once `build()` is called, the predicate data is resolved for all predicate inputs and the resulting `ScriptTransaction` doesn't allow for further changes to the inputs.\r\n\r\nSome caveats:\r\n- We currently don't have a native `Output` type. Should we implement as a thin wrapper for the sake of consistency?\r\n- `UnresolvedBytes` has been moved to fuels_types to avoid cyclic deps. This also means that `Data` moved with it. Since \r\n   `Data` is used for parts of the abigen, we had to make it public. Is there a better alternative?\r\n- To deduplicate significant amounts of code, `get_asset_inputs_for_amount` accepts `witness_index` as a parameter. For predicates we just ignore it in the implementation but overall it doesn't make sense in the context of predicates.\r\n \r\ncloses #809", "reactions": {"url":

#807\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `ScriptTransaction` and `CreateTransaction`  which act as a wrappers for the script and create tx type.

setters to provide a better devx when creating custom scripts or reading the underlying tx from a contract call.\r\n\r\nBuilding a tx:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut tx = ScriptTransaction::new(&inputs, &outputs, params)\r\n                .with_script(binary)\r\n                .with_script_data(data);\r\n                \r\n// or to extend

doesn't provide any functionality at this point.\r\n- constants and params were moved from fuels-core to fuels-types to avoid circular dep\r\n- moved tx validity check to

`fuels_types::Error` are not needed anymore. In this PR I have tried to remove the unnecessary error variants and I have introducing an `error!` macro (thanks @segfault-magnet for the macro implementation)\r\n\r\nMore specifically, I have:\r\n- removed `anyhow` completely from the SDK.\r\n  - We had a `From` implementation that turned any `anyhow` error to `ParseTokenStreamError` which was wrong.\r\n- removed the `CodecError`\r\n- removed Error variants:\r\n  - `ParseIntError`\r\n  - `ParseBoolError`\r\n  - `ParseHexError`\r\n  - `ParseTokenStreamError`\r\n  - `CompilationError`\r\n- added `Result` type alias `Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Error>` \r\n\r\nAdded the `error!` macro. This macro makes it easier to write the error manually. Prevously we had to do something like this:\r\n```rust\r\nErr(Error::InstantiationError(format!(\r\n       \"Expected `bool`, got {:?}\",\r\n       other\r\n))),\r\n```\r\nnow we can write:\r\n```rust\r\nErr(error!(InstantiationError,\r\n       \"Expected `bool`, got {:?}\",\r\n       other\r\n)),\r\n```\r\nIn addition, we can pass a string literal to the macro i.e. we do not have to use `.into()` or `to_string()` to turn it into a `String`.\r\nThis macro can only be used with errors that have a `String` field. Those are the errors that we manually make.\r\nIMO the macro makes the error instantiation cleaner. If the team does not like it we can remove it :smile:\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/796/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

file `packages/fuels/Forc.toml` that defines a `[workspace]` containing the paths to all integration tests.\r\n- All new tests should be added to this file.\r\n- The `test-projects` script has been deleted as it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n### Question\r\nShould a script be created to automate the process of adding tests to `Forc.toml`?\r\n\r\n### How to Build Tests\r\nTo build the integration tests, go to the `packages/fuels` folder and run the `force build` command, or `forc build --path packages/fuels`. Other commands offered by `forc` can also be used in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses #768", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/792/reactions", "total_count":

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/785\r\n\r\nThe new `derive` macros will be implemented in the `fuels-macros` package, formerly `fuels-abigen-macro`.\r\n\r\nTo use the  `derive` macros in `fuels-types` we need to import `fuels-macros` there. However, this will create a dependency cycle:\r\n\r\n`fuels-types` <- `fuels-core` <- `fuels-macros` <- `fuels-types` ...\r\n\r\n@segfault-magnet and I agreed that the natural place to break the cycle is `fuels-core` <- `fuels-macros`. This dependency is mainly due to the `Abigen` code being in `fuels-core`. We do not see a need to have the code generation in `fuels-core` so we have moved it to the `fuels-macros`, where we have the rest of the code generation.\r\n\r\nBreaking change:\r\n- `Abigen` is not public anymore - if there should come a time when `Abigen` needs to be public we can discuss alternatives like creating a new crate.\r\n\r\n<s>P.S. GitHub bugged out on the line numbers... we did not delete 1500 lines :smile: </s>\r\nThe deleted lines come from `functions_gen.rs` which should have been deleted by the big PR but made it through. It wasn't part of the compilation, just hanging there.\r\n\r\nAlso, the tokenizer is now dead, since it was only used by the cli tool, and we still haven't decided on what to do with it.",
