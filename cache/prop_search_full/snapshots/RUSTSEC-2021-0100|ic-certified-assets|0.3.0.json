with diminished voting power because of periodic confirmation, while 0.5.1 has the replica rev where ic_nns_init is fixed.\r\n\r\n## Changes in `cycles-ledger.bash`\r\n\r\nThis [PR](https://github.com/dfinity/dfx-extensions/pull/136) in the NNS extension makes the extension stop sending the \"set conversion rate\" to 1234567. This step was needed so that the conversion rate would be initialized when it would be otherwise not initialized (and therefore no way to mint cycles). Now with cycles ledger, the conversion rate is initialized to 1000000 [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/ce63b3d75fbd5912404468499ba85dd0e794acad/rs/nns/cmc/src/lib.rs#L27). Therefore the conversion rate proposal is no longer needed and therefore removed in the NNS extension. The minted cycles in `cycles-ledger.bash` are all adjusted to the default rate.\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n`ledger.bash` and `cycles-ledger.bash` should be fixed\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [ ] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/4187/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
