Supersedes https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1863.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAt the moment one can neither get confirmation when a response has been sent on the underlying transport, nor is one aware of response omissions. The latter was originally intended as a feature for support of one-way protocols, which seems like a bad idea in hindsight. The lack of a notification for sent responses may prohibit implementation of some request-response protocols that need to ensure a happens-before relation between sending a response and a subsequent request, besides possible uses for collecting statistics.\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n  * Dropped support for \"one-way\" request-response protocols.\r\n  * New `InboundFailure::ResponseOmission` variant.\r\n  * Removed `InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed` variant.\r\n  * `RequestResponse::send_response()` now returns a `Result`, allowing early detection of failed inbound requests due to timeout or a closed connection.\r\n  * New `RequestResponseEvent::ResponseSent` variant, emitted when the response has been successfully written on the underlying transport connection.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nEven with these changes, there is no _active_ notification for failed inbound requests as a result of connections unexpectedly closing, as is the case for outbound requests. Instead, for pending inbound requests this scenario can be identified, if necessary, either through errors returned on `send_response` or by the absence of both `InboundFailure` and `ResponseSent` events for a particular previously received request. Interest in this situation is not expected to be common and would otherwise require explicitly tracking all inbound requests in the `RequestResponse` behaviour just to actively report `ConnectionClosed` for each pending inbound request in that scenario, which would be a pity. Notably `RequestResponse::send_response` now also synchronously returns an error if the inbound upgrade handling the request has been aborted, due to timeout or closing of the connection, giving more options for graceful error handling for inbound requests. It is also noteworthy that client code that does not call `send_response()` will now necessarily receive a `InboundFailure::ResponseOmission`, so except for the case where a connection closes just after `send_response()` succeeded, client code is usually bound to notice a closed connection already on `send_response()`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This PR does not prohibit (re-)adding `InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed` and dedicated inbound request tracking in the future, and neither would doing so make any changes proposed here obsolete. The above discussion is just to expand on why I think the need for doing so becomes even less likely.\r\n\r\n## Throttled Wrapper Credit Grants\r\n\r\nAs an aside, the `Throttled` wrapper now no longer emits inbound or outbound error events occurring in the context of sending credit requests or responses. This is in addition to not emitting `ResponseSent` events for ACK responses of credit grants. I think the credit requests and responses, including errors, should be completely opaque to the user. If credit messages keep failing, the effect on the public API should merely be that of back-pressure due to running out of credit.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1867/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1867/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1862", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1862/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1862/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1862/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1862", "id": 751629214, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI4MTA3NjEy", "number": 1862, "title": "swarm: Add ExpandedSwarm::is_connected", "user": {"login": "mxinden", "id": 7047859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc4NTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden", "html_url": "https://github.com/mxinden", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-11-26T14:21:51Z", "updated_at": "2020-11-26T20:12:39Z", "closed_at": "2020-11-26T20:01:39Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1862", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1862", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1862.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1862.patch", "merged_at": "2020-11-26T20:01:39Z"}, "body": "Commit 335e55e6 removed the `ConnectionInfo` trait in favor of `PeerId`s.

This problem manifests itself in potential stalls / timeouts during protocol negotiation, because a peer does not necessarily wait for confirmation of a protocol before it sends the proposal for the next protocol upgrade. E.g. `/multistream/1.0.0 \\n /mplex/6.7.0` for the mplex upgrade may already be received and buffered by the `Framed` of the plaintext handshake by a peer before the handshake is complete. That peer will read the final handshake frame but then discard the remaining read buffer of `Framed`, leaving the remote waiting for the protocol confirmation for the next upgrade, but that proposal got \"lost\". The problem first appeared in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1765 where it was missed during review.\r\n\r\nThis surfaced, without looking for it, during some benchmark attempts with the TCP transport and plaintext protocol in order to settle https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/802. However, because the symptoms are the same, I'm reasonably certain that this is the actual cause of the early connection negotiation stalls observed in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1629#issuecomment-701396435, unrelated to the random upgrade timeouts (which should already be fixed), since that test setup intentionally uses the plaintext protocol.

This has permitted two improvements:\r\n     1. Message size verification during publishing (report to the user if the message is too large before attempting to send).\r\n     2. Message fragmentation. If an RPC is too large it is fragmented into its sub components and sent in smaller chunks. \r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThe peer eXchange protocol defined in the v1.1 spec is inactive in its current form. The current implementation permits sending `PeerId` in `PRUNE` messages, however a `PeerId` is not sufficient to form a new connection to a peer. A `Signed Address Record` is required to safely transmit peer identity information. Once these are confirmed (https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/217) a future PR will implement these and make PX usable. \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Final Note\r\n\r\nThis is currently undergoing further testing and an audit and I may modify this slightly as bugs come up :)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1720/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 5, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1720/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1884", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1884/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1884/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1884/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1884", "id": 760948832, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTM1NjkxNjkx", "number": 1884, "title": "Update async-tls requirement from 0.10.2 to 0.11.0", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2340311223, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQwMzExMjIz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "0366d6", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update a dependency file"}, {"id": 2527056927, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI3MDU2OTI3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/rust", "name": "rust", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update Rust code"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-12-10T06:23:48Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-10T08:23:07Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-10T08:16:09Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1884", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1884", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1884.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1884.patch", "merged_at": "2020-12-10T08:16:09Z"}, "body": "Updates the requirements on [async-tls](https://github.com/async-std/async-tls) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/async-rs/async-tls/commit/a8ca3ca5691e7c50f9aae34ccc5fefa331e06f3f\"><code>a8ca3ca</code></a> Release and tag 0.11.0</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/async-std/async-tls/compare/v0.10.2...v0.11.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
