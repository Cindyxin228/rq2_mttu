"Motivation\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe NIST curves are much more widely supported than secp256k1. Adding them will give us better compatibility with third party software and hardware.\r\n\r\nData formats\r\n===\r\n- The signature is encoded in compact form (64 bytes, r+s, big endian)\r\n- The public key is encoded as an X.509 Subject Public Key Info\r\n- The private key is encoded using `PKCS #8`\r\n\r\nVerify Service\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe VerifySys service (`verify-sys`) uses Botan.  Botan supports picking out only the required components much better than openssl does and compiles to WASM with only minimal tweaks. The main patch I needed to make was to add a stub exception library that simply aborts when an exception is thrown. VerifySys supports both named curves and arbitrary curves with explicit domain parameters. However, only 256-bit curves are useful right now, because SHA256 is applied by native.\r\n\r\nBlock Signing\r\n===\r\nNative block signing is supported using OpenSSL. Any private key supported by OpenSSL can be used to sign, however key generation is not configurable and always generates an r1 key. As with VerifySys, the use of SHA256 is hard-coded.\r\n\r\npsibase command line support\r\n===\r\nAll key command line arguments can be either base58 encoded keys as before or the name of a file containing a PEM or DER encoded key. A base58 key uses verifyec-sys/auth-ec-sys. ASN.1 encodings use verify-sys/auth-sys. Only k1 keys are supported right now. The public key must be in compressed form and must use the named curve representation of the parameters.\r\n\r\njs frontend support\r\n===\r\nKeys can be either PEM or Base58 encoded. When creating an account, account-sys always uses auth-sys. When signing or importing keys, the auth service will be deduced by querying the chain.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/491/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/491/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/489", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/489/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/489/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/489/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/489", "id": 1897225160, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG1ZJ485aYLmD", "number": 489, "title": "Add boot capability to admin-sys", "user": {"login": "James-Mart", "id": 42752296, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzUyMjk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42752296?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart", "html_url": "https://github.com/James-Mart", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5901847208, "node_id": "LA_kwDOG1ZJ488AAAABX8cKqA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/labels/Node%20infra", "name": "Node infra", "color": "683759", "default": false, "description": "Related to the necessary infrastructure provided by all psibase infrastructure providers"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2023-09-14T20:05:18Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T19:41:46Z", "closed_at": "2023-10-09T14:36:26Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/pulls/489", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/489", "diff_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/489.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/489.patch", "merged_at": "2023-10-09T14:36:26Z"}, "body": "This PR addresses the following requirements\r\n\r\n## Add a boot button to admin-sys\r\n\r\nAdd a simple boot button to admin-sys.
