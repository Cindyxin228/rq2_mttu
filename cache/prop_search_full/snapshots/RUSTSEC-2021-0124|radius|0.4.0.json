There's no functional change to the output of the library.\r\n\r\nI've added this as a cargo feature so that the MD5 crate is still used by default so as not to impact existing users who don't want the OpenSSL dependency. Using one feature doesn't compile in the dependencies of the other.\r\n\r\nI've also added extra workflow steps to test the two feature options explicitly and confirmed these pass.\r\n\r\nLet me know
