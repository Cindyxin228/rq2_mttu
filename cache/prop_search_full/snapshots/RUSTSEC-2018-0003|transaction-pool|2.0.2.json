this PR is to remove dependency to accounts\\ethkey for parity components, that use crypto utils from it. That would allow further decomposition of parity repo. Including move of secret store  into the separate repo.\r\nAdditional comments:\r\n1. I straightforwardly merged code from ethkey into parity crypto, that is responsible for work with key pairs, encryption etc.\r\n\r\n- I left wallets code (brain, brain prefix etc) in ethkey. Also left password.rs there\r\n- I didn't do any renaming and reorganization of parity crypto crate. May be it's worth doing, but I don't have good ideas and would be grateful for any suggestions.\r\n\r\n2. I'm not going to consider substrate code, related to the same crypto primitives.

a bit awkward (ptr lifetime), there is certainly a way to make it better.\r\n- memorydb construction through utility function (I put it in journaldb but it is probably not the best place).\r\n-
