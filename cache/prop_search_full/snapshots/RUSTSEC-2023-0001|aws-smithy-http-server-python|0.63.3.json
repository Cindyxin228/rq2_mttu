Currently that only includes supplying custom root certificates. This PR also refactors the way caching works. Previously we cached complete connectors with default resolver when the connector settings were known to be defaulted. The reason given in code and past commits for this caching resolves around the fact that `hyper-rustls` `with_native_roots()` configuration option re-loads platform root certificates on each invocation. Rather than cache the connector, instead I've switched the caching to only cache loading the certificates. This reduces a bit of complexity and required context to understand when we can cache. \r\n\r\n### Questions/Discussion\r\n\r\n1. There are a number of places we call `unwrap`/`expect` in this code. It was this way previously but I've introduced a few more. This stems from building a connector not returning a result. I don't know that I love this but I also suppose I can understand why we chose this. Now is the time to consider whether we'd approach it differently or not though or we are simply saying a valid HTTPS configuration.\r\n2. Loading native certs is all blocking file calls though and not async friendly. I haven't changed anything here but it caught my eye. It would be nice if this were more async friendly. The mitigation we chose to this seemed to be caching the connector and paying that cost once up front at construction time if possible.\r\n3. Both rustls and s2n take in PEM encoded certs. Rustls (via `rustls-pki-types`) provides a way to actually parse and load the certs as an independent configuration object (trust store). The issue is it converts them to DER format which makes using this for s2n not possible. It would be nice if we could load and validate certs before passing them off to rustls/s2n in a uniform way.\r\n4. Should `TlsContext` and/or `TrustStore` provider builders? Currently they just self mutate which is a pattern we use in some places (e.g. stalled stream protection config comes to mind). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nNew unit tests + existing TLS

Context\r\nContinuation of #4004, this PR is part 2 of the series. The PR focus on the request side, specifically handling the serialization of an initial request message for event stream operations using RPC-bound protocols.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nUnlike `initial-response`, handling `initial-request` for event stream operations does _not_ require calling an async function, allowing serialization to be completed within a synchronous context.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an updated snippet from the input serializer, rendered from a newly added codegen test (since we currently don\u2019t have AWS services with RPC protocols where the operation input contains event streams, this test represents such a service):\r\n```\r\n        let body = ::aws_smithy_types::body::SdkBody::from({\r\n            let error_marshaller =

This makes event stream operations like [SubscribeToShard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_SubscribeToShard.html) in Kinesis and [StartLiveTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartLiveTail.html) in CloudWatchLogs available in the Rust SDK, both of which are currently unavailable ([RemoveEventStreamOperations.kt](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/4004/files#diff-b94081365137754f8674df177705a472ede6d3c21da608fff68a450fec5abd26) removes them via model transformation as unsupported).\r\n\r\nNote that this PR is the first in a series and merged into a feature branch, not into the main branch. It intentionally does not address `TODO(EventStream)` or does not disable stalled stream protection for newly enabled event stream operations. It just focuses on implementing handling `initial-response` messages. The next PR will most likely focus on handling `initial-request` message, and the last PR will focus on code cleanup (hence if code review feedback is about code cleanup, I happily accept it but might defer it to the last PR).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAt its core, handling initial-response for event stream operations is boiled down to using [try_recv_initial](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/blob/ec4292005728cec42ca2f9f8ba40f6b5bb563b05/rust-runtime/aws-smithy-http/src/event_stream/receiver.rs#L208-L232) during deserialization phase within the orchestrator. Here is the issue, though. `try_recv_initial` is an async method but functions/methods in the deserializer in client SDKs are all synchronous, causing an impedance mismatch between async and sync. This means we need to find an async context somewhere in which to be able to call the `try_recv_initial` method.\r\n\r\nTo sidestep this design limitation, we customize the `send` method for event stream operations with RPC-bound protocols whose operation output contains an event stream member. The customization makes the epilogue of the `send` method look like the following (using `unwrap` for simplicity):\r\n```\r\n    pub async fn send(\r\n        self,\r\n    ) -> Result<crate::operation::some_op::SomeOp, SdkError<...>> {\r\n        let input = ...;\r\n        let runtime_plugins = ...;\r\n\r\n        // new epilogue of the send method\r\n        let output = crate::operation::some_op::SomeOp::orchestrate(&runtime_plugins, input).await?;\r\n\r\n        let message = output.response_stream.try_recv_initial().await.map_err(response_error).unwrap();\r\n\r\n        match message {\r\n            Some(message) => {\r\n                // If operation output contains non-event stream members, we will populate them here\r\n                let mut builder = output.into_builder(); // codegen needs to render this new `pub(crate)` conversion method on the output struct\r\n                builder = crate::protocol_serde::shape_some_op::de_some_op(message.payload(), output).unwrap();\r\n                Ok(builder.build().unwrap())\r\n            },\r\n            // In this `None` branch, `try_recv_initial` will set aside the initial frame it has read from event stream if it's not initial-response.\r\n            // The next time the user calls `recv` on the `EventReceiver`, the user correctly receives the frame that was read off.\r\n            None => Ok(output),\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis provides us with an async context where we can call `try_recv_initial` on an event stream member of an operation output struct and populate the non-event stream members of that struct. The downside though is that the operation output struct will be half-baked until the end of `send`, with non-event stream members uninitialized, so interceptors after deserialization won't have access to complete the output struct. (it's todo to document somewhere for operations in question).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes are for testing. Specifically\r\n- added `cloudwatchlogs` as a new service integration test (to test `start_live_trail` event stream operation)\r\n  - as part of this, the local helpers in `aws/sdk/integration-tests/transcribestreaming/tests/test.rs` have been moved to `aws_smithy_eventstream` and gated behind the `test-util` cargo feature.\r\n- added client SDK codegen test for event stream to verify the functionality in the cases a) an `initial-request` message is present and b) it is not\r\n  - [The event stream test model](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/blob/ec4292005728cec42ca2f9f8ba40f6b5bb563b05/codegen-core/src/main/kotlin/software/amazon/smithy/rust/codegen/core/testutil/EventStreamTestModels.kt#L20) has been modified for the client SDK to include non-event stream member in the operation output struct\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Existing CI\r\n- Added a service integration test for `cloudwatchlogs`\r\n- Added client SDK codegen tests for verifying initial-response message handling\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice._\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/4004/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/4004/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/4003", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/4003/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/4003/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/4003/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/4003", "id": 2839194504, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj86KeX3N", "number": 4003, "title": "Add `aws-smithy-observability` and `aws-smithy-observability-otel` crates", "user": {"login": "landonxjames", "id": 6853441, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTM0NDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853441?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames", "html_url": "https://github.com/landonxjames", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/landonxjames/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2025-02-07T22:18:24Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T21:21:24Z", "closed_at": "2025-02-14T21:21:23Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/4003", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/4003", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/4003.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/4003.patch", "merged_at": "2025-02-14T21:21:23Z"}, "body": "## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

"merged_at": "2025-01-22T22:25:44Z"}, "body": "## Motivation and Context\r\nThe smithy-rs minimal-versions test currently checks all transitive dependencies, which makes it difficult to satisfy the test requirements given that the minimum dependency versions specified in transitive dependencies can't be controlled. This PR updates this test to only check for direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe smithy-rs CI [runs the cargo minimal-versions test](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/blob/e41f7d7dfa84b38b1524823bdcac56f0dcc9dddc/tools/ci-scripts/check-rust-runtimes#L39) in the rust-runtime and aws/rust-runtime workspaces to make sure that the rust-runtime crates can still build even when the lowest possible version of each dependency is used. However, the minimal-versions test is not recommended by Rust:\r\n\r\n> https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#minimal-versions\r\nNote: It is not recommended to use this feature. Because it enforces minimal versions for all transitive dependencies, its usefulness is limited since not all external dependencies declare proper lower version bounds. It is intended that it will be changed in the future to only enforce minimal versions for direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n`direct-minimal-versions` can be used instead, which tests the minimum versions of only direct dependencies. This PR updates this test to use the `direct` variant of minimal-versions.\r\n\r\n### Dependency minimum version changes\r\nFor some reason, the direct minimal-versions check seems to be more strict about direct minimum versions than the transitive variant. Switching to the direct variant caused many cargo update issues like the following:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Cargo update failure example</summary>\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n\u276f cargo minimal-versions check --direct\r\ninfo: running `cargo update -Z direct-minimal-versions`\r\n    Updating crates.io index\r\nerror: failed to select a version for `tokio-stream`.\r\n    ... required by package `lambda_runtime v0.8.0`\r\n    ... which satisfies dependency `lambda_runtime = \"^0.8\"` of package `lambda_http v0.8.0`\r\n    ... which satisfies dependency `lambda_http = \"^0.8.0\"` of package `aws-smithy-http-server-python v0.63.2 (/Users/vclarksa/w/smithy-rs-fork/rust-runtime/aws-smithy-http-server-python)`\r\nversions that meet the requirements `^0.1.2` are: 0.1.17, 0.1.16, 0.1.15, 0.1.14, 0.1.12, 0.1.11, 0.1.10, 0.1.9, 0.1.8, 0.1.7, 0.1.6, 0.1.5, 0.1.4, 0.1.3, 0.1.2\r\n\r\nall possible versions conflict with previously selected packages.\r\n\r\n  previously selected package `tokio-stream v0.1.0`\r\n    ... which satisfies dependency `tokio-stream = \"^0.1\"` of package `aws-smithy-http-server-python v0.63.2 (/Users/vclarksa/w/smithy-rs-fork/rust-runtime/aws-smithy-http-server-python)`\r\n\r\nfailed to select a version for `tokio-stream` which could resolve this conflict\r\nerror: process didn't exit successfully: `/Users/vclarksa/.rustup/toolchains/1.81.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin/cargo update -Z direct-minimal-versions` (exit status: 101)\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIt seems that direct-minimal-versions requires that all direct dependencies within an environment be specified with the same minimum version. Additionally, if there is a direct dependency that is also specified by a transitive dependency, the direct dependency must specify a minimum version at least as high as the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nI resolved all such cargo update failures by choosing the highest minimum version specified somewhere in the environment, and applying this version everywhere the dependency is specified.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nThe modified `check-rust-runtimes` test should succeed.\r\n\r\nSome of the CI jobs are still failing. However, they appear to be unrelated to this change. These jobs also failed in the last hyper1 commit:\r\n- [Verify TLS configuration](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/actions/runs/12915992501/job/36020683438?pr=3980) failed for the [previous

manually](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/actions/runs/12915992496/job/36020737577?pr=3980) if necessary for this change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- If a checkbox below is not applicable,

We settled on `default-https-client`. This new flag when enabled and the appropriate min BMV is set will result in the new HTTPS stack being the default for clients.

The buckets are partitioned off the retry partition (which defaults to the service name and is already set by the default plugin). We use a `static` variable in the runtime for this which means that token buckets can and will apply to every single client that uses the same retry partition. The implementation tries to avoid contention on this new global lock by only consulting it if the retry partition is overridden after client creation. \r\n\r\nFor AWS SDK clients I've updated the default retry partition clients are created with to include the region when set. Now the default partition for a client will be `{service}-{region}` (e.g. `sts-us-west-2`) rather than just the service name (e.g. `sts`). This partitioning is a little more granular and closer to what we want/expect as failures in one region should not cause throttling to another (and vice versa for success in one should not increase available quota in another). \r\n\r\nI also updated the implementation to follow the SEP a little more literally/closely as far as structure which fixes some subtle bugs. State is updated in one place and we ensure that the token bucket is always consulted (before the token bucket could be skipped in the case of adaptive retries returning a delay and the adaptive rate limit was updated in multiple branches). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests

This commit fixes the error message to be `Profile definition must start with '['`, which corrects the mistake in the original error message (fixing `]` to be `[`), and adds the single quotes to match the formatting of the error message used when `.strip_suffix(']')` fails (`Profile definition must end with ']'`).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nNo testing is needed here; this is solely a change to a hardcoded error message string.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\nThis is a trivial fix.

This is likely to break _someone_ somewhere due to build requirements changing (e.g. CMake now be required on certain platforms or other build tools needed).\r\n* Updated `aws-config` to default to hyper1 for the default credentials chain.\r\n    * We have two features in `aws-config`, `rustls` and `client-hyper`, that seem to be used entirely to enable the `aws-smithy-runtime` features `tls-rustls` and `connector-hyper-0-14-x` features (both are required for the default HTTP client plugin to work prior to this PR). I think the _intent_ behind these features was \"the user is not providing an HTTP client explicitly so we need a default one to be available\". I've added a new feature to `aws-config` for this, `default-http-connector` and updated the existing features to be synonyms. We don't use `rustls` or `hyper 0.14.x` directly in `aws-config` so I think this is a more clearly defined flag and conveys it's intent better.\r\n* Added a new `legacy-test-util` feature flag to `aws-smithy-runtime`.  The rationale for this is that the `test-util` feature provides testing utilities for other things from `aws-smithy-runtime` but it also brings in the (now) legacy hyper 0.14 HTTP testing facilities. I've left `test-util` to mean what it does today and be backwards compatibile (for now anyway) and  in future we can ship a (breaking) change to disable the legacy test utils by default (and by extension stop compiling the legacy hyper ecosystem in all of our tests)\r\n* Fixed an issue in `examples/pokemon-service-common` due to codegen no longer generating clients with the `aws-smithy-runtime/tls-rustls` feature enabled by default (they are using the `HyperClientBuilder::build_https()` method directly but relying on feature unification to enable the method)\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n* Bikeshed any feature flag names. e.g. `aws-config/default-http-connector` could be more generic like `default-providers` or something.

Context\r\nThis PR introduces the `AwsSdkFeature` enum, which will be used for AWS SDK-specific feature identifiers. For now, it includes a single ID for the S3 Transfer Manager. This approach is similar to the existing [SmithySdkFeature](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/blob/aac9becfd469e2479f68c61fd4c8074ddf755482/rust-runtime/aws-smithy-runtime/src/client/sdk_feature.rs#L10) in terms of its module and crate structure (that is for generic client but `AwsSdkFeature` is AWS specific); the `sdk_feature` module is hidden as it is intended for internal use only.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nAdded an integration test to verify tracking a business metric for Transfer Manager. Since Transfer Manager is a high-level library, we do not track its business metric directly within the `smithy-rs` repository. Instead, [an s3 client](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-s3-transfer-manager-rs/blob/main/aws-s3-transfer-manager/src/config.rs#L21) used in [aws-s3-transfer-manager-rs](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-s3-transfer-manager-rs) can configure the s3 client as demonstrated in the integration test to track the metric.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice._\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3921/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3921/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3920", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3920/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3920/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3920/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3920", "id": 2694955861, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj86DM1VP", "number": 3920, "title": "Add missing lifetime annotation to `EscapedStr::as_escaped_str`", "user": {"login": "drganjoo", "id": 7694697, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTQ2OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7694697?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo", "html_url": "https://github.com/drganjoo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drganjoo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2024-11-26T14:46:13Z", "updated_at": "2024-11-27T15:14:39Z", "closed_at": "2024-11-27T15:14:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/3920", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3920", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3920.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3920.patch", "merged_at": "2024-11-27T15:14:38Z"}, "body": "`JsonTokenIterator` parses and returns `Token`s from a provided u8 slice. `EscapedStr` is used as a member field in several token variants, such as `ObjectKey` and `ValueString`.

Before we just exposed a `CryptoMode` but that is only applicable to rustls. I've swapped this for a new `TlsProvider` concept\r\n* Refactored how connectors are built. Before we were taking a TLS connector and wrapping it (via `Connector`). But this is structurally awkward since our `Connector` is analogous to hyper_utils' [`HttpConnector`](https://docs.rs/hyper-util/latest/hyper_util/client/legacy/connect/struct.HttpConnector.html#) (or supposed to be anyway). The updated structure forces our `Connector` to build the `HttpConnector` (which is the lowest layer/TCP connector) and then (if enabled) wrap it in TLS, and then finally wrap it with the SDK timeouts. \r\n```\r\n// build function returns a connector that looks like this as far as layering goes:\r\nConnector<TlsProviderSelected>.build() -> SdkTimeouts(TlsConnector(HttpConnector))\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Exposed additional builder setting for `TCP_NODELAY` (and defaulted it to true).\r\n* Exposed additional builder setting for binding to a specific NIC\r\n* Fixed feature flags (powerset build was failing locally due to invalid or misconfigured feature flag application)\r\n* Renamed TLS feature flags to be associated with the underlying TLS lib (e.g. `crypto-aws-lc` -> `rustls-aws-lc`)\r\n\r\n**NOTE**:  Apologies in advance, the diff didn't quite come out as I wanted. `client.rs` replaced `hyper_1.rs` (several modules of `hyper_1.rs` were split out into new modules).

`aws/sdk/integration-tests` to use the `test-util` feature(s) directly from `aws-smithy-http-client` rather than `aws-smithy-runtime`\r\n* ~Refactor `aws-smithy-http` to use `http-1.x~\r\n* Fixed an erroneous error message from `imds` credentials provider in passing while tracking down a test failure\r\n* Fixed a few tests that were not immune to environment variables (e.g. on dev desktop `AWS_EC2_METADATA_ENABLED=false` is set by default and was causing some test failures)\r\n\r\nI started pulling at some threads and found them to be quite load bearing (e.g. `inlineable/serialization_settings.rs`) and would require updating all of codegen to use `http-1.x`. ~This PR is a bit of a half step with some stop gaps put into place (e.g. the new `compat` feature of `aws-smithy-http` or inlining a function) to prevent the need to update everything in a single PR. Future PR's will continue where I left off here. ~\r\n\r\nOne lesson I learned the hard way was that our integration test `Cargo.toml` have to reflect codegen. I had updated them to all use `http = \"1\"` and got it all working only to realize codegen generates `http = \"0.2.9\"` and `http-1x = { package = \"http\", version = \"1\"}` and thus the integration tests have to look the same as that.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\n* ~Continue to refactor `aws-smithy-http` to upgrade to `http-body-1.x`. ~\r\n* Refactor codegen to update to `http-1.x`\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I reverted the update to http 1.x for `aws-smithy-http`. This needs to be done and planned with the server and I don't want it to unnecessarily block hyper 1. We will pursue the remaining hyper 1 changes and then make a decision on internal use of http and http-body pre 1.x usage. \r\n\r\n----\r\n_By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice._\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3898/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3898/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3896", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3896/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3896/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/3896/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3896", "id": 2622421061, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj86ATUWq", "number": 3896, "title": "Run `cargo update` on the runtime lockfiles and the SDK lockfile", "user": {"login": "aws-sdk-rust-ci", "id": 97246200, "node_id": "U_kgDOBcvb-A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97246200?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws-sdk-rust-ci", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aws-sdk-rust-ci/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4216857692, "node_id": "LA_kwDOElwhj877WCRc", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/labels/needs-sdk-review", "name": "needs-sdk-review", "color": "E161EF", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2024-10-29T22:07:50Z", "updated_at": "2024-11-05T07:02:23Z", "closed_at": "2024-11-05T07:02:22Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/3896", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3896", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3896.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/3896.patch", "merged_at": "2024-11-05T07:02:22Z"}, "body": "Updating lockfiles introduced `pin-project` `0.2.15`, which revealed [a bug in `cargo-check-external-types`](https://github.com/awslabs/cargo-check-external-types/pull/183).
