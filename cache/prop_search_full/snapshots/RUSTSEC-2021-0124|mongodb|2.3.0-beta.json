"RUST-1337\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the most recent version `tokio-rustls` and/or `rustls` caused a significant performance reduction in the driver when using `rustls`. This seems to have been fixed by switching to using tokio's `AsyncRead` trait for our stream types. I'm not entirely sure why this is the case to be honest, but it seems to work and reduced the code complexity a bit :shrug:. For consistency, I also updated the write ends to use tokio's `AsyncWrite`, though that didn't have any effect on performance. As part of this, we can now remove the dependency on `futures_io`.\r\n\r\nperf patch: https://evergreen.mongodb.com/version/6296cd21d6d80a79a5061a14", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/668/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/668/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/666", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/666/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/666/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/666/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/666", "id": 1244354913, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCvnhg844QDWf", "number": 666, "title": "RUST-1090 Fix serverless tests", "user": {"login": "kmahar", "id": 5976377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzYzNzc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5976377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar", "html_url": "https://github.com/kmahar", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmahar/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-05-22T20:14:12Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-31T02:52:58Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-31T02:52:55Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pulls/666", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/666", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/666.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/666.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-31T02:52:55Z"}, "body": "RUST-1090\r\n\r\nThe original task here was to fix the serverless testing tasks, which had started failing recently after some changes were made to the drivers-evergreen-tools scripts for setting up serverless testing. See DRIVERS-1967 for details, but essentially the required changes for that were:\r\n* update the `SERVERLESS_DRIVERS_GROUP` variable on our Evergreen project\r\n* drivers-evergreen-tools only generates a single URI now, `SERVERLESS_URI`; always use this for serverless tests\r\n* When testing against serverless, ignore `useMultipleMongoses` and always use the `SERVERLESS_URI` / `SINGLE_MONGOS_LB_URI`\r\n* run _all_ unified spec tests against serverless\r\n\r\nThis was quite straightforward in Swift (see https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver/pull/754), but presented some extra challenges in Rust, because as part of DRIVERS-1967 the SERVERLESS_URI was switched to use the `mongodb+srv` scheme. For some historical reasons discussed [here](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/187#issuecomment-635526507), we were not performing SRV resolution when parsing `CLIENT_OPTIONS`, which prevented any client created using `CLIENT_OPTIONS` from connecting to serverless. Our explicit SRV-related tests don't use `CLIENT_OPTIONS` so this wasn't a problem previously, but basically all of our test runners with tests we run against serverless do use it. To work around this, I've switched to using [async_once](https://docs.rs/async_once/latest/async_once/) to allow us to have an async lazy static, and updated tests to use that instead.

version used for compilation for inclusion in the driver handshake metadata.\r\n\r\nPreviously, on a machine where rustc was available the platforms field looked like this:\r\n```\r\n\"rustc 1.60.0 stable (2022-04-04) with tokio\" // stable release\r\n\"rustc 1.62.0 nightly (2022-04-11) with tokio\" // nightly release\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen rustc is not available, this field was null.\r\n\r\nNow, it looks like this (slightly different due to the formatting of `VersionMeta.short_version_string`, but the relevant info is still there and in a similar format):\r\n```\r\n\"rustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04) with tokio\" // stable release\r\n\"rustc 1.62.0-nightly (90ca44752 2022-04-11) with tokio\" // nightly release\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem like we test this at all right now, but I did test manually to get the results I pasted above. I don't think a test would have caught the bug this fixes anyway though, since we always have rustc available when we are running tests. \r\n\r\nFeel free to check yourselves as well.  Note one quirk is that if you switch Rust versions and recompile, it seems `rustc_version_runtime` doesn't get rebuilt, so you have to `cargo clean --package rustc_version_runtime` and rebuild to get that updated.

It also updates the multi export benchmark to use raw BSON, resulting in a speedup.\r\n\r\nI didn't include any new versions of the find one by id benchmark, since using raw BSON didn't actually change anything there. I believe this is due to the test being bottlenecked by network I/O rather than BSON serialization. \r\n\r\nI also didn't include any borrowed deserialization benchmarks for any case, since it also didn't make any noticeable difference. I think we'd need to use a data set that has documents much larger than the tweet one provided with the microbenchmarks.\r\n\r\nLastly, I didn't update the multi-import benchmark to use raw documents, since it currently doesn't result in a speedup due to RUST-1132.\r\n\r\nexample patch: https://evergreen.mongodb.com/version/61bbc5421e2d177b9452baf4\r\n\r\nSome numbers from my machine:\r\n| benchmark                | median iteration time |\r\n|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|\r\n| find many (Document)     | 0.166s                |\r\n| find many (raw BSON)     | 0.022s                |\r\n| find many (serde struct) | 0.068s                |\r\n| find many (C, raw BSON)            | 0.019                 |\r\n| find many (Go, raw BSON)           | 0.012                 |\r\n| find many (Go, bson.M)   | 0.366                 |\r\n\r\nSo overall, performance is quite good (especially serde struct, which used to be 0.15ish but improved due to the internal use of `RawDocumentBuf`), but we are a bit slower than Go and C in the raw BSON case.

This seems to have been fixed by switching to using tokio's `AsyncRead` trait for our stream types. I'm not entirely sure why this is the case to be honest, but it seems to work and reduced the code complexity a bit :shrug:. For consistency, I also updated the write ends to use tokio's `AsyncWrite`, though that didn't have any effect on performance. As part of this, we can now remove the dependency on `futures_io`.\r\n\r\nperf patch: https://evergreen.mongodb.com/version/6296cd21d6d80a79a5061a14", "created_at": "2022-06-01T14:37:14Z",
