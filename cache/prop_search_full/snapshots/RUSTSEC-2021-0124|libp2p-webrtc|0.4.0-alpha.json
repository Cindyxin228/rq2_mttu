UTF8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6055#section-3). \r\n\r\n`dns-parser` looks unmaintained since 2018 and `trust-dns` [supports UTF8](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/blob/main/crates/proto/src/rr/domain/name.rs#L1122-L1126), so while I am not sure this PR will solve the issues above mentioned, it will maybe help

Previously, tests run later in the pipeline would not get run\r\nat all until you make sure the \"first\" one passes.\r\n\r\nWe also previously did not verify the MSRV of each crate, making the\r\nsetting in the `Cargo.toml` rather pointless.\r\n\r\nThe new `cross` job supersedes the existing `wasm` job.\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement because we now also compile the crate for\r\nwindows and MacOS. Something that wasn't checked before.\r\nWe assume that checking MSRV and the tests under Linux is good enough.\r\nHence, this job only checks for compile-errors.\r\n\r\nThe new `feature_matrix` ensures we compile correctly with certain feature combinations.\r\n\r\n`libp2p` exposes a fair few feature-flags. Some of the combinations\r\nare worth checking independently. For the moment, this concerns only\r\nthe executor related transports together with the executor flags but\r\nthis list can easily be extended.\r\n\r\nThe new `clippy` job runs for `stable` and `beta` rust.\r\n\r\nClippy gets continuously extended with new lints. Up until now, we would only\r\nlearn about those as soon as a new version of Rust is released and CI would\r\nrun the new lints. This leads to unrelated failures in CI.

This prevents standalone usage which forces us to depend on `libp2p` in all our tests where we want to derive a `NetworkBehaviour`.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a `prelude` option that - by default - points to `libp2p::swarm::derive_prelude`, a new module added to `libp2p_swarm`. With this config option, users of `libp2p_swarm` can now refer to the macro without depending on `libp2p`, breaking the circular dependency in our workspace. For consistency with the ecosystem, the macro is now also re-exported by `libp2p_swarm` instead of `libp2p` at the same position as the trait that it implements.\r\n\r\nLastly, we introduce an off-by-default `macros` feature flag that shrinks the dependency tree for users that don't need the derive macro.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3055/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3055/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051", "id": 1417930545, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBSHhDc5BQ-lS", "number": 3051, "title": "build(deps): Update multiaddr requirement from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2340311223, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQwMzExMjIz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "0366d6", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update a dependency file"}, {"id": 2527056927, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI3MDU2OTI3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/rust", "name": "rust", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update Rust code"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-10-21T08:03:43Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-02T12:57:36Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-02T12:57:22Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/3051", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051.patch", "merged_at": "2022-11-02T12:57:22Z"}, "body": "Updates the requirements on [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr/releases\">multiaddr's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.15.0</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a> for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">multiaddr's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>0.15.0 [2022-10-20]</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>WebRTC</code> instance for <code>Multiaddr</code>.

Currently, users of libp2p need to activate a separate feature for each sub-crate that is specific to the executor they want to use, i.e. `tcp-tokio`, `dns-tokio`, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we deprecate these features in favor of a single `tokio` and `async-std` feature. Thanks to cargo's support for weak-features, we can forward the respective executor feature to each sub-crate without pulling them in as dependencies unless the user also activated the corresponding protocol (`dns`, `tcp` etc).\r\n\r\nDeprecation warnings don't work on re-exports so I had to (temporarily) define a new module in `lib.rs`.
