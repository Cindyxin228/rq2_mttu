For standalone users of `libp2p-mplex`, the substreams itself are\r\nnow useful, similar to `libp2p-yamux` and don't necessarily need to\r\nbe polled via the `StreamMuxer`.

Not ready for review yet._</s>\r\n\r\nRemove the concept of `Listener`s from the `Transport` trait. Instead require the Transport itself to implement a stream-like API with `Transport::poll`. Transport implementations can then internally implement the logic for managing one or multiple listeners.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this change is that the concept of multiple listeners is rather TCP specific and introduces unnecessary complexity for the QUIC transport (https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2289#issuecomment-1119872606). \r\nApart from that, this generally follows the same direction as #2648 :\r\n> 2. Follow the style of \"mutate state and return result via poll\", same as we do for many other parts of rust-libp2p\r\n\r\nThe change includes:\r\n- Remove `Transport::Listener` and change `Transport::listen_on` to just return a `Result<ListenerId, _>`\r\n- Add `Transport::poll`, which returns `TransportEvent`s  (replacing the former `swarm/connection/ListenersEvent). Listeners should be driven here. \r\n- Remove `swarm/connection/ListenersStream`, instead poll the boxed transport directly in the swarm\r\n- Adapt transports/tcp: Wrap the `GenTcpConfig` into a new struct `GenTcpTransport` that implements `Transport`:\r\n   - Manage multiple listener streams (this is essentially the logic that used to be in `swarm/connection/ListenersStream`\r\n- Adapt some of the existing Transports to this (not all yet, but that's only because I'd like to discuss the general direction first, not because I have concerns with specific transports)\r\n- Adapt tests of transports/tcp, core and swarm to this change -> tests pass\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nRelevant discussions:\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2529#issuecomment-1087384988\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions/2113#discussioncomment-944923\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2289#issuecomment-1119872606\r\n- similar direction as #2648 \r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n**Transport::dial**\r\n\r\nI did not change how `Transport::dial` works. I originally planned to also remove `Transport::Dial` and push that logic into `Transport::poll` as well. The problem with this would be that it does not work well with the concurrent-dial logic. \r\n `ConcurrentDial` currently drives multiple dial futures (from potentially multiple transports) at the same time. Once the first succeeds, it drops the other ongoing dials. If the Transport would internally manage the `Dial` future, this logic would not work anymore. What we could do is something like the following:\r\n  - Each dial is associated with a `DialId`, `ConcurrentDial` tracks the dial-ids of concurrent dials\r\n  - We add `Transport::abort_dial` that can be called from the `Pool` once the first dial of a concurrent dialing batch succeeds\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is worth the extra complexity. Happy to hear alternative suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Open TODOs\r\n- [x] Add `Transport::remove_listener`\r\n- [x] Track listening addresses\r\n- [x] Adapt all remaining transports to the change \r\n- [x] Clean code, Fix docs\r\n- [x] (not part of this PR, but should be done before merging this) draft how the QUIC implementation of #2289 could be adapted to this change (CC @kpp)\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] A changelog entry has been made in the appropriate crates\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2652/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2652/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646", "id": 1234319511, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBSHhDc43vOaN", "number": 2646, "title": "Set Metrics as weak dependency", "user": {"login": "maschad", "id": 9755286, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk3NTUyODY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9755286?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad", "html_url": "https://github.com/maschad", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2022-05-12T18:05:49Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-10T16:36:29Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-10T16:36:29Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/2646", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-10T16:36:29Z"}, "body": "# Description\r\nUpgraded to [1.60.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html) in order to enable metrics as a _weak dependency_  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8832\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2286\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.
