platform-specific logic in files. The goal of this commit is\r\nto consolidate all platform-specific functionality into one location to\r\nmake it easier to port Wasmtime to new systems. This commit creates a\r\n`sys` module within the `wasmtime-runtime` crate which conditionally\r\ndefines all of the platform support that Wasmtime requires, namely\r\nthings related to virtual memory management and trap handling. Many of\r\nthe previous `unix.rs` files interspersed throughout the tree are now\r\nall located in a single `unix` directory. This additionally helps split\r\nout `miri`-specific functionality by pretending `miri` is its own\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nThis change additionally goes through `#[cfg]` directives throughout\r\n`wasmtime-runtime`, `wasmtime-jit`, and `wasmtime` itself to place all\r\nof this target-specific functionality within this `sys` directory. The\r\nend state is that there are two new top-level modules in the\r\n`wasmtime-runtime` crate:\r\n\r\n* `arch` - this conditionally defines architecture-specific logic such\r\n  as the state used by backtraces, libcalls, etc.\r\n* `sys` - this conditionally defines OS or platform-specific logic such\r\n  as virtual memory management.\r\n\r\nOne secondary goal of this commit is to enable the ability to easily\r\nadd new platforms to Wasmtime, even if it's in a fork of Wasmtime.\r\nPreviously patches might have to touch a good number of locations where\r\nnow they'd ideally only have to touch `sys/mod.rs` to declare a new\r\nplatform and `sys/$platform/*.rs` to define all the functionality.", "reactions": {"url":

This includes WIT interfaces which are not specified in `wasi:http/proxy` such as `wasi:filesystem/types`, aka access to a filesystem.\r\n\r\nThis commit slims down `wasmtime serve` to, by default, only supporting the `wasi:http/proxy` world. Like with `wasmtime run` various CLI flags can be passed to enable more interfaces, however:\r\n\r\n* `-Scommon` - this enables \"common\" interfaces such as `wasi:filesystem`, `wasi:sockets`, and `wasi:cli/*`.\r\n* `-Snn` - this enables wasi-nn\r\n\r\nIt's expected that more will get extended here over time too.\r\n\r\nThis change is enabled by a third build of the adapter, a \"proxy\" mode. In this mode most functions are cfg'd to return `ERRNO_NOTSUP` to indicate that the runtime does not support it. Notably this includes the filesystem, arguments, and environment variables.\r\n\r\nThis change is tested by updating all `api_proxy*` tests to use this new adapter which is now required that many previous interfaces are no longer present by default in the proxy world.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure you include the following information:\r\n\r\n- If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that\r\n  conversation.

The root cause of the issue is the behavior of casting a smaller integer to a larger integer and switching signs. For example casting an i8 to a u32. I certainly don't remember whether this is a zero-extend or a sign-extend, and I suspect that I'm not alone. Ideally I was looking for a lint to help weed these out on CI. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately rustc does not have a lint for this. Clippy, however, has a somewhat similar lint called `cast_sign_loss`. Empowered with Rust's 1.74 release and Cargo's addition of a `[lints]` configuration for workspaces, I realized this seemed like a reasonable time to kick the tires. Historically Wasmtime hasn't enabled Clippy because it's too noisy by default and it's too cumbersome to turn it off for all crates. With `[lints]` however it's a single line to turn off all clippy for the entire workspace, which felt like a much better balance to me at least.\r\n\r\nFirst configuring `[lints]` as well as `[workspace.lints]` helped moved some lint configuration for various crates into one location. Afterwards all clippy lints were then disabled and then `cargo clippy` was added to CI. It turns out that `cast_sign_loss` is still too noisy for our purposes to enable for the whole workspace, but it can be selectively enabled for a few crates in question which do at least much of the casting for values at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be somewhat of a trial run to see if we can make running Clippy in CI useful. I'm sure Clippy has other useful lints for helping to catch issues as well as helping with stylistic things for contributors. For now everything is left disabled but if desired selective lints can be enabled as necessary.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7561/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7561/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7555", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7555/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7555/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7555/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7555", "id": 1999504243, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBhDaXM5fxVcu", "number": 7555, "title": "Update hyper dependency to stable release", "user": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-17T16:31:01Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T17:33:21Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-17T17:33:20Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pulls/7555", "html_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7555", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7555.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7555.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-17T17:33:20Z"}, "body": "This updates hyper to 1.0.0 and handles the various updates necessary along with a few other dependency updates.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure you include the following information:\r\n\r\n- If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that\r\n  conversation.
