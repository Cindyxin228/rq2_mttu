If this does offer performance improvements, I expect these will only be in isolated cases, therefore it may be best to use a feature flag (e.g. `perf_error_size`) to implement this (there are no breaking changes other than `msg` and `fmt` having different results).\r\n\r\nWe can avoid adding a `std` feature to `rand_os` as in #771 by using `From<getrandom::Error>`. (We could use a special function including a message, but I don't think there's much point.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this moves the `from_entropy` function as previously discussed and changes a few docs

The implementation of `Float` in the first commit doesn't look bad, but we see in the second it is growing quickly.\r\n\r\nOne motivation is to avoid a dependency on an unstable lib (there appear to be suggestions the trait should change). Another is to avoid requiring `.unwrap()` on `N::from(..)`, although as implemented here we use `as` which isn't exactly safe (we could instead restrict input precision and use `From<f32>`).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/793/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/793/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/792", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/792/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/792/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/792/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/792", "id": 441199276, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjc2NTcxNzkx", "number": 792, "title": "Use ChaCha20 in StdRng and feature-gate SmallRng", "user": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/milestones/2", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/milestone/2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/milestones/2/labels", "id": 3593578, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzU5MzU3OA==", "number": 2, "title": "0.7 release", "description": "Potential scope: distributions", "creator": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 10, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2018-08-23T13:21:58Z", "updated_at": "2019-09-13T18:29:59Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2019-09-13T18:29:59Z"}, "comments": 28, "created_at": "2019-05-07T12:14:25Z", "updated_at": "2019-06-04T08:23:05Z", "closed_at": "2019-06-03T17:08:16Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/pulls/792", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/792", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/792.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/792.patch", "merged_at": "2019-06-03T17:08:16Z"}, "body": "Following #789, we change the `StdRng` algorithm.

I do not think this will impact many users, and switching to `rand_jitter` is easy enough for those people.\r\n\r\nThis does *not* deprecate `FromEntropy`, which is simply sugar for `from_rng(OsRng).unwrap()`. This trait already has some usage. We could move the method to `SeedableRng` but this requires dependence on `getrandom` from `rand_core`; I'm not sure if it is justified.\r\n\r\nReview @newpavlov?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/765/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/765/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/761", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/761/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/761/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/761/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/761", "id": 426096796, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjY1MDMyODA5", "number": 761, "title": "New rand_distr crate", "user": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 10, "created_at": "2019-03-27T17:38:39Z", "updated_at": "2019-04-03T14:17:27Z", "closed_at": "2019-04-03T11:25:52Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/pulls/761", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/761", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/761.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-random/rand/pull/761.patch", "merged_at": "2019-04-03T11:25:52Z"}, "body": "- adds a new `rand_distr` crate with a copy of distributions being moved\r\n- deprecates all \"moved\" distributions\r\n- removes re-exports of `distribution::weighted::*` items (breaking!)\r\n- doc improvements for both `rand::distributions` module and `rand_distr` top-level\r\n- a few minor fixes\r\n\r\nIncluding two copies of all these distributions is unfortunate but avoids tricky coupling and is only temporary.
