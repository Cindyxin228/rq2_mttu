Effectively this means that any user of Rune should be able to implement a rigorous memory sandbox that can take untrusted input and stay within defined memory limits.\r\n\r\nCC LemmyNet/lemmy#3277\r\n\r\n# Caveats and missing pieces\r\n\r\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of types and operations which are still not covered by the allocator:\r\n* The stack is currently not limited. So sufficiently nested code could use up unsupervised amounts of memory.\r\n* Allocation metadata **is not** accounted for, so in particular many small allocations might end up using up more system memory than what is being accounted for. This plugs in at the Rust allocated level, and uses the global allocation APIs which are currently [provided in stable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/fn.alloc.html). This could eventually be remedied using a custom allocator, or by using an allocator which reports overhead.\r\n* CLI arguments. This is not critical since the CLI is usually not fed untrusted input.\r\n* Sorting using `[_]::sort`, which uses timsort that might [allocate a cache up to half the size of the elements being sorted](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort).\r\n* `Path` / `PathBuf`.\r\n* `RelativePath` / `RelativePathBuf`.\r\n* I/O related functions that returns a buffer, such as `std::fs::read_to_string`.\r\n* Anything using serde. While any types we convert into will take allocated memory into account (and error through serde accordingly) serializations might use internal buffering which bypasses this, such as `serde_json` using a string buffer. [Owned types](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/de/trait.Visitor.html#method.visit_byte_buf) being passed in are not accounted for until they've been converted to internal types.\r\n* So far `Rc` and `Arc` have not been forked. Mainly because their memory overhead is fixed and relative to other collections which store them internally, We might still decide to fork them to ensure that we get full coverage.\r\n* A few more internal uses of `std` / `alloc` types such as `String` and `Vec` which just haven't been ported yet because they're not considered important.\r\n\r\nAll of these can easily be dealt with except serde. It's up to the serialization format to construct owned buffers and this is not something we can control. When this feature is released there will be a warning associated with all serialization modules (currently `json` and `toml`).\r\n\r\nThe other APIs will be copied into `rune_alloc` and given appropriate implementations which uses the `rune_alloc` allocator API.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rune-rs/rune/issues/632/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

This means that:\r\n* Errors generated from them will always be consistent, like for context errors where an item is ambiguous.\r\n* Documentation generated will always list items in their declaration order.\r\n\r\nThe second large change is that the way generics are looked up has changed. Previously looking up a free generic method wouldn't fail until runtime. Now when possible it will fail at compile time instead. Note that generic functions can only be defined in native contexts.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n\r\nDeriving `Any` now requires that you specify the correct item the type belongs to. Its item must correspond to the module it's being installed in.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Any)]\r\n#[rune(item = ::process)]\r\nstruct Process {\r\n    /* .. */\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn install() -> Result<rune::Module, rune::ContextError> {\r\n    let mut module = rune::Module::with_crate(\"process\");\r\n    module.ty::<Process>()?;\r\n    Ok(module)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMacros now take paths and identifiers instead of strings, so this:\r\n* `#[rune(name = \"Foo\")]` is `#[rune(name = Foo)]`.\r\n* `#[rune(install_with = \"path::to::function\")]` is `#[rune(name = path::to::function)]`.\r\n*
