We now have a bunch of utility crates like\r\n- autoformatting\r\n- rsx as a library not a proc macro\r\n- hot reload as a library feature\r\n- JS interpreter as a Rust crate\r\n\r\nThis is good because we can keep the ecosystem of tooling in lockstep with dioxus core as it evolves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts the translation feature of the CLI into a single \"Rosetta\" crate that provides transformation of any syntax into the Dioxus `rsx` syntax tree which is the foundation of hot reload, autoformat, etc.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal here is to provide frontends for any neighbor project (JSX, yew/sycamore/leptos, slint, etc etc) to take advantage of the tooling we've developed. It should also allow seamless imports of existing projects into Dioxus. This functionality powers the HTML-to-RSX translation today, but it could be easily expanded to allow JSX-to-RSX.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/686/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/686/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/668", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/668/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/668/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/668/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/668", "id": 1503878933, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE6gVKM5F1Qho", "number": 668, "title": "chore: rollback to option instead of anyhow", "user": {"login": "jkelleyrtp", "id": 10237910, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM3OTEw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10237910?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp", "html_url": "https://github.com/jkelleyrtp", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkelleyrtp/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-12-20T02:06:34Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-20T05:09:22Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-20T05:09:21Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pulls/668", "html_url": "https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/668", "diff_url": "https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/668.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/668.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-20T05:09:21Z"}, "body": "After trying to use the error handling with anyhow, I don't really think it's worth the breaking change.\r\n\r\nError boundaries are best paired with exceptions.

pretty easy to implement your own LiveViewSocket.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// Convert a warp websocket into a LiveViewSocket\r\n///\r\n/// This is required to launch a LiveView app using the warp web

nearest suspense boundary until ready\r\n- The virtualdom can now order changes for different renderers in the same stream, unlocking multiwindow desktop apps\r\n- unterminated if/then and for loops with rsx bodies (experimental, may revert this)\r\n- internal tasks and futures are way more efficient, using their own dedicated waker \r\n- SSR now has a cache for all static content it's seen before, making it much faster\r\n- hooks don't need to create a reference. IE `use_state(cx, ` works automatically now\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n- [x] SSR Cache\r\n- [ ] Finish cleaning up SSR crate and overhaul its docs and APIs\r\n- [x] Rip out old vnode in favor of template-only vnode\r\n- [x] implement `create` method with templates\r\n- [x] implement async components\r\n- [x] implement suspense boundaries\r\n- [x] a dedicated waker for futures inside the dom that doesn't require Rc\r\n- [x] Sanitize method on mutations to wipe template IDs for testing\r\n- [x] fix pointer stability issues with new bumpslab crate\r\n- [x] get diffing working\r\n- - [x] Basic template <-> template\r\n- - [x] Old template to new template light internal diffing\r\n- - [ ] handle async rollover\r\n- - [ ] handle error boundary rollover\r\n- [x] rework garbage collection\r\n- [ ] wire up subtrees into resume logic\r\n- [x] Element is no longer Option<T> but anyhow::Result<T>\r\n- [ ] Error boundaries and render cancelling\r\n\r\nTests\r\n- [x] We don't hand out null ptrs\r\n- [x] creating text\r\n- [x] creating elements\r\n- [x] creating fragments\r\n- [x] Creating placeholders\r\n- [x] Tasks get polled\r\n- [x] Components pass through their children\r\n- [x] creating suspense\r\n- [ ] Errors get bubbled to a suspense boundary\r\n- [ ] Errored components cancel their render\r\n- [x] Diffing templates with just components\r\n- [x] Dynamic-only templates don't generate CreateTemplate mutations\r\n- [x] Diffing templates with the same ID\r\n- [x] Diffing templates with different IDs should light diff and then replace\r\n- [x] Mounting dynamic roots should not use LoadTemplate\r\n- [x] Unkeyed diffing ordering\r\n- [x] Keyed diffing ordering\r\n- [x] No leaking when the virtualdom is dropped\r\n- [x] Drop safety before running listeners\r\n- [x] Suspended components should not respond to user events\r\n- [ ] Rolling from nodes to async nodes should not wipe the old tree - render gen doesn't advance\r\n\r\nFuture todo\r\n- rework some docs\r\n- blog posts on the changes\r\n- transition components\r\n- Default error screen?
