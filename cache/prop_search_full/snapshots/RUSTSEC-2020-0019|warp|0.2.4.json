An adapter\r\ncan convert `log::Record`s into `tracing::Event`s to be consumed by a\r\n`tracing` subscriber, and a `tracing` feature flag can be enabled to\r\nemit `log` records from `tracing`'s macros. \r\n\r\nHowever, `tracing`'s system for filtering what spans and events should\r\nbe recorded is more efficient than the `log` crate's filtering in many\r\ncases, since it allows filtering decisions to be cached at the callsite,\r\navoiding a call to a filtering function that may, for example, perform\r\nstring matching. This benefit is only available when events are emitted\r\nnatively from `tracing`'s macros, rather than converted by an adapter\r\nfrom `log::Record`s, because `log`'s records lack static callsites.\r\n\r\nThis branch migrates Warp's internal diagnostics to use `tracing` rather\r\nthan `log`. In general, the `tracing` macros are drop-in compatible with\r\n`log`, so the migration only requires changing what crate the macros are\r\nimported from. Tracing's \"log\" feature flag is enabled, causing all the\r\n`tracing` macros to emit `log` records if no `tracing` subscriber has\r\nbeen set. This means that the logs currently emitted for `log` users\r\nshould be unchanged, while `tracing` users should see small performance\r\nimprovements. I've also added a few `tracing` spans to provide context\r\nfor some of the events Warp emits.\r\n\r\nFuture work could involve:\r\n* making the events warp emits more structured, so that they emit \r\n  `tracing`'s structured key-value fields rather than textual messages\r\n* adding more spans to provide context to Warp's events\r\n* adding filters for emitting traces from applications (PR #656)\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Eliza Weisman <eliza@buoyant.io>", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/655/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":
