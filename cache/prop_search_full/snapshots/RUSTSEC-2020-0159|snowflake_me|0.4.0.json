Summary\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. **Bump Version to 0.3.0**\r\n   - Updated the version in `Cargo.toml` from `0.2.2` to `0.3.0`.\r\n\r\n2. **Error Handling for Missing Identifiers without ip-fallback**\r\n   - Modified the `Builder`'s `finalize` method to return an error when `machine_id` or `data_center_id` are not provided and the `ip-fallback` feature is disabled.\r\n   - Ensured that `machine_id` and `data_center_id` default to `None` in the `new` method.\r\n   - Added conditional compilation to handle the `ip-fallback` feature correctly.\r\n\r\n3. **Update GitHub Actions Configuration**\r\n   - Modified the GitHub Actions configuration to support running on branches matching `feature/**`.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n- The `Builder` struct now provides clear error messages if essential identifiers are missing and the `ip-fallback` feature is not enabled.\r\n- This ensures that users are well-informed about configuration issues, improving the overall robustness of the library.\r\n- The CI configuration now supports feature branches, enhancing the development workflow.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- Related issue:
