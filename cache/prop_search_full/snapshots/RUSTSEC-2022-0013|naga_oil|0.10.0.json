part::of::path\r\n...\r\npath::remainder::function();\r\n```\r\nwhich will call to `part::of::path::remainder::function`\r\n\r\n- use fully qualified paths without importing:\r\n```\r\n// #import

think this style should be deprecated)\r\n// #import bevy_pbr::pbr_functions pbr\r\n...\r\npbr()\r\n```\r\n\r\n- existing code should work without changes (unless it uses `#import`ed overrides), see below\r\n\r\n- allows most imported items to end with `_` and numbers (#30). still doesn't allow struct members to end with `_` or numbers but it's progress. \r\n\r\n- includes (a reworking of) #39\r\n\r\n- supercedes #24 and #25\r\n\r\n- partly breaks overrides - now overrides will only be applied if the overriding module is added as an additional import in the arguments to `Composer::make_naga_module` or `Composer::add_composable_module`. this is necessary to support determining whether imports are modules or items. i think it's a worthwhile trade-off (not sure anybody is using overrides yet)\r\n\r\ni've spot-checked bevy, will test more thoroughly after some feedback. would very much appreciate tests from people using the crate outside of bevy core - @DGriffin91,

`const_expressions` and `const_expr_map` - this is basically unavoidable, as `DerivedModule::import_expression` needs access to both the `const_expressions` and the arena to import into, which may also be `const_expressions`\r\n- don't emit `Expression::Literal` and `Expression::ZeroValue`s\r\n- enforce `const_expression` uniqueness with a custom impl of `PartialEq` for `Expression`s, to ensure that the uniqueness test for globals and consts still passes (else we end up with duplicated items, they no longer test as equal as they refer to different `init` expressions). this could be removed if the `PartialEq` derive on `Expression` in naga is made externally available.\r\n- a basic port of the `prune` module which just leaves all `const_expressions` present\r\n\r\nthe tests pass, but i
