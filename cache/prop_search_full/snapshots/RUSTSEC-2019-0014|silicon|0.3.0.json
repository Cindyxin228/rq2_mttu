It can replace\n>   the bunch of free functions: `image::{load_*, open, image_dimensions}` while\n>   enabling new combinations such as `open` but with format deduced from content\n>   instead of file path.\n> - Fixed `const_err` lint in the macro expanded implementations of `Pixel`. This\n>   can only affect your crate if `image` is used as a path dependency.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- [`9aae0b0`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/9aae0b0ce1eae36558c3f7d636f5814ffd49a11f) Merge pull request [#1051](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1051) from HeroicKatora/master\n- [`bdf2d4c`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/bdf2d4c7c713213966797081af8ea5b8d78c31ac) Remark const_err in changelog\n- [`0f1dcd1`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/0f1dcd1a629d44984b9476a9206bf8ca6c0655ac) Merge pull request [#1047](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1047) from JohnTitor/use-match\n- [`1e7ce10`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/1e7ce107261be9e5d9088f3f3bd34ca3928dc5d3) Merge pull request [#1049](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1049) from HeroicKatora/const-err\n- [`684089b`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/684089bdf00f2695d05ee93957bc26f66678d0ba) Fix strict const_err\n- [`0153ddd`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/0153ddd10061f538aea4659edfa6ebec1873a6ba) Merge pull request [#1050](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1050) from mathstuf/target-as-symlink\n- [`18df3b2`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/18df3b2f5c2ad4e5c2fe2aae5067ac3e97ab8ca2) gitignore: ignore target as a symlink\n- [`06ea11d`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/06ea11d0860cd65b009ce792752c09d6df700bcf) Merge pull request [#1048](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1048) from HeroicKatora/build-system\n- [`5a03954`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/5a03954c136a00707760ff6fa795c967d6682a93) Test for env set, not non-zero\n- [`f0bef52`](https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/f0bef52a9e79e83bd002ab80f658ef22f09807cb) Make default features the default build again\n- Additional commits viewable in [compare view](https://github.com/image-rs/image/compare/v0.22.2...v0.22.3)\n</details>\n<br />\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=image&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.22.2&new-version=0.22.3)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score.html?dependency-name=image&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.22.2&new-version=0.22.3)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/master/crates/spin/RUSTSEC-0000-0000.toml).*\n\n> **Wrong memory orderings in RwLock potentially violates mutual exclusion**\n> Wrong memory orderings inside the RwLock implementation allow for two writers to acquire the lock at the same time. The drop implementation used Ordering::Relaxed, which allows the compiler or CPU to reorder a mutable access on the locked data after the lock has been yielded.\n> \n> Only users of the RwLock implementation are affected. Users of Once (including users of lazy_static with the `spin_no_std` feature enabled) are NOT affected.\n> \n> On strongly ordered CPU architectures like x86, the only real way that this would lead to a memory corruption is if the compiler reorders an access after the lock is yielded, which is possible but in practice unlikely. It is a more serious issue on weakly ordered architectures such as ARM which, except in the presence of certain instructions, allow the hardware to decide which accesses are seen at what times. Therefore on an ARM system it is likely that using the wrong memory ordering would result in a memory corruption, even if the compiler itself doesn't reorder the memory accesses in a buggy way.\n>  \n> The flaw was corrected by https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mvdnes/spin-rs/pull/66.\n> \n> Patched versions: >= 0.5.2\n> Unaffected versions: none\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- See full diff in [compare view](https://github.com/mvdnes/spin-rs/commits)\n</details>\n<br />\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=spin&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.5.0&new-version=0.5.2)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score.html?dependency-name=spin&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.5.0&new-version=0.5.2)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
