If a message is received for an object not assigned to any filter the result depends on the side:\r\n  - client-side, the message is given to a generic callback that the user has to provide to the `dispatch` methods. The client can thus decide to handle some messages manually rather than via the callbacks.\r\n  - server-side, a message is printed to stderr, and the client is killed with a protocol error message indicating of a server bug.\r\n- client-side, the multithreading handling is done using the new `Main<I>` and `Attached<I>` type (in addition of the `Proxy<I>`/`I` already existing):\r\n  - `Main<I>` is the initial created handle, it is not `Send`, and can be used to send any request and change the proxy assignation to a filter. It cannot exist on an other thread than the one hosting the event queue managing the proxy.\r\n  - `Proxy<I>` is the most shareable handle. It is `Send`, but can only be used to send requests that do *not* create new objects.\r\n  - `Attached<I>` can be created from a `Proxy<I>` by \"attaching\" the handle to an event queue. It can be used to send any requests, and requests creating new objects will have these new objects managed by the event queue the handle is \"attached\" to. It is not `Send`.\r\n- Server-side, there is a `Main<I>` as well. Event dispatching & assigning filters can only be done from the thread hosting the `Display`, which is still not threadsafe.\r\n- Client-side: creating a new connection does no longer automatically create a new event queue. You need to create you own, and attach a handle of the `WlDisplay` to it to get your `WlRegistry`.\r\n- User-data is now represented as a `UserData` type, with `set`/`get` methods. It can only be set once and handles thread-safety correctly.\r\n- the `native_lib` feature is renamed to `use_system_lib`, to be more explicit\r\n- client-side: `wayland-cursor` and `wayland-egl` are split into their own crates\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] polish & uniformize the API\r\n- [x] Update the documentation\r\n- [x] Erase any trace of the event loop abstraction to fully decouple the crate
