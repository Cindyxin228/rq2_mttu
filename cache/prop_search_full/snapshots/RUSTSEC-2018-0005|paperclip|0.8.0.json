Tagged scalars, sequences, and mappings are all supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An empty YAML input (or document containing only comments) will deserialize successfully to an empty map, empty sequence, or Serde struct as long as the struct has only optional fields. Previously this would error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code>.apply_merge()</code> method on <code>Value</code> implements YAML's <code>&lt;&lt;</code> merge key convention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Debug</code> representation of <code>serde_yaml::Value</code> has gotten vastly better (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/pull/287\">dtolnay/serde-yaml#287</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deserialization of borrowed strings now works.</p>\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct Struct&lt;'a&gt; {\n    borrowed: &amp;'a str,\n}\n<p>let yaml = &quot;borrowed: 'k\u00f6lcs\u00f6nz\u00f6tt'\\n&quot;;\nlet value: Struct = serde_yaml::from_str(yaml)?;\nprintln!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, value);\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Value</code>'s and <code>Mapping</code>'s methods <code>get</code> and <code>get_mut</code> have been generalized to support a &amp;str argument, as opposed to requiring you to allocate and construct a <code>Value::String</code> for indexing into another existing <code>Value</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Mapping</code> exposes more APIs that have become conventional on map data structures, such as <code>.keys()</code>, <code>.values()</code>, <code>.into_keys()</code>, <code>.into_values()</code>, <code>.values_mut()</code>, and <code>.retain(|k, v| \u2026)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Serialization no longer produces leading <code>---\\n</code> on the serialized output. You can prepend this yourself if your use case demands it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Serialization of enum variants is now based on YAML's <code>!Tag</code> syntax, rather than JSON-style singleton maps.</p>\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\nenum Enum {\n    Newtype(usize),\n    Tuple(usize, usize, usize),\n    Struct { x: f64, y: f64 },\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>- !Newtype 1\n- !Tuple [0, 0, 0]\n- !Struct {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

fix #357, but uses an alternative approach to #358.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the behaviour will be as follows:\r\n```rs\r\nmod foo {\r\n    pub mod bar {\r\n        use paperclip::actix::{web, api_v2_operation, Apiv2Schema};\r\n        use serde::Serialize;\r\n\r\n        #[derive(Serialize, Apiv2Schema)]\r\n        pub struct Response {\r\n            bar: i32\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        #[api_v2_operation]\r\n        pub fn b() -> web::Json<Response> {\r\n            web::Json(Response { bar: 10 })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nresults in the following spec:\r\n```yaml\r\n  foo_bar_Response:\r\n    type: object\r\n    properties:\r\n      bar:\r\n        type: integer\r\n        format: int32\r\n    required:\r\n      - bar\r\n...\r\n          schema:\r\n            $ref: '#/definitions/foo_bar_Response' \r\n```\r\nThe advantage of this PR over #358 is that the generated spec is always the same for the same input code.\r\n\r\nThe name is determined by taking the output of `std::module_path!()`, removing the first 'component' (i.e. the crate name), then joining with `_` as a separator.\r\n\r\nThis **will not** break code backwards compatibility, but it **will** break spec backwards compatibility, i.e. the generated spec is different from how it would be without this PR", "reactions": {"url":

This lets you convert integer values to your enum.

If you had manually implemented <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for your enum, this will cause a conflict. You\ncan probably remove your manual implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/189\">#189</a> Use <code>core::result::Result</code> instead of <code>std::result::Result</code>.

This lets you convert integer values to your enum. If you specify a #[repr(..)] attribute on your enum, or use\nan explicit discriminant, this will be incorporated into the derive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>from_repr</code> will be <code>const</code> if you use a recent rust version.</li>\n<li>This cannot be a trait method currently because only inherent methods support <code>const</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/186\">#186</a> Automatically implement <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for enums that implement <code>EnumString</code>.\nThis is only enabled for rustc &gt;= 1.34 which is when `TryFrom was stabilized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a small breaking change. If you had manually implemented <code>TryFrom&lt;str&gt;</code> for your enum, this will cause a conflict. You\ncan probably remove your manual implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/189\">#189</a> Use <code>core::result::Result</code> instead of <code>std::result::Result</code>. This should be\nmore portable in no-std environments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.22.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/180\">#180</a>: Deprecates <code>ToString</code> derive. You should use <code>Display</code>\ninstead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/178\">#178</a>: Deprecates AsStaticStr. This has been undocumented for a while.\nThe recommended method is to derive <code>IntoStaticStr</code> instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/171\">#171</a>: Improve <code>no-std</code> support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/170\">#170</a>: enable changing the path to strum traits. This is necessary\nif you re-export strum as a submodule in another crate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.21.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/164\">#164</a> Improve compatibility with older versions of <code>syn</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.21.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Replace <code>std::</code> with <code>core::</code> to support no-std projects. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/145\">#145</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breaking Changes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MSRV is updated to 1.32 because <code>heck</code> does not work in <code>1.31.1</code> anymore. Rust 1.32 came out Jan 2019 so hopefully\nteams have moved to an equal or newer version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/149\">#149</a> Remove the &quot;rename&quot; feature. In Rust 2018, macros should be\nimported using a qualified path to avoid collisions. <code>strum_macros::EnumString</code> rather than using the &quot;Rename&quot;\nfeature to avoid collisions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/160\">#160</a> enum messages: Make the returned values all 'static\n<ul>\n<li>It is unlikely this will break anyone, but the new signature for functions generated by EnumMessage\nis <code>fn get_message(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'static str&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for ascii_case_insensitive string comparisons. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/157\">#157</a>\nThis feature allows <code>FromString</code> impls to match strings that differ in case from the expected variant.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
