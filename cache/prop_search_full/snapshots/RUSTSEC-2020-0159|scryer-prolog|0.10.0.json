Offset table lookups must now be performed explicitly instead of implicitly, which the `read_heap_cell!` macro no longer does. The machine can migrate the table data from `Serial` to `Concurrent` when spawning a new thread from the parent machine thread for the first time and back from `Concurrent` to `Serial` again once all child machine threads have been joined / offset table access can safely happen without synchronization once more. This addresses the performance issue raised in #2908 in single-threaded Scryer.\r\n\r\nI've created this PR instead of merging the commit directly to `rebis-dev` because I'm not sure I've implemented it quite right. Previously the offset table had type `Arcu<RawBlock<OffsetTableImpl<T>>, GlobalEpochCounter>` instead of `Arc<RawBlock<T>, GlobalEpochCounter>`, for instance. I don't know why `OffsetTableImpl<T>` appeared recursively in that type but I'm sure there was a reason.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate feedback from @Skgland particularly, as the author of the `arcu` crate, and anyone else who cares to weigh in on this or any other potential problems in this PR.

This is needed for eventually running the CLI toplevel in Scryer Playground. Doing this properly depends on #2799, and I will do that in another PR. Just having access to queries is already powerful enough for the vast majority of use cases.\r\n- Settle on a serialization.

These are also applications of Wasm I think we should tackle eventually, but this PR is concerned specifically with embedding Scryer Prolog in Javascript (the browser and things like NodeJS).
