been working on adding the possibility to import Vulkano textures into OpenGL.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few bugs in Vulkano currently prevent this functionality from working correctly:\r\n\r\n- The memory builder was not populating its p_next structures at all, meaning memory was created neither as exportable or dedicated. I fixed this by getting rid of the old method of populating the p_next structures and instead using the Ash functionality.\r\n- The exportable image must also be created with an additional structure [VkExternalImageCreateInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo.html). I added a method to `UnsafeImage` which does this, and I used it accordingly in `AttachmentImage`.\r\n- Issue 17 of OpenGL [EXT_external_objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_external_objects.txt) demands that the mutable bit be set when some common extensions are present. I thus set it to true by default, but perhaps @hakolao can provide his input on whether this would make sense when sharing images with CUDA.\r\n\r\nThe result of these issues was heavy visual corruption on the AMD radeonsi driver. Interestingly, the Intel Iris driver does not suffer from visual corruptions even with the p_next creation structures missing.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining issue at the moment is a crash happening with the Intel Iris driver, when flushing the signal semaphore command from the OpenGL side. Running a debug version of the driver, it prints out `Failed to submit batchbuffer: Invalid argument`. Given that the driver does not pass the piglit `vk-semaphores-2` test, this is probably a problem within the Iris driver. I will submit a bug report to the Mesa repository.\r\n\r\nI have created some [sample code](https://gist.github.com/fayalalebrun/8845ba4464af687895cf49ba96b105d6). This program draws to a shared texture with Glium from another thread, which is the drawn to the window by Vulkano. This texture oscillates between a black and green color. I'm interested to hear how well it works on Nvidia or with other Intel/AMD drivers.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- `Fix device memory builder not including p_next structures.`\r\n- `Fix exportable image not created with VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo.`\r\n- `Fix mutable bit not set on exportable image.`\r\n[\r\nRelated Glium MR](https://github.com/glium/glium/pull/1965)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1734/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1734/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1729", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1729/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1729/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1729/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1729", "id": 1030272146, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAk0cF84tYhV_", "number": 1729, "title": "Add `DescriptorRequirements`", "user": {"login": "Rua", "id": 3090610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA2MTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rua", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2021-10-19T12:53:54Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-03T08:53:56Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-25T17:16:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1729", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1729", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1729.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1729.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-25T17:16:54Z"}, "body": "Changelog:\r\n```markdown\r\n- **Breaking** Removed the `EntryPointAbstract` trait, which was unused.\r\n- **Breaking** `ComputeEntryPoint` and `GraphicsEntryPoint` now hold a list of `DescriptorRequirements` instead of `DescriptorSetDesc`.\r\n- **Breaking** Removed `union`, `union_multiple` and `ensure_compatible_with_shader` from `DescriptorSetDesc`, and `union` from `DescriptorDesc`.

A lot of new states and features are added here. I decided to change how state is provided to `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` because there was starting to be too much of it, making the number of methods unreadably large. Now, instead, the builder simply takes state objects, each of which has a pure Vulkan equivalent. These state objects have convenience builder methods where appropriate, and sensible defaults. Examples of how this looks are in the... well, examples.\r\n\r\nI added support for the `ext_extended_dynamic_state` and `ext_extended_dynamic_state2` extensions, which add \"dynamicness\" to a lot of existing pipeline state. In addition, I added three completely new pipeline states.\r\n\r\nI hope I didn't miss out on any important/breaking changes.

`Format` variants are now all uppercase with underscores. This avoids interpretation problems where the underscore is significant for the meaning.\r\n  - The `ty` method and the `FormatTy` enum are removed. They are replaced with the `NumericType` enum, which concerns itself only with the numeric representation and not with other properties. There are now three `type_*` methods to retrieve it, for colour, depth and stencil respectively.\r\n  - The `planes` method now returns a slice containing the equivalent single-plane formats of each plane.\r\n- **Breaking** The `ImageAccess` trait no longer has the `has_color`, `has_depth` and `has_stencil` methods. This information can be queried using the `aspects` or `type_*` methods of `Format`.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- Non-breaking `Format` additions:\r\n  - Formats and their metadata are now auto-generated from vk.xml. This significantly expands the support for YCbCr formats in particular.\r\n  - The `compatibility` method returns an object that can be used to check the compatibility of two formats, explained [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap43.html#formats-compatibility-classes).\r\n  - The `components` method returns the number of bits in each colour component.\r\n  - The `compression` method returns the compression scheme as a new enum, `CompressionType`.\r\n  - The `requires_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` method returns whether the \"sampler YCbCr conversion\" must be enabled on an image view and sampler in order to use this format.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a bunch of new formats that weren't supported yet, expands with new methods to query particular properties, and makes the existing methods more sane. I also wrote some better documentation for the `format` module. The ability to test for format compatibility allows #1666 to be solved, while all the other new methods fulfill other validity-testing use cases that are currently unimplemented. Sampler YCbCr conversion would certainly be worth a future PR.\r\n\r\nThe biggest, and perhaps most controversial breaking change is that the variants are now uppercase snake-cased like in C, rather than camelcased like is customary in Rust. But I found that this increases readability of the names a lot for complex formats. Take `G16_B16R16_2PLANE_420_UNORM` for example. In Rust camelcase, this would end up as `G16B16R162Plane420Unorm`, where the 16 and 2 are no longer separated, and no distinction is made between components in the same plane and components in different planes (G in one plane, B and R in the other). Similar problems occur with names like `G8B8G8R8_422_UNORM` and `PVRTC1_2BPP_UNORM_BLOCK`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1687/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1687/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1670", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1670/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1670/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1670/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1670", "id": 968342670, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzEwNDY1MDc3", "number": 1670, "title": "Generate full code directly in autogen instead of using macros", "user": {"login": "Rua", "id": 3090610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA2MTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rua", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-08-12T08:28:19Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-03T08:54:50Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-16T18:48:16Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1670", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1670", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1670.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1670.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-16T18:48:16Z"}, "body": "Changelog:\r\n```markdown\r\n- The full Rust code is now generated from vk.xml by autogen directly, instead of using intermediate macros.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implements what I proposed in #1654.
