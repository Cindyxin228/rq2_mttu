"merged_at": "2023-02-01T12:37:14Z"}, "body": "## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n### Update to Federation v2.3.0 ([Issue #2465](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2465), [Issue #2485](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2485) and [Issue #2489](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489))\n\nThis brings in Federation v2.3.0 execution support for:\n- `@interfaceObject` (added to federation in [federation#2277](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/2277)).\n- the bug fix from [federation#2294](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2294).\n\nBy [@abernix](https://github.com/abernix) and [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2462\nBy [@pcmanus](https://github.com/pcmanus) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2485 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489\n\n### Always deduplicate variables ([Issue #2387](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2387))\n\nVariable deduplication allows the router to reduce the number of entities that are requested from subgraphs if some of them are redundant, and as such reduce the size of subgraph responses. It has been available for a while but was not active by default. This is now always on.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2445\n\n### Add optional `Access-Control-Max-Age` header to CORS plugin ([Issue #2212](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2212))\n\nAdds new option called `max_age` to the existing `cors` object which will set the value returned in the [`Access-Control-Max-Age`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Max-Age) header. As was the case previously, when this value is not set **no** value is returned.\n\nIt can be enabled using our standard time notation, as follows:\n\n```\ncors:\n  max_age: 1day\n```\n\nBy [@osamra-rbi](https://github.com/osamra-rbi) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2331\n\n### Improved support for wildcards in `supergraph.path` configuration ([Issue #2406](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2406))\n\nYou can now use a wildcard in supergraph endpoint `path` like this:\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  listen: 0.0.0.0:4000\n  path: /graph*\n```\n\nIn this example, the Router would respond to requests on both `/graphql` and `/graphiql`.\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2410\n\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Fixes\n\n### Forbid caching `PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND` responses ([Issue #2502](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2502))\n\nThe router now sends a `cache-control: private, no-cache, must-revalidate` response header to clients, in addition to the existing `PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND` error code on the response which was being sent previously.  This expanded behaviour occurs when when a persisted query hash could not be found and is important since such responses should **not** be cached by intermediary proxies/CDNs since the client will need to be able to send the full query directly to the Router on a subsequent request.\n\nBy [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2503\n### Listen on root URL when `/*` is set in `supergraph.path` configuration ([Issue #2471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2471))\n\nThis resolves a regression which occurred in Router 1.8 when using wildcard notation on a path-boundary, as such:\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  path: /*\n```\n\nThis occurred due to an underlying [Axum upgrade](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/releases/tag/axum-v0.6.0) and resulted in failure to listen on `localhost` when a path was absent. We now special case `/*` to also listen to the URL without a path so you're able to call `http://localhost` (for example).\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2472\n\n### Return a proper timeout response ([Issue #2360](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2360) [Issue #2400](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/240))\n\nThere was a regression where timeouts resulted in a HTTP response of `500 Internal Server Error`. This is now fixed with a test to guarantee it, the status code is now `504 Gateway Timeout` (instead of the previous `408 Request Timeout` which, was also incorrect in that it blamed the client).\n\nThere is also a new metric emitted called `apollo_router_timeout` to track when timeouts are triggered.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2419\n\n### Fix panic in schema parse error reporting ([Issue #2269](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2269))\n\nIn order to support introspection, some definitions like `type __Field { \u2026 }` are implicitly added to schemas. This addition was done by string concatenation at the source level. In some cases like unclosed braces, a parse error could be reported at a position beyond the size of the original source. This would cause a panic because only the unconcatenated string is sent to the error reporting library `miette`.\n\nInstead, the Router now parses introspection types separately and \"concatenates\" the definitions at the AST level.\n\nBy [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2448\n\n### Always accept compressed subgraph responses  ([Issue #2415](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2415))\n\nPreviously, subgraph response decompression was only supported when subgraph request compression was _explicitly_ configured. This is now always active.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2450\n\n### Fix handling of root query operations not named `Query`\n\nIf you'd mapped your default `Query` type to something other than the default using `schema { query: OtherQuery }`, some parsing code in the Router would incorrectly return an error because it had previously assumed the default name of `Query`. The same case would have occurred if the root mutation type was not named `Mutation`.\n\nThis is now corrected and the Router understands the mapping.\n\nBy [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2459\n\n### Remove the `locations` field from subgraph errors ([Issue #2297](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2297))\n\nSubgraph errors can come with a `locations` field indicating which part of the query was causing issues, but it refers to the subgraph query generated by the query planner, and we have no way of translating it to locations in the client query. To avoid confusion, we've removed this field from the response until we can provide a more coherent way to map these errors back to the original operation.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2442\n\n### Emit metrics showing number of client connections ([issue #2384](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2384))\n\nNew metrics are available to track the client connections:\n\n- `apollo_router_session_count_total` indicates the number of currently connected clients\n- `apollo_router_session_count_active` indicates the number of in flight GraphQL requests from connected clients.\n\nThis also fixes the behaviour when we reach the maximum number of file descriptors: instead of going into a busy loop, the router will wait a bit before accepting a new connection.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2395\n\n### `--dev` will no longer modify configuration that it does not directly touch ([Issue #2404](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2404), [Issue #2481](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2481))\n\nPreviously, the Router's `--dev` mode was operating against the configuration object model. This meant that it would sometimes replace pieces of configuration where it should have merely modified it.  Now, `--dev` mode will _override_ the following properties in the YAML config, but it will leave any adjacent configuration as it was:\n\n```yaml\nhomepage:\n  enabled: false\ninclude_subgraph_errors:\n  all: true\nplugins:\n  experimental.expose_query_plan: true\nsandbox:\n  enabled: true\nsupergraph:\n  introspection: true\ntelemetry:\n  tracing:\n    experimental_response_trace_id:\n      enabled: true\n```\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Maintenance\n\n### Improve #[serde(default)] attribute on structs ([Issue #2424](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2424))\n\nIf all the fields of your `struct` have their default value then use the `#[serde(default)]` on the `struct` instead of on each field. If you have specific default values for a field, you'll have to create your own `impl Default` for the `struct`.\n\n#### Correct approach\n\n```rust\n#[serde(deny_unknown_fields, default)]\nstruct Export {\n    url: Url,\n    enabled: bool\n}\n\nimpl Default for Export {\n  fn default() -> Self {\n    Self {\n      url: default_url_fn(),\n      enabled: false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Discouraged approach\n\n```rust\n#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]\nstruct Export {\n    #[serde(default=\"default_url_fn\")\n    url: Url,\n    #[serde(default)]\n    enabled: bool\n}\n```\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2424\n\n## \ud83d\udcc3 Configuration\n\nConfiguration changes will be [automatically migrated on load](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview#upgrading-your-router-configuration). However, you should update your source configuration files as these will become breaking changes in a future major release.\n\n### `health-check` has been renamed to `health_check` ([Issue #2161](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2161))\n\nThe `health_check` option in the configuration has been renamed to use `snake_case` rather than `kebab-case` for consistency with the other properties in the configuration:\n\n```diff\n-health-check:\n+health_check:\n   enabled: true\n```\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2451 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2463\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\n### Disabling anonymous usage metrics ([Issue #2478](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2478))\n\nTo disable the anonymous usage metrics, you set `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in the environment.  The documentation previously said to use `1` as the value instead of `true`.

This is a first step towards replacing a bunch of code that grew organically during the Router's early days, with a general-purpose library with intentional design.  Internal data structures are unchanged for now.  Parsing behavior has been tested to be identical on a large corpus of schemas and queries.\n\nBy [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2466\n\n### Disregard value of `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` in Orbiter unit tests ([Issue #2487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2487))\n\nThe `orbiter::test::test_visit_args` tests were failing in the event that `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` was set, however this is now corrected.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2488\n\n## \ud83e\udd7c Experimental\n\n### JWT authentication ([Issue #912](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/912))\n\nAs a result of UX feedback, we are modifying the experimental JWT configuration. The `jwks_url` parameter is renamed to `jwks_urls` and now expects to receive an array of URLs, rather than a single URL.\n\nWe've updated the [JWT Authentication documentation](apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authn-jwt) accordingly, however here's a short sample configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nauthentication:\n  experimental:\n    jwt:\n

[#&#8203;7314](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/7314) [`f246ddb71`](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/f246ddb7142d978a927de743108b602c511be119) Thanks [@&#8203;trevor-scheer](https://togithub.com/trevor-scheer)! - Add an `__identity` property to `HeaderMap` class to disallow standard `Map`s (in TypeScript).\n\n    This ensures that typechecking occurs on fields which are declared to accept a\n    `HeaderMap` (notably, the `httpGraphQLRequest.headers` option to\n    `ApolloServer.executeHTTPGraphQLRequest` and the `http.headers` option to\n    `ApolloServer.executeOperation`). This might be a breaking change for\n    integration authors, but should be easily fixed by switching from `new\n    Map<string, string>()` to `new HeaderMap()`.\n\n-   [#&#8203;7326](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/7326) [`e25cb58ff`](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/e25cb58fffe54301fec562a72f845394c8ff4408) Thanks [@&#8203;trevor-scheer](https://togithub.com/trevor-scheer)! - Pin `node-abort-controller` version to avoid breaking change. Apollo Server users can enter a broken state if they update their package-lock.json due to a breaking change in a minor release of the mentioned package.\n\n    Ref: [https://github.com/southpolesteve/node-abort-controller/issues/39](https://togithub.com/southpolesteve/node-abort-controller/issues/39)\n\n-   Updated dependencies \\[[`e0f959a63`](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/e0f959a637c1bc4f07cc8c8dac3a078c7debc9ad)]:\n    -   [@&#8203;apollo/server-gateway-interface](https://togithub.com/apollo/server-gateway-interface)[@&#8203;1](https://togithub.com/1).1.0\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>clap-rs/clap</summary>\n\n### [`v4.1.4`](https://togithub.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;414---2023-01-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/clap-rs/clap/compare/v4.1.3...v4.1.4)\n\n##### Fixes\n\n-   *(help)* Respect `disable_colored_help` when using `arg_required_else_help`\n\n##### Performance\n\n-   Speed up compiling `arg!` macro\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udc7b **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

[GHSA-m4ch-rfv5-x5g3](https://togithub.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq)\n\nThe git2 and libgit2-sys crates are Rust wrappers around the [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) C library. It was discovered that libgit2 1.5.0 and below did not verify SSH host keys when establishing an SSH connection, exposing users of the library to Man-In-the-Middle attacks.\n\nThe libgit2 team assigned [CVE-2023-22742](https://togithub.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq) to this vulnerability. The following versions of the libgit2-sys Rust crate have been released:\n\n* libgit2-sys 0.14.2, updating the underlying libgit2 C library to version 1.5.1.\n* libgit2-sys 0.13.5, updating the underlying libgit2 C library to version 1.4.5.\n\nA new git2 crate version has also been released, 0.16.1. This version only bumps its libgit2-sys dependency to ensure no vulnerable libgit2-sys versions are used, but contains no code changes: if you update the libgit2-sys version there is no need to also update the git2 crate version.\n\n[You can learn more about this vulnerability in libgit2's advisory](https://togithub.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq)\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rust-lang/git2-rs</summary>\n\n### [`v0.16.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/compare/0.16.0...0.16.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/compare/0.16.0...0.16.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

The changelog is copied into this PR body for formatting preview purposes.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n### Add support for `base64::encode()` / `base64::decode()` in Rhai ([Issue #2025](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2025))\n\nTwo new functions, `base64::encode()` and `base64::decode()`, have been added to the capabilities available within Rhai scripts to Base64-encode or Base64-decode strings, respectively.\n\nBy [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394\n\n### Override the root TLS certificate list for subgraph requests ([Issue #1503](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1503))\n\nIn some cases, users need to use self-signed certificates or use a custom certificate authority (CA) when communicating with subgraphs.\n\nIt is now possible to consigure these certificate-related details using configuration for either specific subgraphs or all subgraphs, as follows:\n\n```yaml\ntls:\n  subgraph:\n    all:\n      certificate_authorities: \"\"\n    # Use a separate certificate for the `products` subgraph.\n    subgraphs:\n      products:\n        certificate_authorities: \"\"\n```\n\nThe file referenced in the `certificate_authorities` value is expected to be the combination of several PEM certificates, concatenated together into a single file (as is commonplace with Apache TLS configuration).\n\nThese certificates are only configurable via the Router's configuration since using `SSL_CERT_FILE` would also override certificates for sending telemetry and communicating with Apollo Uplink.\n\nWhile we do not currently support terminating TLS at the Router (from clients), the `tls` is located at the root of the configuration file to allow all TLS-related configuration to be semantically grouped together in the future.\n\nNote: If you are attempting to use a self-signed certificate, it must be generated with the proper file extension and with `basicConstraints` disabled.  For example, a `v3.ext` extension file:\n\n```\nsubjectKeyIdentifier   = hash\nauthorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always\n# this has to be disabled\n# basicConstraints       = CA:TRUE\nkeyUsage               = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign\nsubjectAltName         = DNS:local.apollo.dev\nissuerAltName          = issuer:copy\n```\n\nUsing this `v3.ext` file, the certificate can be generated with the appropriate certificate signing request (CSR) - in this example, `server.csr` - using the following `openssl` command:\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -extfile v3.ext\n```\n\nThis will produce the file as `server.crt` which can be passed as `certificate_authorities`.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2008\n\n### Measure the Router's processing time ([Issue #1949](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1949) [Issue #2057](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2057))\n\nThe Router now emits a metric called `apollo_router_processing_time` which measures the time spent executing the request **minus** the time spent waiting for an external requests (e.g., subgraph request/response or external plugin request/response).  This measurement accounts both for the time spent actually executing the request sa well as the time spent waiting for concurrent client requests to be executed.  The unit of measurement for the metric is in seconds, though this is not meant to indicate in any way that the Router is going to add actual seconds of overhead.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2371\n\n### Automated persisted queries support for subgraph requests ([PR #2284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2284))\n\nAutomatic persisted queries (APQ) (See useful context [in our Apollo Server docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)) can now be used for subgraph requests. It is disabled by default, and can be configured for all subgraphs or per subgraph:\n\n```yaml title=\"router.yaml\"\nsupergraph:\n  apq:\n    subgraph:\n      # override for all subgraphs\n      all:\n        enabled: false\n      # override per subgraph\n      subgraphs:\n        products:\n          enabled: true\n```\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2284 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2418\n\n### Allow the disabling of automated persisted queries ([PR #2386](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2386))\n\nAutomatic persisted queries (APQ) support is still enabled by default, but can now be disabled using configuration:\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  apq:\n    enabled: false\n```\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2386\n\n### Anonymous product usage analytics ([Issue #2124](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2124), [Issue #2397](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2397), [Issue #2412](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2412))\n\nFollowing up on https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1630, the Router transmits anonymous usage telemetry about configurable feature usage which helps guide Router product development.  No information is transmitted in our usage collection that includes any request-specific information.  Knowing what features and configuration our users are depending on allows us to evaluate opportunities to reduce complexity and remain diligent about the surface area of the Router over time.  The privacy of your and your user's data is of critical importance to the core Router team and we handle it with great care in accordance with our [privacy policy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/privacy/), which clearly states which data we collect and transmit and offers information on how to opt-out.\n\nBooleans and numeric values are included, however, any strings are represented as `<redacted>` to avoid leaking confidential or sensitive information.\n\nFor example:\n```json\n{\n   \"session_id\": \"fbe09da3-ebdb-4863-8086-feb97464b8d7\", // Randomly generated at Router startup.\n   \"version\": \"1.4.0\", // The version of the router\n   \"os\": \"linux\",\n   \"ci\": null, // If CI is detected then this will name the CI vendor\n   \"usage\": {\n     \"configuration.headers.all.request.propagate.named.<redacted>\": 3,\n     \"configuration.headers.all.request.propagate.default.<redacted>\": 1,\n     \"configuration.headers.all.request.len\": 3,\n     \"configuration.headers.subgraphs.<redacted>.request.propagate.named.<redacted>\": 2,\n     \"configuration.headers.subgraphs.<redacted>.request.len\": 2,\n     \"configuration.headers.subgraphs.len\": 1,\n     \"configuration.homepage.enabled.true\": 1,\n     \"args.config-path.redacted\": 1,\n     \"args.hot-reload.true\": 1,\n     //Many more keys. This is dynamic and will change over time.\n     //More...\n     //More...\n     //More...\n   }\n }\n```\n\nUsers can disable this mechanism by setting the environment variable `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in their environment.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2173, https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2398, https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2413\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Fixes\n\n### Don't send header names to Studio if `send_headers` is `none` ([Issue #2403](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2403))\n\nWe no longer transmit header **names** to Apollo Studio when `send_headers` is set to `none` (the default).  Previously, when `send_headers` was set to `none` (like in the following example) the header names were still transmitted with _empty_ header values.   No actual values were ever being sent unless `send_headers` was sent to a more permissive option like `forward_headers_only` or `forward_headers_except`.\n\n```yaml\ntelemetry:\n  apollo:\n    send_headers: none\n```\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2425\n\n\n### Response with `Content-type: application/json` when encountering incompatible `Content-type` or `Accept` request headers ([Issue #2334](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2334))\n\nWhen receiving requests with `content-type` and `accept` header mismatches (e.g., on multipart requests) the Router now utilizes a correct `content-type` header in its response.\n\nBy [@Meemaw](https://github.com/Meemaw) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2370\n\n### Fix `APOLLO_USAGE_REPORTING_INGRESS_URL` behavior when Router was run without a configuration file\n\nThe environment variable `APOLLO_USAGE_REPORTING_INGRESS_URL` (not usually necessary under typical operation) was **not** being applied correctly when the Router was run without a configuration file.\nIn addition, defaulting of environment variables now directly injects the variable rather than injecting via expansion expression.  This means that the use of `APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_ENV_PREFIX` (even less common) doesn't affect injected configuration defaults.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2432\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Maintenance\n\n### Remove unused factory traits ([Issue #2180](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2372))\n\nWe removed a factory trait that was only used in a single implementation, which removes the overall requirement that execution and subgraph building take place via that factory trait.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2372\n\n### Optimize header propagation plugin's regular expression matching ([PR #2392](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2392))\n\nWe've changed the header propagation plugins' behavior to reduce the chance of memory allocations occurring when applying regex-based header\u00a0propagation rules.\n\nBy [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2392\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\n### Creating custom metrics in plugins ([Issue #2294](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2294))\n\nTo create your custom metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) you can use the [`tracing` macros](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html#macros) to generate an event. If you observe a specific naming pattern for your event, you'll be able to generate your own custom metrics directly in Prometheus.\n\nTo publish a new metric, use tracing macros to generate an event that contains one of the following prefixes:\n\n`monotonic_counter.` _(non-negative numbers)_: Used when the metric will only ever increase.\n`counter.`: For when the metric may increase or decrease over time.\n`value.`: For discrete data points (i.e., when taking the sum of values does not make semantic sense)\n`histogram.`: For building histograms (takes `f64`)\n\nThis information is also available in [the Apollo Router documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/native#add-custom-metrics).\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2417\n\n## \ud83e\udd7c Experimental\n\n### JWT authentication ([Issue #912](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/912))\n\nExperimental JWT authentication is now configurable.  Here's a typical sample configuration fragment:\n\n```yaml\nauthentication:\n  experimental:\n    jwt:\n      jwks_url: https://dev-zzp5enui.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json\n```\n\nUntil the documentation is published, you can [read more about configuring it](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/dev/docs/source/configuration/authn-jwt.mdx) in our GitHub repository source.\n\nBy [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2348\n\n### Redis cache for APQ and query planning ([PR #2431](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2431))\n\nExperimental caching was [already available for APQ and query planning](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md#experimental--apq-and-query-planner-redis-caching-fixes-pr-2176) but required a custom router build with the `experimental_cache` Cargo feature. That feature is now removed to make that cache easier to test.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2431\n\n", "reactions": {"url":

full release before they can be tested by interested/affected parties.\r\n\r\nThanks to work done in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2202 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2323, we now have just enough automation in our release pipeline to take care of some of the necessary work for building these releases.\r\n\r\nWith some follow-up work, we can have these triggered through:\r\n\r\n- [Manual triggers] through CircleCI\r\n- [Scheduled pipeline] runs in CircleCI\r\n\r\n[Scheduled pipeline]: https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines/\r\n[Manual triggers]: https://circleci.com/docs/triggers-overview/#run-a-pipeline-from-the-circleci-web-app\r\n\r\nThis work touches on ideas from https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/229 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/242, though neither of those issues are _directly_ \"build nightly releases\", though I did suggest it in my comments on one of them.\r\n\r\nOverall, this creates Router versions of the format `v0.0.0-nightly+YYYYMMDD.COMMIT_HASH`, which look roughly like `router-v0.0.0-nightly+20220102.abcd1234-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` as binaries which we can attach to non-latest releases on GitHub Releases.\r\n\r\n### Overall Plan / Follow-ups\r\n\r\nI haven't executed this full plan yet, but the near-term follow-ups to this are:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make these nightly releases available as [pre-releases on GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)\r\n- [ ] Publish the Docker containers to [our GitHub Container Registry repo](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router)\r\n- [ ] Publish nightly builds as Cargo crates to [our apollo-router crate](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-router)\r\n\r\nThese are still up for discussions.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nComplete the checklist (and note appropriate exceptions) before a final PR is raised.\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes are compatible[^1]\r\n- [x] Documentation[^2] completed\r\n        The documentation is definitely not finished, but that's covered in https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2261\r\n- [x] Performance impact assessed and acceptable\r\n- Tests added and passing[^3]\r\n    - ~Unit Tests~\r\n    - ~Integration Tests~\r\n    - [x] Manual Tests\r\n\r\n**Exceptions**\r\nAs with most CI-based workflows, testing can be a bit challenging.  Overall, this can be tested locally by emulating the steps in the CircleCI file:\r\n\r\n1. Being in a clean Git tree state with the PR checked out.\r\n2. Running `cargo xtask release prepare nightly`\r\n3. `mkdir -p artifacts`\r\n4. `cargo xtask package --output artifacts/`\r\n\r\nThis will need to be documented as part of https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2261\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n[^1]. It may be appropriate to bring upcoming changes to the attention of other (impacted) groups. Please endeavour to do this before seeking PR approval. The mechanism for doing this will vary considerably, so use your judgement as to how and when to do this.\r\n[^2]. Configuration is an important part of many changes. Where applicable please try to document configuration examples.\r\n[^3]. Tick whichever testing boxes are applicable.
