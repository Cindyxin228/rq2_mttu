This gives us more regex functionality without the limitations that the `regex` crate imposes. The great thing about the `fancy-regex` crate is that if you don't use the \"fancy\" features, it just falls back to using the `regex` crate. The error reporting seems to be better with `fancy-regex` too. Instead of having two error variants, `fancy-regex` has 21. So, this should be a win-win.
