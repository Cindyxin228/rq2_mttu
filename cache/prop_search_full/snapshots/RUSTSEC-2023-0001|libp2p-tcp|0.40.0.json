Most crates depend on both of these. To compile the tests for this crate, we often need a concrete implementation to some of these interfaces. When specifying a workspace-inherited dependency, we don't get to choose to omit the `version` field next to the path. If a dependency is `path`-only however, it will be tripped by `cargo` during the release process which is why all of this worked before our move to workspace inheritance.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, we change the minimum amount of dependencies necessary back to `path` dependencies to allowing releasing of our crates.\r\n\r\nRelated: #4053.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease write a summary of your changes and why you made them.\r\nThis section will appear as the commit message after merging.\r\nPlease craft it accordingly.\r\nFor a quick primer on good commit mesages, check out this blog post: https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\r\n\r\nPlease include any relevant issues in here, for example:\r\n\r\nRelated https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/ABCD.\r\nFixes https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/XYZ.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nThe list of dependencies changed is only manually curated.

More specifically an application can\r\nwrite data via `AsyncWrite::poll_write` even though the remote has not yet confirmed the stream protocol.\r\n\r\nThis saves one round-trip.\r\n\r\n``` mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    A->>B: \"/multistream/1.0.0\"\r\n    A->>B: \"/perf/1.0.0\"\r\n    A->>B: <some-perf-protocol-data>\r\n    B->>A: \"/multistream/1.0.0\"\r\n    B->>A: \"/perf/1.0.0\"\r\n    B->>A: <some-perf-protocol-data>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen considering stream closing, i.e. `AsyncWrite::poll_close`, and using stream closing as an\r\noperation in ones protocol, e.g. using stream closing to signal the end of a request, this becomes tricky.\r\n\r\nThe behavior without this commit was as following:\r\n\r\n``` mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    A->>B: \"/multistream/1.0.0\"\r\n    A->>B: \"/perf/1.0.0\"\r\n    A->>B: <some-perf-protocol-data>\r\n    Note left of A: Call `AsyncWrite::poll_close` which first waits for the<br/>optimistic multistream-select negotiation to finish, before closing the stream,<br/> i.e. setting the FIN bit.\r\n    B->>A: \"/multistream/1.0.0\"\r\n    B->>A: \"/perf/1.0.0\"\r\n    Note right of B: Waiting for A to close the stream (i.e. set the `FIN` bit)<br/>before sending the response.\r\n    A->>B: FIN\r\n    B->>A: <some-perf-protocol-data>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above takes 2 round trips:\r\n\r\n1. Send the optimistic multistream-select protocol proposals as well as the initiator protocol\r\npayload and waits for the confirmation of the protocols.\r\n2. Close the stream, i.e. sends the `FIN` bit and waits for the responder protocol payload.\r\n\r\nThis commit proposes that the stream initiator should not wait for the multistream-select protocol\r\nconfirmation when closing the stream, but close the stream within the first round-trip.\r\n\r\n``` mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    A->>B: \"/multistream/1.0.0\"\r\n    A->>B: \"/perf/1.0.0\"\r\n    A->>B: <some-perf-protocol-data>\r\n    A->>B: FIN\r\n    B->>A: \"/multistream/1.0.0\"\r\n    B->>A: \"/perf/1.0.0\"\r\n    B->>A: <some-perf-protocol-data>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis takes 1 round-trip.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this commit is, that the stream initiator will no longer notice a negotiation error\r\nwhen closing the stream. They will only notice it when reading from the stream. E.g. say that B does\r\nnot support \"/perf/1.0.0\", A will only notice on `AsyncRead::poll_read`, not on\r\n`AsyncWrite::poll_close`. This is problematic for protocols where A only sends data, but never\r\nreceives data, i.e. never calls `AsyncRead::poll_read`. Though one can argue that such protocol is\r\nflawed in the first place. With a response-less protocol, as even if negotiation succceeds, A\r\ndoesn't know whether B received the protocol payload.\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nConfirmed against

Despite the unintended wrapping\narithmetic in release mode, it didn't cause any other logical bugs since the\nerrant code was for new analysis that wasn't used yet.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/995\">#995</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/995\">rust-lang/regex#995</a>):\nFix a bug where regex compilation with large counted repetitions could panic.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/a1a9ebe707fba85ff8e674ac6812a3aae14334f8\"><code>a1a9ebe</code></a> 1.8.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/710222d717ed09fc09cf2f350815bec4752373e3\"><code>710222d</code></a> changelog: 1.8.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/40d883d405ba3e992d84367a6e9ede4053125ab3\"><code>40d883d</code></a> bug: fix complete literal optimization issue</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/d555d6122d1d1a354c45361d029571413beca8ef\"><code>d555d61</code></a> fuzz: don't run on big haystacks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/8afffabb86caacb7ba8646530cf366e5921556e4\"><code>8afffab</code></a> fuzz: OSS-fuzz build scripts into this repo</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/6fb18108278e4a0b3f048ae9bf7aa3d712b16b4c\"><code>6fb1810</code></a> 1.8.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/709248c4f8d34264157d45db8c34bd008021de44\"><code>709248c</code></a> deps: bump regex-syntax to 0.7.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/4f664b9332cbd3dbd0cd2be14138f0cafb7c12ba\"><code>4f664b9</code></a> regex-syntax-0.7.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/40cbe1d24faffb2e5d4cf11540b3e484b2d9aa86\"><code>40cbe1d</code></a> changelog: 1.8.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/f9aec4179fb59c33d19b1fafd05ff9e2bf4dd735\"><code>f9aec41</code></a> syntax: fix overflow for big counted repetitions</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.8.1...1.8.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=regex&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=1.8.1&new-version=1.8.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nYou can trigger a rebase of this PR by commenting `@dependabot rebase`.\n\n[//]: # (dependabot-automerge-start)\n[//]: # (dependabot-automerge-end)\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>Dependabot commands and options</summary>\n<br />\n\nYou can trigger Dependabot actions by commenting on this PR:\n- `@dependabot rebase` will rebase this PR\n- `@dependabot recreate` will recreate this PR, overwriting any edits that have been made to it\n- `@dependabot merge` will merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n- `@dependabot squash and merge` will squash and merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n- `@dependabot cancel merge` will cancel a previously requested merge and block automerging\n- `@dependabot reopen` will reopen this PR if it is closed\n- `@dependabot close` will close this PR and stop Dependabot recreating it.

In that implementation the user (i.e. the WebTransport implementer) was responsible to check if the certhashes were valid, but I wasn't sure if I like it.\r\n\r\nWith the code of this PR, the user needs to only define certhashes in the `Config`, so I find it less error prone.

But it might be broken someday as well if we make a change on standard library on rustc. Writing simple wrapper in the libp2p tree would be the most stable solution for this project since you can have complete control over it and update it whenever standard library adds or changes something.~", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3973/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3973/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3972", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3972/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3972/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3972/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3972", "id": 1719336909, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBSHhDc5Q_6WM", "number": 3972, "title": "deps: bump data-encoding from 2.3.3 to 2.4.0", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2340311223, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQwMzExMjIz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "0366d6", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update a dependency file"}, {"id": 2527056927, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI3MDU2OTI3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/rust", "name": "rust", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update Rust code"}, {"id": 4755049708, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBSHhDc8AAAABG2xM7A", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/send-it", "name": "send-it", "color": "02FA53", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-05-22T09:58:12Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-22T18:10:11Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-22T18:10:10Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/3972", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3972", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3972.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3972.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-22T18:10:10Z"}, "body": "Bumps [data-encoding](https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding) from 2.3.3 to 2.4.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/ia0/data-encoding/commits/v2.4.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=data-encoding&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=2.3.3&new-version=2.4.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nYou can trigger a rebase of this PR by commenting `@dependabot rebase`.\n\n[//]: #

If successful, our listener will emit a new inbound connection. This connection needs to then be sent to the dialing task. We achieve this by storing a `HashMap` of hole punch attempts indexed by the remote's `SocketAddr`. A matching incoming connection is then sent via a oneshot channel to the dialing task which continues with upgrading the connection.\r\n\r\nRelated #2883.\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nPlease consider this a first draft. The design is largely similar to [go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/a4321de73f731f90925faf3df7150bfb4ab70e15/p2p/transport/quic/transport.go#L184-L269), except that I've only used the remote address as the hole punching attempt key. I have also added 2 examples analogous to the [TCP hole punch tutorial](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/tutorials/hole_punching/index.html) and am able to establish a direct connection upgrade. Questions/issues to consider:\r\n\r\n- `rust-libp2p`'s `Transport::dial`/`Transport::dial_as_listener` doesn't have peerid as an argument which [`go-libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/a4321de73f731f90925faf3df7150bfb4ab70e15/p2p/transport/quic/transport.go#L107) does. It could perhaps be extracted from the multiaddr or the trait could be changed to pass the peerid as well (not sure how involved this might be).\r\n- `Transport` trait doesn't receive the fully established `Connection` for us to be able to extract the peerid from the incoming connection. Without the peerid, we are assuming that an incoming connection from the ip:port for which holepunching was previously attempted is from the same peer.\r\n- Which listener should be used to send the random UDP packets? [go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/a4321de73f731f90925faf3df7150bfb4ab70e15/p2p/transport/quicreuse/reuse.go#L161-L227) uses the OS routing table, while for this PR, I've simply used the same code as `Transport::dial`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAny notes, remarks or open questions you have to make about the PR which don't need to go into the final commit message.\r\n-->\r\nApart from this, I think I also found an issue with the DCUtR `NetworkBehavior`'s implementation of `handle_established_[in|out]bound_connection`. Since `outgoing_direct_connection_attempts` is indexed by the *relayed* `ConnectionId`, shouldn't this method first try to get the relayed connection id corresponding to the possibly upgraded direct connection from `direct_to_relayed_connections`? If this *is* an issue, I could possibly create a separate PR for this.\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.

Unfortunately, we cannot use a pure Rust backend here because that one does not support configuring the window bits of the deflate algorithm which is used in the deflate websocket extension.\r\n\r\nUsing websockets in libp2p is already crazy inefficient because you end up with double encryption when using `/wss` (which is enforced by browsers if your website is served via https). A good encryption algorithm like noise or TLS produces an output that looks completely random. Any attempt in compressing this is pretty much wasted CPU power.\r\n\r\nThus, I think removing this configuration option does not really hurt and allows us to remove the dependency on the `zlib` shared library.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease write a summary of your changes and why you made them.\r\nThis section will appear as the commit message after merging.\r\nPlease craft it accordingly.\r\nFor a quick primer on good commit mesages, check out this blog post: https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\r\n\r\nPlease include any relevant issues in here, for example:\r\n\r\nRelated https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/ABCD.\r\nFixes https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/XYZ.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAny notes, remarks or open questions you have to make about the PR which don't need to go into the final commit message.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.
