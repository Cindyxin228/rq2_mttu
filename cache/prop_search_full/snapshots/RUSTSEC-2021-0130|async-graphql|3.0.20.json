email validator is not a very good implementation as can be seen by how many tests have been included in the code while being disabled.\r\n\r\nIt also lacks any checking of the length of the email which is something I think it should definitely have to prevent storing or processing large emails which could act as a DoS vector.\r\n\r\nAfter trying to write my own validator using Regex's like the current implementation I have come to the conclusion that `async-graphql` probably shouldn't be implementing something as complicated as email validation by itself as issues will always make it through.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue I have changed the email validator to use the package [`fast_chemail`](https://crates.io/crates/fast_chemail) to do this validation. This is the library that [`lettre`](https://crates.io/crates/lettre) uses internally so I think it is a solid library to use.\r\n\r\nI also ran all of the existing tests in the repository against this new implementation and the following tests acted differently:\r\n - The existing **enabled** test for `email@[123.123.123.123]` asserts it should be valid but when using `fast_chemail` it is invalid. This is due to the [HTML email validation specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address). **This test was enabled** so this would definitely count as a breaking change.\r\n - The existing **disabled** test for `email@111.222.333.44444` asserts it should be invalid but when using `fast_chemail` it is valid. This is due to the lack of IP validation in `fast_chemail`. This test however fails in the current implementation so shouldn't be of concern.\r\n - The existing **disabled** test for `email@example.web` asserts it should be invalid but when using `fast_chemail` it is valid. This is due to the lack of TLD validation in `fast_chemail`. This test however fails in the current implementation so shouldn't be of concern.\r\n - The existing **disabled** test for `\"email\"@example.com` asserts it should be valid but when using  `fast_chemail` it is invalid. This is due to the [HTML email validation specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address).\r\n\r\nIf adding the extra dependency is an issue maybe it is worth putting this validator behind a feature flag. I can do this if requested.\r\n\r\nI think adding this is important because as a consumer of the library I want to know that the emails are being validated properly.  I also think as a bonus having the email validation code use similar logic to `<input type=\"email\" />`  is better for web applications.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/758/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/758/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/773", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/773/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/773/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/issues/773/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/773", "id": 1091182272, "node_id": "PR_kwDODo0plc4wZs7l", "number": 773, "title": "Bump lru to 0.7.1", "user": {"login": "QuentinPerez", "id": 3081204, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwODEyMDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3081204?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez", "html_url": "https://github.com/QuentinPerez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/QuentinPerez/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-12-30T15:54:21Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-05T02:06:15Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-05T02:06:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/async-graphql/async-graphql/pulls/773", "html_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/773", "diff_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/773.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/773.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-05T02:06:15Z"}, "body": "\ud83d\udc4b A small PR to bump lru due to a RUSTSEC.\r\n\r\n`async-graphql` is not impacted but `cargo-audit` complains about the fact that we should update dependency which depends on it\r\n\r\n---\r\nUse after free in lru crate\r\n    = ID: RUSTSEC-2021-0130\r\n    = Advisory: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0130\r\n    = Lru crate has use after free vulnerability.\r\n\r\n      Lru crate has two functions for getting an iterator.
