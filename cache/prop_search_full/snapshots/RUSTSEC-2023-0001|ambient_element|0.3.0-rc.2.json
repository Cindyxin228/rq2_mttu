explosions\r\n- A top-down camera and a follow camera\r\n- A class system with three distinct classes (Assault, Scout, Tank)\r\n- A procedural level\r\n- A class selection UI\r\n- An improved \"holographic HUD\"\r\n- Health pickups\r\n- An aimable laser gun\r\n\r\nOh, and almost all of these are implemented as mods, so you can change them out at runtime.\r\n\r\nAlso features the following Ambient changes:\r\n- Macro now generates `assets` module at package level, not at scope level\r\n- Added a `fixed_rate_tick` method to make it easy to do an action every so often (used for input)\r\n- A bunch of semantic fixes\r\n- A bunch of preliminary work to make `Entity` a valid component value type; I tried going further, but WIT does not allow for recursive type definitions, so I had to give up. My plan was to use a serialized representation instead, but we have a lot of macro-driven code that makes special-casing things difficult, and fixing that would take too much time.\r\n- Exposed `remove_at_game_time` to the guest\r\n- Added `camera::get_active` as a helper method\r\n- Added a global `lerp` function\r\n- Fixed a few crashes\r\n- Added `--window-{x,y,width,height}` launch parameters to make it easy to launch two clients side-by-side\r\n- Improved `ambient new`:\r\n  - The start of #679 - new packages now have a 32-char ID generated. Still need to add the checksum. \r\n  - `--name` no longer appends to the path, making it usable as a configuration parameter\r\n  - `--in-workspace` can be passed in to avoid generating unnecessary files if you're already in a workspace (no Cargo config, no VSCode settings, etc)\r\n  - `--rust {none, empty, quad}` (defaults to quad) can now be used to choose the template used. None generates no Rust code (ideal for schemas), Empty generates empty main functions, while Quad generates the standard quad example we have so far. I foresee this being revamped in the short-to-mid-term future with different examples for different types of games.\r\n  - Altogether, this means you can make a mod for Tangent using `ambient new guest/rust/packages/games/tangent/mods/my_cool_mod --name \"Tangent Mod: My Cool Mod!\" --in-workspace --rust empty` and then replacing a few lines in the manifest to make it fully compatible. You don't have to delete files or lines of code any more.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AmbientRun/Ambient/issues/900/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,
