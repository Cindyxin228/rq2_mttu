If you were calling <code>finish()</code> explicitly, you will now need to use <code>let _ = foo.finish()</code> instead of just <code>foo.finish()</code> to avoid a warning about the unused value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When decoding input that has both an invalid length and an invalid symbol as the last byte, <code>InvalidByte</code> will be emitted instead of <code>InvalidLength</code> to make the problem more obvious.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.12.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>BinHex</code> alphabet</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.12.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>Bcrypt</code> alphabet</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.12.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>Read</code> implementation (<code>DecoderReader</code>) to let users transparently decoded data from a b64 input source</li>\n<li>IMAP's modified b64 alphabet</li>\n<li>Relaxed type restrictions to just <code>AsRef&lt;[ut8]&gt;</code> for main <code>encode*</code>/<code>decode*</code> functions</li>\n<li>A minor performance improvement in encoding</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.11.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum rust version 1.34.0</li>\n<li><code>no_std</code> is now supported via the two new features <code>alloc</code> and <code>std</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum rust version 1.27.2</li>\n<li>Fix bug in streaming encoding (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/pull/90\">#90</a>): if the underlying writer didn't write all the bytes given to it, the remaining bytes would not be retried later. See the docs on <code>EncoderWriter::write</code>.</li>\n<li>Make it configurable whether or not to return an error when decoding detects excess trailing bits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove line wrapping. Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library, and other features (streaming encoding, etc) either couldn't support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity. Line wrapping has been pulled out into a <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/line-wrap\">line-wrap</a> crate, so it's still available if you need it.\n<ul>\n<li><code>Base64Display</code> creation no longer uses a <code>Result</code> because it can't fail, which means its helper methods for common\nconfigs that <code>unwrap()</code> for you are no longer needed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add a streaming encoder <code>Write</code> impl to transparently base64 as you write.</li>\n<li>Remove the remaining <code>unsafe</code> code.</li>\n<li>Remove whitespace stripping to simplify <code>no_std</code> support. No out of the box configs use it, and it's trivial to do yourself if needed: <code>filter(|b| !b&quot; \\n\\t\\r\\x0b\\x0c&quot;.contains(b)</code>.</li>\n<li>Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.3</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update safemem</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.9.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Derive <code>Clone</code> for <code>DecodeError</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
