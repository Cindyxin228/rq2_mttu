All `virt_` funcs have no prefix, and for instance, `virt_read` becomes just `read`. This is because these functions also work on physical memory accesses, and other custom views.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are just 3 primary traits an user would interact most with: `Os`, `Process`, `MemoryView`.\r\n\r\nOptionally, there is `VirtualTranslate`, which is available only with DMA, and `PhysicalMemory`, which is the first thing available on DMA, but it is not meant to be used.\r\n\r\nDid not auto-impl `MemoryView` on `PhysicalMemory`, because of conflicting implementations with CGlue. Instead, there are 2 functions - `phys_view`, and `into_phys_view` to create a `MemoryView` out of a `PhysicalMemory` object. I think this is good, because that allows an OS to have a default virtual memory view, and then optionally provide a secondary physical memory view. I believe physical memory lies kinda not in OS' control so it makes sense. A thing to note is that `CGlue` helper is not being generated for these functions - an alternative way to acquire phys mem view needs to be provided, perhaps through the FFI-lib.\r\n\r\n`PhysicalMemory` was not removed, because it is the interface connectors implement. While it could be possible to fully merge the traits through associated types, I believe it is not worth it, because they have slight variations in them, and user experience might be a little confused.\r\n\r\n`MemoryView` can be extended with structures that allow to build additional views on top of each other. Think isolating a slice of emulator memory, perhaps even re-mapping pages, and then performing reads inside the emulated address space. I think this change is also necessary for sane nested introspection.\r\n\r\nFinally, there should be some efficiency improvements, because the core read/write data stream is an iterator, which would allow for streamed reads.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/67/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/67/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/48", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/48/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/48/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/48/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/memflow/memflow/pull/48", "id": 782626377, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTUyMTQ0MjAy", "number": 48, "title": "OS Layers", "user": {"login": "h33p", "id": 22240533, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQwNTMz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22240533?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p", "html_url": "https://github.com/h33p", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h33p/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-01-09T15:14:04Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-25T13:25:04Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-25T13:24:54Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/pulls/48", "html_url": "https://github.com/memflow/memflow/pull/48", "diff_url": "https://github.com/memflow/memflow/pull/48.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/memflow/memflow/pull/48.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-25T13:24:54Z"}, "body": "This PR implements OS traits and dynamically loadable OS libraries.\r\n\r\nThere have been many changes throughout. Most notably, removal of some old traits, addition of more general traits and structures, renames of functions to be more general, removal of old interfaces.\r\n\r\nBiggest breaking change: removal of `memflow-win32-ffi`. All previous functionality and more will be provided by `memflow-ffi`.\r\nAnother big change is removal of `memflow::process` module. It was replaced with a much simpler mechanism in the `memflow::os` module.\r\n\r\nIn memflow-win32, `Kernel`, `KernelBuilder`, and `KernelInfo` were renamed to `Win32Kernel`, `Win32KernelBuilder`, and `Win32KernelInfo`.\r\n\r\nAdded generic traits: `OSInner`, `OS`, `Process`.\r\n`OS` provides all functionality that a generic OS would provide: access to processes, as well as optional features like keyboard input, physical/kernel virtual memory access. It does not limit itself to be based on DMA, and a `Kernel` could in theory be implemented as an abstraction for native OS APIs. Applications are endless, and include: clean nested introspection.\r\n`OS` is a supertrait of `OSInner`. It is needed, because `OSInner` accepts lifetime `'a`, which can only be removed once GAT (Generic Associated Types) are available.\r\n`Process` abstracts away a single process. It provides: virtual memory access, module list, basic process information.\r\n\r\nProcesses and modules are now described in a simple C compatible way: `ProcessInfo`, and `ModuleInfo` structs. They have all generic information that would be applicable to any process.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/48/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":
