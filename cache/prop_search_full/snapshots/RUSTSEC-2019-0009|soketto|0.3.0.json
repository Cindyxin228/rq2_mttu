API. To do so the following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n1. `data::Data` hides its internal `BytesMut` and is usable only via its `AsRef`/`AsMut` impls.\r\n2. `data::Outgoing` has been removed. Instead of a single `Sender::send` method we support multiple, e.g. `send_text`, `send_ping` etc., each being generic over its parameter type (e.g. `impl AsRef<[u8]>`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, to allow buffer-reuse when running a sequence of extensions, a `Storage` type has been added which allows upgrading from a shared read-only byte slice to an owned buffer. This \r\nowned buffer is the only place where `BytesMut` is still part of the public API, albeit only relevant for extension writers.\r\n\r\nThe `Storage` type also helps with the conflict between the desire to directly send `&str`/`&[u8]` and the need to mutate the data (e.g. when masking it). I.e. `Sender::send_text` and `Sender::send_binary` (which accept immutable slices) need to mask a copy of the argument slice. Where this is too expensive, applications can use `Sender::send_binary_mut` which masks the data in-place.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- The `validate_utf8` setting has been removed. As `Data` only offers a byte slice view, applications need to perform the check anyway.\r\n- A flag `has_extensions` has been added as an optimisation. If false, `Sender` and `Receiver` never have to compete for the lock only to find the collection to be empty.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Applications which are not interested in processing PONGs can use `receive_data` which skips over non-data messages.\r\n\r\nOn the sending side we now use an `Outgoing` enum which is either `Data`, again composed of text or binary data, or a `Ping` or `Pong`. Applications which do not want to send PINGs and PONGs can use `send_data` which accepts only the `Data` enum.\r\n\r\nFor all those types several `From` and `Into` conversions are defined which should make their use convenient.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow applications to send PINGs and await matching PONGs, taking appropriate action if their expectations are not met as well as sending unsolicited PONGs as a form of heartbeat message.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/issues/9/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/issues/9/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/issues/8", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/issues/8/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/issues/8/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/issues/8/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/soketto/pull/8", "id": 524484718, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzQyMjUwOTI1", "number": 8, "title": "Split `Connection` into `Receiver` and `Sender`.", "user": {"login": "twittner", "id": 132165, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE2NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132165?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner", "html_url": "https://github.com/twittner", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2019-11-18T16:42:22Z", "updated_at": "2019-11-22T13:22:33Z", "closed_at": "2019-11-22T13:22:29Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/soketto/pulls/8", "html_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/soketto/pull/8", "diff_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/soketto/pull/8.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/soketto/pull/8.patch", "merged_at": "2019-11-22T13:22:29Z"}, "body": "A continuation of [86a4e8063bff6f08809febe76824126744240622](https://github.com/paritytech/soketto/compare/86a4e8063bff6f08809febe76824126744240622...twittner:reader-writer-split), i.e. the async/await based version just before reverting back to implementing `Sink` and `Stream`.
