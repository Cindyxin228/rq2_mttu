Currently it is getting harder to develop this codebase, especially for multiple platforms. Currently, I have encountered these problems:\r\n\r\n1. Cross-compilation is not possible because of a bug in the protobuf conan package.\r\n2. We use conan as a package manager,. After the release of conan 2.0, some dependencies stopped updating.\r\n3. Writing an HTTP API in C++ is ugly\r\n4. The codebase can be compiled only with GCC or VS, we can't use clion because of a lack of support C++20\r\n5. CI infrastructure with two docker images is too expensive\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nI've ntegrated Rust into CMake scripts and we can use rust code in C++ by using the `cxx.rs` library. My plan is to start migrating from base classes and re-write all the levels of the application step by step.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Other
