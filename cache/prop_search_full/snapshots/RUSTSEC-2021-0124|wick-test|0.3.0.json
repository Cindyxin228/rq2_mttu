This is not uncommon but is worth noting.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Codegen changed to make data structures consistent across operations and calls to imported components.\r\n- Removed the ancient native `stdlib` (`wick::` namespace). It was never documented, only used in tests, and most operations were superseded by `core::` or external components.\r\n- Refactored triggers out of the runtime to support upcoming component model triggers. An experimental component-model trigger has been added for `command`-type modules.\r\n- Added `unary_with_outputs` and `generic_raw` operation types to simplify common op definitions.", "reactions":

to operations in complex wick apps has gotten more difficult with provides/requires, root configuration, and resources. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds `wick invoke` support for application configurations. When you do `wick invoke your-app.wick <path::component::operation>`, `wick` will instantiate a runtime and all children scopes, but will not start any trigger logic. It will find the appropriate scope by name and execute the operation in isolation. The `deep reference` syntax is IDs separated with two colons. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ wick invoke app.wick parent1::parent2::component::operation [same invoke config]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR:\r\n- enables deep invocation support for `wick invoke` on components for consistency.\r\n- refactors inconsistent, legacy naming in wick-runtime.\r\n- changes the audit/lockdown component syntax from dot-delimited (`this.that`) to double-semi-colon-delimited (`this::that`) for consistency.\r\n- changes the `__root__` audit/lockdown node to `__local__` to align with local Entities.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/418/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/418/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/413", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/413/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/413/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/413/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/413", "id": 1860454372, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGSprDs5YcdGl", "number": 413, "title": "Added packet assertions to wick test cases", "user": {"login": "jsoverson", "id": 842798, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0Mjc5OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842798?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsoverson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-08-22T02:49:58Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T17:44:58Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-25T17:44:56Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/pulls/413", "html_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/413", "diff_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/413.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/413.patch", "merged_at": "2023-08-25T17:44:56Z"}, "body": "This PR adds the concept of assertions and operators to wick tests to improve the flexibility of test cases.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 initial operators, `LessThan`, `GreaterThan`, `Equals`, `Regex`, and `Contains` with `Contains` being the only one implemented right now.

The WASI module showcases them but they're not necessary to rely on or use.\r\n\r\nBreaking changes for component devs:\r\n- There was an inconsistency to the naming patterns in `wick-component-codegen`. Everything generated for operations was housed under individual `operation_name::*` modules in the generated code, *except* the operation trait itself which was named `[OperationName]Operation`. This PR moves the operation trait to `operation_name::Operation`. To recompile old components, the operation implementations need to be changed from `impl OperationNameOperation for Component` to `impl operation_name::Operation for Component`.\r\n- The `.error()` method on outputs now takes a `&str` instead of `impl AsRef<str>` due to becoming a trait methods vs generated code. Any call to .error that passed in a `String` or otherwise will need to be updated to pass a string slice instead (e.g. `outputs.output.error(an_error_string)` needs to be changed to `outputs.output.error(&an_error_string)`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/384/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/384/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/380", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/380/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/380/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/380/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/380", "id": 1814301228, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGSprDs5WBNCa", "number": 380, "title": "Improved port inference (+ added flow sequences)", "user": {"login": "jsoverson", "id": 842798, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0Mjc5OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842798?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsoverson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsoverson/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-07-20T15:42:08Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-20T18:11:18Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-20T18:11:16Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/pulls/380", "html_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/380", "diff_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/380.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/candlecorp/wick/pull/380.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-20T18:11:16Z"}, "body": "This PR improves `wick`'s ability to infer port names so they can be omitted more frequently.

The configuration can be retrieved without processing or validation with `.into_inner()` or a configuration can be initialized and validated with `.finish()`.\r\n    - `UninitializedConfiguration` has two methods (`.set_root_config()` and `.set_env()`) to update the context that a configuration has access to.\r\n- fixes `ctx.env` access in trigger components\r\n- adds tests for `wick new app --trigger *` and makes them work.\r\n    - adds more succinct serialization of `ComponentOperationExpression` configuration\r\n- adds `From<&str>` impl for `AssetReference`\r\n- adds `float`, `int`,
