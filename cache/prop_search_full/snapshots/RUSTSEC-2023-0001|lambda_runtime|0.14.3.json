Nonetheless, I did my best to sanity-check, ensure that formatting was consistent, etc.  I also resolved a few test failures resulting from having a struct with a catchall `serde(flatten)`-ed into another struct with a catchall.

My [tokio PR adding a biased; mode to join/try_join](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7307) landed. This allows us to skip the bookkeeping of keeping track of which branch of a `join`/`try_join!` statement was polled last, and always just poll in order.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor optimization for our graceful shutdown handler, since we always want to just poll our graceful shutdown future first before our non-op extension. So we can save a bit of memory on the stack by skipping storing a usize. It also very marginally could impact latency (by micros if not nanos, it's insignificant probably).\r\n\r\nAlso applying a similar optimization to the internal extension example where we have it the extension wait until after the main handler completes so that it can flush telemetry.\r\n\r\nThis involved explicitly setting `tokio` to `1.46`. This won't impact our MSRV as our MSRV is set to 1.81 but tokio is 1.70.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I

This mostly is the right choice, but it does run the risk of occasionally blocking the tokio runtime - ref: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/2653\r\n\r\nFor high throughput, performance sensitive lambdas that have async concurrency in their handlers, they might instead prefer to use a non-blocking writer on a dedicated logging thread.\r\n\r\nYou can do that today by initializing a totally custom tracing subscriber, but the default one has convenient integrations with some native Lambda ENVs, that I'd like to keep using. \r\n\r\nIdeally we would have an API to return the configured `fmt::SubscriberBuilder` rather than implicitly initializing it in our helper. But, the tracing types are [very unpleasant to work with](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/575) due to the JSON vs full formatting choice. We would need to introduce a layer of dynamic dispatch, custom traits, or something else like that, if we wanted to bake in the handling for the `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_FORMAT` ENV. We could also have a default subscriber builder that adds the JSON format at the end, but that felt very heavyweight for a simple 'default subscriber' helper API.\r\n\r\nI felt that adding a custom writer is an important enough knob that a new `init_default_subscriber_with_writer()` API was warranted. It is much simpler code.\r\n\r\nI don't think the semantic version of risk of surfacing the [fmt::MakeWriter](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/fmt/trait.MakeWriter.html) trait bound is significant - first of all, we already re-export all the tracing types, so presumably we would treat a major version tracing-subscriber bump as our own major version bump. Second, the `MakeWriter` trait is very simple and seems unlikely to change; it just expects a function that returns something that implements `std::io::Writer`.\r\n\r\nNote that we also now explicitly initialize `init_default_subscriber()` using STDOUT writer. This is the current default behavior of tracing subscriber, but it could presumably change across a major version bump. Probably better to pin it and make it a conscious choice on our own end to change it, if we later desire.\r\n\r\n### Documentation decisions\r\nI didn't explicitly document this in the README, since I think it would add confusion as it is not the right choice for most users. I do reference the API in the new `Graceful shutdown` README section, which I think is a useful breadcrumb for the sort of user that might need it.\r\n\r\nThe function docs do give a pretty good overview of what scenarios it might be appropriate for.\r\n\r\n## Turnkey 'graceful shutdown hook'\r\nPreviously I had a more extended graceful shutdown example that added manual non-op extension registry, signal handling, etc. @bnusunny pointed out that this could be very cheaply abstracted away by the library, and he was right!\r\n\r\nI went with a route that was pretty opinionated and on-rails, to reduce cognitive load of the API. Specifically:\r\n- I implicitly register a dummy non-op extension that is subscribed to no events\r\n- I implicitly construct the signal handling loop for SIGTERM and SIGINT, wrapping the user-provided hook\r\n- I implicitly spawn a task to drive the signal handling + extension future, rather than returning to to the caller to interact with\r\n- I panic on unrecoverable errors rather than returning a fallible `JoinHandle` or since the caller generally will be thinking of this as a background task\r\n\r\nNote that the dummy extension is very low cost, since the extension.nextEvent API will keep a connection but then hang indefinitely if no events come. So it won't frequently wake the task that contains it and the signal handling future. Generally waking will be from the signal handling. The cost is essentially the memory to keep the connection open (and also in my testing, the extension future was exiting on run() when no events were registered, though I wouldn't count on that behavior).\r\n\r\nNothing is stopping the caller from manually constructing a more sophisticated set of signal handling, avoiding registering a dummy extension if they already have another one, etc. \r\n\r\nI did reference these choices in the function docs. I also shared the panic conditions as well as a realistic usage example. I also added a small section in the README to help with discoverability.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think that this is the API that is proper for 95%+ of callers, and anyway we can expand on it if we need to. I assume at that point it probably is worth baking into the `Runtime` type since anyway that is where we add more granularity of behavior.\r\n\r\n### Dependency changes\r\n\r\nI added a new feature flag for this, `graceful-shutdown`, since it adds new dependencies:\r\n- `tokio`'s `signal` feature\r\n- `lambda-extension`\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting is that this is the first time we actually need the `tokio` `rt` feature (`tokio::signal::signal()` requires it, as does `task::spawn()`). That matters more for #984 , but I made this feature a default feature to make it easier to rip that out without breaking people if we ever remove the vestigial dependency on `rt/rt-multi-threaded` without feature flags (across a semver boundary).\r\n\r\nI didn't add a `lib.rs` passage documenting this new feature flag, but I did mention it in a new README section. I also added some `docs.rs` metatags to give us the nice `feature` indicator for both this as well as the tracing module re-export.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI didn't see any great existing unit tests or integration tests that can be run locally, to extend to cover this case. My doctest validates that it will compile, but not that it runs, since it would hang indefinitely waiting for events. It would be cool to set up some sort of build-time integ testing that uses `cargo lambda`, but that wasn't scope I had time for.\r\n\r\nI did throw in the graceful shutdown helper in our integration test that presumably runs against github actions - that at least will capture a fatal regression in our logic implicitly spinning up the non-op extension, etc, that would prevent the function from starting properly. Open to cutting a new integration test to run in CI that more specifically probes this, if folks feel it is necessary. Itust will be a bit awkward, since we'll need to have it sleep for a while to let the function spin down. Also either we will need sort of callback from the function to call against our github CI runner from inside the shutdown hook (aka expose a server in Github CI), or else poll eg CloudWatch Metrics or CloudWatch Logs to validate that the graceful shutdown logic fired.\r\n\r\n**Manual e2e testing**\r\n\r\nI did test a complete example manually both:\r\n- locally (with my `cargo-lambda watch` signal handling fix in place - [ref](https://github.com/cargo-lambda/cargo-lambda/pull/853) \r\n- after deploying to an AWS account\r\n\r\nBoth showed the expected behavior:\r\n- function runs and responds properly to handlers\r\n- graceful shutdown shows up in logs on runtime shutdown:\r\n\r\nFull AWS logs are at the end of this section.\r\n\r\nI previously had my test code checked in as a complete `examples/` folder code. But, it felt kind of ridiculous when literally the doc comment was sufficient to demonstrate the behavior. I'm glad to add it back in if we think it is useful. Another option would be to use that example to show a more 'custom' signal handling use case that doesn't use our helper, but I was concerned that that would confuse readers.\r\n\r\nAWS

of changes:*\r\n\r\nChange how we handle error types to be more ergonomic:\r\n\r\n- Replace Cow with String: Diagnostics are serialized into JSON as soon as the function returns, which means that their value is copied right away. The performance improvement of using Cow is minimal in this case, but it has some ergonomic implications because we have to handle their lifetimes. By removing the explicit lifetimes, people can return Diagnostic values with static lifetimes which was not possible before.\r\n\r\n- Add features to implement `From<T> for Diagnostic` for anyhow, eyre, and miette error types. This helps people that use those creates to transform their errors into `Diagnostic` without double boxing their errors.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd0f *By submitting this pull request*\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo +nightly fmt`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've ran `cargo clippy --fix`.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/907/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/907/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/904", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/904/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/904/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/904/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/904", "id": 2383599440, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs50DsyD", "number": 904, "title": "doc: Add an example for using the anyhow crate", "user": {"login": "taiki45", "id": 1460043, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjAwNDM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1460043?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45", "html_url": "https://github.com/taiki45", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taiki45/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-07-01T11:32:47Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-01T16:24:20Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-01T15:14:34Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/904", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/904", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/904.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/904.patch", "merged_at": "2024-07-01T15:14:34Z"}, "body": "\ud83d\udcec *Issue #, if available:*\r\n\r\nNot resolve but related with https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/901\r\n\r\n\u270d\ufe0f *Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nv0.12.0 has breaking changes for users who use external error types like `anyhow::Error`. This PR brings documentation that makes it easier for both existing and new users to write lambda functions with crates like anyhow.\r\n\r\nWhile I believe a fundamental solution to eliminate the need for conversion from external error types to common types should be addressed in #901, this PR aims to provide documentation support for existing users encountering changes in v0.12.0 and for new users of the library who might struggle with simply using `anyhow::Result`.

if available:* #747, #691\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:* This PR implements the layering RFC presented by @calavera in #747 with minor modifications to get the implementation running.\r\n\r\nNotes about the current implementation:\r\n\r\n- The public interface hardly changes: user handlers must now be `Send` and `'static` but that's it. Using the top-level `run` function should result in functionally (almost) equivalent code (except for some logging statements).\r\n- The now-public `Runtime` type adds a few internal layers upon initialization to (1) catch panics in user handlers, (2) transform user handler responses into Runtime API requests, and (3) send completion/error requests to the Runtime API. Users can add their own layers on top: the service input is a custom `LambdaInvocation` type which provides request-specific information along with the `Config` of the Lambda environment for convenience.\r\n- Some services could probably be implemented a little easier if one would accept that any services wrapped in the runtime implement `Clone`.\r\n\r\nI also added an example on how one could implement a custom layer to create OpenTelemetry spans and flush telemetry after each invocation, hence, this PR is also closely related to #691.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for originally outlining the implementation @calavera, that helped a lot!
