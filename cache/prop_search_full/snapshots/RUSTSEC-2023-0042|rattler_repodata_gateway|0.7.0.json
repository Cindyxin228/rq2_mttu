"2023-07-04T09:33:00Z"}, "body": "This PR is a follow-up to #227. It refactors the parsing of versions to use `nom` instead of the code that was ported from conda. \r\n\r\nUsing `nom` allows removing some obscure regexes and should make it easier to integrate the same parsing logic in other places like the MatchSpec and VersionSpec parsing logic which are up next for a refactor.\r\n\r\nThe parser is about 3x faster in the common case and 2x faster in more complex cases.\r\n\r\nWith the new parser, I was also able to extract more information from the string which makes it possible to reproduce the exact string representation it was created from (with some obscure exceptions). Because of that, I was able to remove the \"normalized\" string representation from the struct further reducing the size from 128 to 112 bytes. \r\n\r\nAs you review this PR you will notice that some version string representations have changed. This is because the string representation is now constructed from the version itself. However, some cases are very hard to reproduce, for instance, the number `06` is represented as `6` in our code. While reviewing, make sure you check these changes and decide if they make sense or not.\r\n\r\nThis code again makes use of some bit twiddling to achieve all this but I wrapped all this behavior into structs to make it simple to reason about (see `Segment` and `Flags`).\r\n\r\nThings that currently fail to parse but did previously parse correctly are: \r\n\r\n- [x] `1__` parsed as `1._`\r\n- [x] `1--` parsed as `1._`\r\n\r\nI will look into those!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/conda/rattler/issues/240/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
