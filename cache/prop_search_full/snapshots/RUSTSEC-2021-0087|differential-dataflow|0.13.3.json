This PR attempts to extract their differences into compact support traits they can implement, largely about how to read from and write into containers, while in the process of merging.\r\n\r\nThe PR is meant to be largely behavior preserving, with some light glitches here and there around the elegance with which one can manipulate the general objects. I'm 100% up for discussing those as part of review, and either shipping or prioritizing any fixes for them. Examples include: 1. dropping some containers in the act of merging (the final containers in a chain), 2. calling `unwrap()` far too often, rather than destructuring.\r\n\r\nNo hurry to merge, but did want to put this in place so we can start looking at it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the PR reads as fairly LOC positive, several hundred are a new `columnar.rs` example meant to exercise the non-privileged access to these traits and types. Also, the PR does not yet `git rm` the columnation merger which is now dead code, nor is it yet able to get the flat container merger to build (???) so it cannot be removed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/issues/553/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/issues/553/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/issues/542", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/issues/542/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/issues/542/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/issues/542/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/pull/542", "id": 2698446047, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAheICM6DVayb", "number": 542, "title": "Changes to track timely master", "user": {"login": "frankmcsherry", "id": 5741500, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDE1MDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5741500?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry", "html_url": "https://github.com/frankmcsherry", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frankmcsherry/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-11-27T12:55:57Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-23T23:01:05Z", "closed_at": "2024-12-06T17:10:06Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/pulls/542", "html_url": "https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/pull/542", "diff_url": "https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/pull/542.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/pull/542.patch", "merged_at": "2024-12-06T17:10:06Z"}, "body": "Timely has some breaking changes, and these are the fixes necessary to bring it back in line.
