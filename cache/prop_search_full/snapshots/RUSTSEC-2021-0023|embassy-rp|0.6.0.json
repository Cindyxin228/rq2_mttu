It also adds regression tests to verify these changes and prevent incorrect usage of these types with non-`Sync` data. Additionally, a new dependency (`trybuild`) is added for compile-time testing.\r\n\r\n### Stricter `Sync` Implementations:\r\n\r\n* [`embassy-sync/src/lazy_lock.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-cd31bb3d341607967bd756da8f3d44ab3106dc08d38c7b4ec235230b584c2723L34-R39): Updated the `Sync` implementation for `LazyLock` to require both `T` and

Embassy doesn't care whether your parts on tape & reel or tray, so distribution method is excluded.\r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf4f2b2-52a6-41f1-844d-97cbaec6d512)\r\n\r\nFun fact, there are 128 part numbers for MSPM0 parts.
