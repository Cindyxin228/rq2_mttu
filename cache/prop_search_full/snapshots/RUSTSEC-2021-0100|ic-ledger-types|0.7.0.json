change removes the \"timers\" feature from `ic-cdk` package and moves the code into a separate library, `ic-cdk-timers`.\r\n\r\nThere are a few benefits of this approach:\r\n\r\n  1. The code becomes a little cleaner and easier to maintain because there are no conditional compilation going on.\r\n\r\n  2. The clients can now mix canisters using the timers implementation with canisters that implement their own timers in the same workspace. This was not possible with the feature approach.\r\n\r\nPlease include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed. Please also include relevant motivation and context. \r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [x] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/368/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/368/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/367", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/367/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/367/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/367/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/367", "id": 1569237868, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD8DZi85JK7xO", "number": 367, "title": "feat(breaking): bump CDK to use candid 0.9-beta", "user": {"login": "chenyan-dfinity", "id": 48968912, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTY4OTEy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48968912?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity", "html_url": "https://github.com/chenyan-dfinity", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chenyan-dfinity/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-02-03T05:17:35Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-03T21:35:58Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-03T21:35:57Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/pulls/367", "html_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/367", "diff_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/367.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/367.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-03T21:35:57Z"}, "body": "* Disable import macro.

and StableReader APIs, while maintaining backwards compatibility, to add support for 64-bit std::io::Read/Write implementations as well as implementing the std::io::Seek implementation.\r\n\r\nThis greatly increases the utility of stable storage, allowing it to be used for more complex read/write patterns, as well as taking advantage of the greater capacity.\r\n\r\nFixes #333 and #334 \r\n\r\n#
