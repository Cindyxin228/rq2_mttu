work well with Tokio, which\r\n  precludes options like Refcell.\r\n\r\nBut locking a mutex is slow.  Speed it up a bit by taking mutable\r\nreferences in most functions that need to lock the mutex and using\r\nMutex::get_mut instead of Mutex::lock.  That guarantees exclusive access\r\nat compile-time.
