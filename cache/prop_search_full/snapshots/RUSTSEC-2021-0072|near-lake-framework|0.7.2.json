Lake Primitives.\r\n\r\nThe base branch is `0.8.0`, we're moving to the release.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Update Mar 31, '23\r\n\r\nAfter comments and discussions around this PR and around the naming convention I've introduced, I ended up doing a pretty big refactoring.\r\n\r\nLet me give some context. The main concerns raised around the renaming of `near_primitives::views::ActionView` to the `lake_primitives::receipts::Operation` and all the related parts. \r\nInitially, I thought it was a great decision since we had a structure like `Action` representing the `ReceiptEnumView::Action` from `near-primitives`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Action {\r\n    receipt_id: CryptoHash,\r\n    predecessor_id: AccountId,\r\n    receiver_id: AccountId,\r\n    signer_id: AccountId,\r\n    signer_public_key: PublicKey,\r\n    operations: Vec<Operation>,\r\n // ^^^^^^^^^^ this one\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it looked pretty decent until NEP-366 with DelegateAction came to town. \r\n\r\nQuick recap the DelegateAction is a new variant for `ActionView` that contains `actions` too, and those actions are a set of almost the same `ActionView` except for the `DelegateAction` itself.\r\n\r\nAnd here's where confusion raises. Renaming the variant to `DelegateOperation` looks like a really bad idea, I've tried to rename the underlying field `actions` to `operations` and all things went even worse.\r\n\r\nSo I got back to the old conversation with @frol where he suggested this high-level version of the framework and primitives to focus on the Actions and Events instead of the core low-level primitives as we used to do. Most developers should not even care about `Transactions` or `Receipts` or something else. They really should be focusing on Actions that happened on-chain and Events produced. It led me to describe the idea in Lake Enhancement Proposal 002 (LEP-002). *Yeah, I have started LEPs similarly to NEPs. Though it's internal now until I decide where to publish them more conveniently.*\r\n\r\nSo this PR is a result of huge refactoring motived by the NEP-366.", "reactions": {"url":

are in Europe, I find much better and stable results when I run the benchmark from a server in Europe:\r\n\r\n* 0.5.0 version reaches 210-220 bps\r\n* this PR reaches 300 bps (still dips to 100 bps
