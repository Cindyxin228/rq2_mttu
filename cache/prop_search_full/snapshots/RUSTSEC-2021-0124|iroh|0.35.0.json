[This line](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/f3c9af35542a7f2e00303090d1ca5273f86bc375/iroh-dns-server/src/store/signed_packets.rs#L148) is wrong: It should be `existing.timestamp()`, because that's the entry we want to remove, not the (not-yet-existing) entry for the timestamp of the *new* packet.\r\n* Improve type handling and debug formatting around expiry timestamps, to make logs better readable and be less error prone to bad type conversions\r\n* When an expiry entry is being processed, and the corresponding packet does not exist anymore, the expiry entry is deleted\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional, if there are any breaking changes document them, including how to migrate older code. -->\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nWe need tests around expiry. This should've been caught earlier. There's currently only a [single test](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/f3c9af35542a7f2e00303090d1ca5273f86bc375/iroh-dns-server/src/lib.rs#L190) around eviction, added in the PR that added eviction (#2997). But that test only tests that expiry works at all. There's no test currently that verifies if entries in the expiry table are removed when a packet is upserted, which is the test that would fail without this PR.\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n<!--

code that will both update deps like #3288 but also makes 0-RTT tests pass again. \r\n\r\nThey were failing due to a [change in `rustls`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/releases/tag/v%2F0.23.24):\r\n> Behavior change: Clients no longer offer resumption between different `ClientConfig`s that share a resumption store but do not share server certificate verification and client authentication credentials. If you share a resumption store between multiple `ClientConfig`s, please ensure their server certificate verification and client authentication credentials are also shared. Please read the new documentation on the `ClientConfig::resumption` item for details.\r\n>\r\n> Additionally, if you share a resumption store or ticketer between multiple `ServerConfig`s, please see the new documentation on `ServerConfig` about this.\r\n\r\nEssentially what they're doing is [checking that the certificate verifiers are `Arc::prt_eq` and depending on that allow or disallow 0-RTT](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/pull/2361/files#diff-9d58cb90e1df25604b88544aca7ea999ccd23bc5657384e196e77f407c0f4acfR256).\r\n\r\nWhen running the tests with rustls logging enabled, I confirmed that this is indeed what's happening:\r\n> [TRACE rustls::msgs::persist] resumption not allowed between different ServerCertVerifiers\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe fix isn't straight-forward.\r\nThe reason we're creating new `ServerVerifier`s every time is that we're passing in the expected remote node ID every time.\r\n\r\nThere used to be no other way of grabbing the other node's ID in the verifier, until, coincidentally #3146 landed, which changed the server name that's set when connecting from always being `localhost` to `<base32 NodeId>.iroh.invalid`.\r\n\r\nI'm now pulling in that value from the `ServerName` that's passed to the `ServerCertificateVerifier` in `verify_server_cert`.\r\nAs far as I understand that value *should* be a client-set value not a value we get over the network.\r\n\r\nThe downside of doing this is that we'll not be compatible with iroh versions that don't use the `<base32 NodeId>.iroh.invalid` server names.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere's an unrelated change in here that's changing `make_client_config` and `make_server_config` infallible, as was done in #3161, which will definitely also have merge conflicts with this PR.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- `Router::spawn` is now a plain function instead of an `async fn`\r\n- `Router::spawn` is now infallible, instead of returning `anyhow::Result<()>`\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n<!-- Remove any that are not relevant. -->\r\n- [x] Self-review.\r\n- [x] Documentation updates following the [style

This allowed us to use macros to track metrics from anywhere in the codebase. However, this also made it impossible to collect metrics *per endpoint*, which is what you want usually as soon as you have more than one endpoint in your app.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on n0-computer/iroh-metrics#15, n0-computer/iroh-metrics#22, and n0-computer/iroh-metrics#23. It removes the global metrics collection from all crates in the iroh repository. Instead, we now create and pass metrics collector structs to all places where we need to collect metrics.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables the `static_core` feature from iroh-metrics, which means the macros for superglobal metrics collection are not available anymore. This is good, because otherwise we could easily miss metrics not tracked onto the proper metrics collector.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates iroh-dns-server and iroh-relay to use manual metrics collection.\r\n\r\nWhile this means that we have to pass our metrics structs to more places, it also makes metrics collection more visible, and we can now also split the metrics structs further easily if we want to separate concerns more.\r\n\r\nThis PR should not change anything apart from metrics collection. Most places are straightforward conversions from the macros to methods on the metrics collectors. At a few places, logic was changed slightly to move metrics collection a layer up to save a few clones.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* All metrics structs (`iroh::metrics::{MagicsockMetrics, PortmapMetrics, NetReportMetrics}`) now implement `MetricsGroup` from the new version `0.34` of `iroh-metrics` and no longer implement traits from `iroh-metrics@0.32`. \r\n* Metrics are no longer registered onto the static superglobal `Core`. `iroh` does not use `static_core` feature of `iroh-metrics`. Metrics are now exposed from the subsystems that track them, see e.g. `Endpoint::metrics`. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods now take a `Metrics` argument. You can always pass `Default::default` if you don't want to unify metrics tracking with other sections.\r\n\r\n#### `iroh`\r\n\r\n* `iroh::metrics::{MagicsockMetrics, NetReportMetrics, PortmapMetrics}` all are now marked `non_exhaustive`, and implement `iroh_metrics::MetricsGroup` from `iroh-metrics@0.34`  and no longer implement `iroh_metrics::Metric` from `iroh-metrics@0.32`. They also no longer implement `Clone` (put them into an `Arc` for cloning instead).\r\n\r\n* `iroh::net_report::Client::new` now takes `iroh::net_report::metrics::Metrics` as forth argument\r\n\r\n#### `iroh-dns-server`\r\n*  `iroh_dns_server::server::Server::spawn` now takes `Metrics` as third argument\r\n*  `iroh_dns_server::ZoneStore::persistent` now takes  `Metrics` as third argument\r\n*  `iroh_dns_server::ZoneStore::in_memory` now takes  `Metrics` as third argument\r\n*  `iroh_dns_server::ZoneStore::new` now takes  `Metrics` as third argument\r\n* `iroh_dns_server::state::AppState` now has a public `metrics: Metrics` field\r\n*  `iroh_dns_server::dns::DnsHandler::new` now takes  `Metrics` as third argument\r\n* function `iroh_dns_server::metrics::init_metrics` is removed\r\n\r\n#### `iroh-relay`\r\n\r\n* `iroh_relay::metrics::{StunMetrics, Metrics}` all are now marked `non_exhaustive`, and implement `iroh_metrics::MetricsGroup` from `iroh-metrics@0.34`  and no longer implement `iroh_metrics::Metric` from `iroh-metrics@0.32`. They also no longer implement `Clone` (put them into an `Arc` for cloning instead).\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\n<!-- Any notes, remarks or open questions you have to make about the PR. -->\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n<!-- Remove any that are not relevant. -->\r\n- [x] Self-review.\r\n- [x] Documentation updates following the [style guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.html#appendix-a-full-conventions-text), if relevant.\r\n- [x] Tests if relevant.\r\n- [x] All breaking changes documented.\r\n  - [x] List all breaking changes in the above \"Breaking Changes\" section.\r\n  - [x] Open an issue or PR on any number0 repos that are affected by this breaking change.

breaking change to `iroh` since we are \"adding\" to the API, but we will no longer be publishing `iroh-net-report` to crates.io, and to use the content from `iroh-net-report` you would need to depend on `iroh` and import it using `iroh::net_report`.\r\n\r\nThis should only effect `iroh-doctor`\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nWould be nice to make this private, if we can adjust `iroh-doctor` accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor the next release, I'll make a branch that has the old `iroh-net-report`, adds the deprecation status to the readme/cargo.toml & publishes.\r\n\r\n## Change

is a rebase & some changes from the #3145 PR, so we don't disturb users who are trying out the iroh browser alpha.)\r\n\r\n- Adds a bunch of `#[cfg(not(wasm_browser))]` to anything related to socket networking (UDP sockets, DNS, etc.)\r\n- Implements a `WebRuntime` for quinn to use instead of `TokioRuntime` in browsers\r\n- Implements sleeping & timing utilities for `backoff` that work in browsers\r\n- Moves `node_info` out of the `dns` module, so we can disable `dns` as a whole, but keep `node_info` for discovery\r\n- Disables `MappedAddr::Ip` in browsers\r\n- Adjusts dependencies so we don't depend on unused/unsupported things in browsers\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- `iroh-relay`: The `iroh_relay::dns::node_info` module was moved to `iroh_relay::node_info`\r\n\r\n## Notes

I have two main ideas:\r\n- Group a bunch of structs in `magicsock.rs`, i.e. everything that depends on sockets.\r\n  However, to do this, I want to refactor the way we *sometimes* use `Arc<netwatch::UdpSocket>` and *sometimes* use `UdpConn`, which is just a newtype over said type.\r\n  Ideally we store `Arc<netwatch::UdpSocket>` everywhere, since it's more commonly used in APIs, e.g. in iroh-net-report, and only use `UdpConn`, when we need the udp sockets to implement `AsyncUdpSocket` from quinn.\r\n- Refactor the `node_info` module so there's fewer places that depend on `DnsResolver` in it.\r\n  There's a bunch of things in that module that IMO are needless indirections (we go from `hickory::TxtLookup` -> `node_info::TxtAttrs<IrohAttr>` -> `(NodeId, NodeData)` -> `NodeInfo`. And even then, `NodeInfo` is mostly isomorphic to `NodeAttr`).\r\n\r\nI think both these refactors are helpful, but don't necessarily make the diff easier to read? Not sure. I'd like to merge this & then work on these refactors next week.\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Self-review.\r\n- [x] Documentation updates following the [style guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.html#appendix-a-full-conventions-text), if relevant.\r\n- [x] Tests if relevant.\r\n- [x] All breaking changes documented.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3189/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 3, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3189/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3186", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3186/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3186/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3186/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3186", "id": 2853744869, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHAHBRM6LP3wh", "number": 3186, "title": "deps!: update pkarr to v3", "user": {"login": "Frando", "id": 43627, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjI3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43627?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando", "html_url": "https://github.com/Frando", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Frando/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 9, "created_at": "2025-02-14T13:34:44Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-30T11:12:45Z", "closed_at": "2025-04-30T11:02:52Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/pulls/3186", "html_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3186", "diff_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3186.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3186.patch", "merged_at": "2025-04-30T11:02:52Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nUpdates pkarr from v2 to v3.

"2025-02-07T09:48:53Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWe used to have more-or-less identical code in various places to set a static DNS resolver and add a few extension methods on the `hickory_resolver::TokioResolver`. This PR cleans this up and makes all of iroh use the same resolver, defined in a single place, as a newtype struct around the `TokioResolver` from `hickory_resolver`:\r\n\r\n* Adds a newtype struct `DnsResolver` around `hickory_resolver::TokioResolver` in `iroh_relay::dns`. It lives (for now) in `iroh_relay`, because this is a the bottom of our dependency chain: both `iroh` and `iroh-net-report` need to use it as well, and both depend on `iroh_relay`.\r\n* Adds most methods from the previous extension traits to the `DnsResolver` struct\r\n* Changes all imports to use this `DnsResolver` now instead of the previous type alias to TokioResolver\r\n* Removes all now-obsolete duplicate extension traits and type aliases and duplicated tests\r\n* Removes the global `static` DnsResolver that was accessible via `iroh::dns::default_resolver`.  This means that by default multiple endpoints in the same app would not share the DnsResolver. However, I'd say a) it is not too common to use multiple endpoints, and b) if you do and want to share the DnsResolver, you can still do so by creating the DnsResolver yourself and cloning it into the endpoint builder.\r\n* Cleans up and aligns the various methods on `DnsResolver`, and newtype the types from hickory so that this public iroh API does not depend on hickory types (apart from a `From<TokioResolver> for DnsResolver`, which is deferred to a follow-up to investigate)\r\n\r\n\r\n  The only place outside of tests and examples where a new `DnsResolver` is constructed is in endpoint builder if no custom DnsResolver is set. This means: As long as an app has a single endpoint only, there will only be one DnsResolver.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* `iroh::dns::resolver` and `iroh::dns::default_resolver` are removed. There is no static, global DNS resolver anymore. If you want to share a DNS resolver between endpoints, create the resolver yourself with `iroh::dns::DnsResolver::new` and clone it into the endpoint builders (in `EndpointBuilder::dns_resolver`). If you want to reuse the DNS resolver from an endpoint, you can access it with `Endpoint::dns_resolver` and clone it to wherever you need it.\r\n* `iroh::dns::DnsResolver` used to be a type alias and now is a reexport of `iroh_relay::dns::DnsResolver` struct\r\n* `iroh::dns::node_info` module is now a reexport of `iroh_relay::dns::node_info`\r\n  * `iroh::dns::node_info::{IrohAttr, TxtAttrs, node_id_from_hickory_name}` are no longer public. Use `iroh::dns::DnsResolver::lookup_node_by_id` or `iroh::dns::DnsResolver::lookup_node_by_domain_name` to lookup node info from DNS.\r\n  * `iroh::dns::node_info::{to_z32, from_z32}`are removed. Use the methods on `iroh::dns::node_info::NodeIdExt` trait instead.\r\n* `iroh::discovery::dns::{N0_DNS_NODE_ORIGIN_PROD, N0_DNS_NODE_ORIGIN_STAGING}` are now reexports of `iroh_relay::dns::{N0_DNS_NODE_ORIGIN_PROD, N0_DNS_NODE_ORIGIN_STAGING}`\r\n* `iroh::dns::ResolverExt` is removed. Use the methods on `iroh::dns::DnsResolver` instead.\r\n* The methods in `iroh::dns::DnsResolver` now take an `impl ToString` instead of `impl hickory_proto::rr::domain::IntoName` for their `host` argument\r\n\r\n* `iroh::test_utils::create_dns_resolver` is removed, use `iroh::dns::DnsResolver::new` instead\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\n<!-- Any notes, remarks or open questions you have to make about the PR. -->\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Self-review.\r\n- [x] Documentation updates following the [style guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.html#appendix-a-full-conventions-text), if relevant.\r\n- [x] All breaking changes documented.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3167/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3167/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3162", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3162/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3162/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3162/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3162", "id": 2827754790, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHAHBRM6J3M8P", "number": 3162, "title": "refactor!: remove iroh-test crate", "user": {"login": "dignifiedquire", "id": 790842, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDg0Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790842?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire", "html_url": "https://github.com/dignifiedquire", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dignifiedquire/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2025-02-03T14:56:43Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-17T10:37:04Z", "closed_at": "2025-02-03T16:19:12Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/pulls/3162", "html_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3162", "diff_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3162.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/3162.patch", "merged_at": "2025-02-03T16:19:12Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThese testutils we are using, actually can be replaced through either simpler code or other crates.

replaces all imports of `futures_lite`, `futures_util`, `futures_sink` and `futures_buffered` with re-exports from `n0_future`.\r\n- replaces all imports of `std::time` with `n0_future::time`\r\n- replaces all occurrences of `tokio::{spawn,task,time}` with `n0_future::{spawn,task,time}`\r\n- **does not affect tests**: we use a bunch of special things there, like `tokio::time::advance` that we don't have n0-future yet. It's also not strictly necessary for shipping e.g. browser stuff.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is\r\n- to get us closer to browser compatibility (I've verified that I've replaced enough of all task spawning, etc. such that mostly cfg-ing out and other unrelated changes remain browser support)\r\n- to make the diffs of the browser-support PRs easier to follow\r\n\r\nEssentially this is work extracted out of the browser PRs.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nI don't think there are any breaking changes from this.\r\nIt's possible that `JoinSet` or `JoinHandle` types leak from the interfaces somewhere, but they're identical to the old ones (just re-exports) outside of `wasm*-*-unknown` targets.\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\nI've tried setting up semgrep, but (1) IIUC, setting it up for CI requires that you have an account with them, only running locally is free and (2) I haven't found a way to ignore e.g. `std::time` imports when you're inside a `*::tests` module, which means we'd either need to convert all our tests to `n0-future` or ignore warnings and I think both of these options might suck.\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Self-review.\r\n- [x] All breaking changes documented.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n0-computer/iroh/issues/3156/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":
