project.\r\n\r\nI added the possibility to configure the context (currently vsync and multisampling).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nInstead of\r\n```rust\r\nlet window = Window::new(\"Triangle\", Some((1280, 720))).unwrap();`\r\n```\r\nYou use\r\n```rust\r\nlet settings = WindowSettings { vsync: true, multisamples: 4 }; //These are the defaults by the way, compatible with previous hardcoded values.\r\n// Or WindowSettings { multisamples: 4, ..Default::default() }; if only a subset of settings is needed\r\nlet window = Window::new_with_settings(\"Triangle\", Some((1280, 720)), settings).unwrap();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggestions\r\nMaybe you should start using `rustfmt` to format code, to keep a consistent style (especially when merging code from others) and allow to reformat code automatically. I tried to keep the existing style.\r\n\r\nAlso, continuous integration would be great, to check the code at least compiles on main platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and to wasm. It could also enforce te code style.
