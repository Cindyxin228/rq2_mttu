href=\"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/releases\">bzip2's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 0.5.0</h2>\n<p>The 0.5.0 release is the first release in ~2 years. It sets an msrv of 1.65.0 and pins the 2021 edition. If the msrv or edition are a problem for your project: just stick with the 0.4.4 release.</p>\n<p>The repository has moved from <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton\"><code>@\u200balexcrichton</code></a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation\"><code>@\u200btrifectatechfoundation</code></a>, which takes on its maintainership from this point forward.</p>\n<p>The main new feature of this release is the <code>libbz2-rs-sys</code> feature flag, which uses the pure rust <a href=\"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/libbzip2-rs\">https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/libbzip2-rs</a> implementation of bzip2. Being all rust, and using (by default) the rust allocator infrastructure, cross-compilation (e.g. to webassembly) should be much easier.</p>\n<p>Besides that, the documentation was modernized (we can cross-link now) and several bugs were fixed.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>update <code>partial_io</code> to version <code>0.5.4</code> by <a
