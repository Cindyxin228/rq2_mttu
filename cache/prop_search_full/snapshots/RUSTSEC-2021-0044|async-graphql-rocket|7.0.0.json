`async_graphql` supports only \"execution\" type directives (which can be specified on query fields) and provided function is called during query execution.\r\n\r\nThere is another type of directives supported by grapqhl spec - type system directives, which simply acts like type level decorators http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#TypeSystemDirectiveLocation\r\n\r\nAlthough those type of directives doesn't (and shouldn't) alter the behaviour of library itself, but its a powerful tool to communicate additional metadata to schema introspectors and with @composeDirective support, it can be used in various ways to communicate meta type info to supergraph routers etc.\r\n\r\nThe alternative way would be reuse already available @tag directives, limitation being that the value of tag is just a string which lacks further syntax check etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes new proc macro `TypeDirective` which is similar to currently implemented `Directive` and is also is applied to rust functions. The difference is that function is used to generate arguments for directive definition, and later can be called on graphql construct to generate actual directive \"invocation\". Example:\r\n```rust\r\n    #[TypeDirective(\r\n        location = \"fielddefinition\",\r\n        location = \"object\",\r\n    )]\r\n    fn testDirective(scope: String, input: u32, opt: Option<u64>) {}\r\n```\r\nwill result in following defintion on generated SDL schema:\r\n```\r\ndirective @testDirective(scope: String!, input: Int!, opt: Int) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT\r\n```\r\nand can be invoked on object or field level like this:\r\n```rust\r\n    struct Query;\r\n    ...\r\n    #[Object(\r\n        directive = testDirective::apply(\"object type\".to_string(), 3, None),\r\n    )]\r\n    impl Query {\r\n        #[graphql(\r\n        directive = testDirective::apply(\"object field\".to_string(), 4, None),\r\n        ]\r\n        async fn value(&self) -> &'static str {\r\n            \"abc\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nwhich will result in the following SDL fragment:\r\n```\r\ntype Query @testDirective(scope: \"object type\", input: 3) {\r\n\tvalue: String! @testDirective(scope: \"object field\", input: 4) @noArgsDirective\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis allows to a nice way to extend grapqhl schema with additional metadata information.\r\nAnother powerful feature which is defined by apollo federation v2.1 is @composeDirective, which essentially says that any directives which need to be preserved on supergraph composition need to be declared with @composeDirective.\r\nIn order to achieve that two additional things need to be done on TypeDirective level and on SDL export options:\r\n```rust\r\n// enable composeDirective support\r\nSDLExportOptions::new().federation().compose_directive();\r\n```\r\nand on TypeDirective additional property is requred:\r\n```rust\r\n    #[TypeDirective(\r\n        location = \"fielddefinition\",\r\n        location = \"object\",\r\n        composable = \"https://custom.spec.dev/extension/v1.0\"\r\n    )]\r\n    fn testDirective(scope: String, input: u32, opt: Option<u64>) {}\r\n```\r\ncomposable property needs to contain strict URL with at least two path segments (last is always semver style version like v1.0) or apollo federation supergraph checks will fail.\r\nThe addtions above will result in additional schema fragment, which basically exposes directive as composable and is preserved in supergraph construction:\r\n```\r\nextend schema @link(\r\n\turl: \"https://custom.spec.dev/extension/v1.0\"\r\n\timport: [\"@testDirective\"]\r\n)\r\n\t@composeDirective(name: \"@testDirective\")\r\n```\r\nDifferent type directives can contain different compose extension urls - they will be grouped accordingly.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nCurrently this PR supporst only OBJECT and FIELD_DEFINITION locations, to keep the scope a bit smaller, but support for other grapqhl constructs can be added easily in the future.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- which name is better TypeDirective or SchemaDirective for macro?\r\n- it is possible to call function directly instead of directive::apply(...) style but since we generate a struct under the hood which we register as directive in that case we need a separate name for struct itself i.e:\r\n```rust\r\n#[TypeDirective]\r\nfn something(...)\r\n```\r\nand invocation can be \r\n```rust\r\ndirective=something(...)\r\n```\r\nBut the struct can be named as `somethingDirective` and registered as `schema.type_directive(somethingDirective)`. For me this might feel a little bit more natural, but generates two objects instead of one (currently apply function is a method inside struct).", "reactions": {"url":

generator.\r\n\r\n**What has changed?**\r\n- The source generator now uses a templating solution (handlebars), which makes the generator more robust. We can directly pass the `GraphiQLSource` struct to generate the source, instead of doing a lot of 'manual' string based manipulations. This introduces a dependency, but I think it is worth it from a long-term maintenance perspective.\r\n- Changed `credentials` field to an enum. I think that is better than allowing arbitrary strings. **[breaking change]**\r\n- The `endpoint` and `subscription_endpoint` are now relative urls instead of absolute ones. This matches with how routes are defined in most web frameworks; `Route::new().at(\"/\", ...)` in poem for example. This way, we do not have to know the exact origin url when developing the application, increasing the 'seperation of concerns'. **[breaking change]**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also created a PR to update the
