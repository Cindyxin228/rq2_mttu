if available:*\r\nThis PR is meant to continue the work started here: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/466\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\n**Original description**:\r\n _Allows using any http_body::Body implementation in the response for lambda_http._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor context, the outstanding issue on the original PR stems from this comment: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/466#issuecomment-1121351819\r\n\r\nI picked up this PR and worked on it to the point where I believe that I had a viable testing approach. Ultimately I am blocked from performing the testing that has been requested in the original PR.\r\n\r\nHere's why\r\n\r\nIn order to configure `contentHandling` we have to put the integration in the `aws`  (ie. not `aws-proxy`) configuration.\r\n\r\nThe request is treated as a `LambdaRequest::WebSocket` by the lambda_http crate, why this is and why the rust code panics when operated in this way, I don't know.\r\n\r\nOn an `aws-proxy` configuration, binary formats are dealt with by encoding the body of the response as base64 and setting `isBase64Encoded: true` (documentation: [Working with binary media types for REST APIs - Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-payload-encodings.html))\r\n\r\nI managed to configure an API Gateway + Lambdas to be tested with CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT and it doesn't appear to work. What does work is setting the integration as `aws-proxy` but then it operates completely differently.\r\n\r\nIf we test through API gateway we only have two type requests, one where the function returns a `Body::Binary` and one where it returns a `Body::Text` (maybe a 3rd one for `Body::Empty`).\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a simpler verification where we rely on the current unit tests (I'm adding impl IntoResponse for binaries + tests) and pasting the Lambda console results (below) that I got while debugging.\r\n\r\nHappy to dig in further if I'm wrong and misunderstanding something.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's the console output for both a lambda that returns text and one that returns bytes\r\n\r\n#### Bytes\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\r\n  \"headers\": {},\r\n  \"multiValueHeaders\": {},\r\n  \"body\": \"YmluYXJ5IGRhdGE=\",\r\n  \"isBase64Encoded\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Text\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\r\n  \"headers\": {},\r\n  \"multiValueHeaders\": {},\r\n  \"body\": \"text data\",\r\n  \"isBase64Encoded\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, because I was most of the way there I want to share the commit I removed from this PR where I setup an API gateway (non-proxy) and the makefile changes where I would have added the verifications.

The work is not completed, and I wanted to share it with you all now that I have functional examples to get people's feedback on the direction I'm taking.\r\n\r\nThe first crate is `lambda-runtime-client`. I've extracted this crate from the current runtime. The idea with this is to be able to reuse clients for different APIs. This brings some guarantees about client behaviors, like having a User-Agent header by default.\r\n\r\nThe second crate is `lambda-extension`. This crate implements the [Lambda Extensions API,](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html#runtimes-lifecycle-invoke) which is the main point of this PR. I've included two examples in this new crate so I can get feedback about the API exposed to developers that want to create extensions in Rust.\r\n\r\n[Basic Example](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/376/files#diff-73785481e24e1f7e116854203cd21288b4f0d14ef8d958f0796f00518215583d)\r\n[Example that subscribes to specific events](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/376/files#diff-7109631d88180a061dcc1085576cbd38987753568c6d5657936873ec5d535935)\r\n\r\nThere are a few things missing to get this PR in a mergeable state, mostly documentation, but I'll appreciate your input sooner rather than later so I can make these changes better.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [x] I confirm that I've made a best effort attempt to update all relevant documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/376/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/376/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/358", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/358/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/358/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/358/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/358", "id": 1037994013, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCVfZHs4txUR6", "number": 358, "title": "build: BREAKING CHANGE: upgrade tracing-[error|subscriber]", "user": {"login": "seanpianka", "id": 15352684, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzUyNjg0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15352684?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka", "html_url": "https://github.com/seanpianka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/seanpianka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3848878988, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCVfZHs7laTuM", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/labels/0.5", "name": "0.5", "color": "0052cc", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-10-28T01:30:25Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-19T08:21:13Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-31T00:01:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pulls/358", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/358", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/358.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/pull/358.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-31T00:01:15Z"}, "body": "*Issue #, if available:* #357\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:* Upgrade tracing-error to 0.2, tracing-subscriber to 0.3.
