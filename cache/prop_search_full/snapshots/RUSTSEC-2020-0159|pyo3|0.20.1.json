If you have a strong preference for the feature to be called `pool` I can rename to that.\r\n\r\nIn PyO3 0.22 we can make this migration stricter by gating the GIL Refs API behind this feature, and emitting deprecation warnings even when this feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nFinally in 0.23 or 0.24 we remove this feature and the accompanying APIs.\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nI have also pushed an accompanying
