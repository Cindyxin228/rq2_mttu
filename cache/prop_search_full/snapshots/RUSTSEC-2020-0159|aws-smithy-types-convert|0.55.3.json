Context\r\nThis PR refactors the client protocol test generator machinery to use a client instead of calling `make_operation` directly, and then fixes the ad hoc tests for the orchestrator.\r\n\r\nThe ad hoc tests revealed that overriding the signing region/service via endpoint config was lost when porting SigV4 signing to the orchestrator, so this PR updates the SigV4 `HttpRequestSigner` implementation to restore this functionality. It is doing this in the signer directly rather than via an interceptor since it should only run this logic when SigV4 is the selected auth scheme.\r\n\r\nOther notable changes:\r\n- Adds `--no-fail-fast` arg to `cargoTest` targets so that all Rust tests run in CI rather than stopping on the first failure\r\n- Changes `EndpointResolver::resolve_and_apply_endpoint` to just `resolve_endpoint` so that the orchestrator can place the endpoint config into the request state, which is required for the signer to make use of it\r\n- Adds a `set_region` method to SDK service configs\r\n- Deletes the API Gateway model and integration test from the SDK smoke test since it is covered by the ad hoc tests\r\n- Adds a comment explaining where the API Gateway model comes from in the ad hoc tests\r\n- Adds a `smithy.runtime.mode` Gradle property to `aws:sdk` and `aws:sdk-adhoc-test` to trivially switch between middleware and orchestrator when testing/generating locally\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice._\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2708/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2708/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2705", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2705/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2705/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2705/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2705", "id": 1711019987, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj85QkBa5", "number": 2705, "title": "Port API Gateway customizations to the orchestrator", "user": {"login": "jdisanti", "id": 433028, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzAyOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/433028?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti", "html_url": "https://github.com/jdisanti", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdisanti/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-05-16T00:21:42Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-17T23:56:43Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-17T23:56:42Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/2705", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2705", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2705.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2705.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-17T23:56:42Z"}, "body": "## Motivation and Context\r\nThis PR ports the API Gateway `Accept` header customization into the orchestrator implementation.

using 0.3.0, because we require `impl fmt::Display for\r\nmime::FromStrError`, which was first introduced in 0.3.4.\r\n\r\nAs to why `minimal-versions` is now picking `mime` 0.3.0 with this patch, it's\r\nbecause in `lambda_http` 0.7.3, they had [`mime

Context\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a benchmark suite to the `aws-sdk-s3` test in `aws/sra-test` so that the performance of client middleware can be compared against the new orchestrator approach.\r\n\r\nThe comparison is not yet apples to apples since the orchestrator isn't complete enough to be comparable, but this is a benchmark that we can check regularly as they become more comparable.\r\n\r\nInitially, the performance was really bad (43x slower than middleware), but that turned out to be a trivial mistake in orchestrator implementation that was causing some configuration JSON to get reparsed for every request. Fixing that makes the orchestrator only about 1.5x slower, and there is another trivial optimization that can be made to bring that down more.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark can be run with the following:\r\n```bash\r\nsmithy-rs$ ./gradlew aws:sra-test:assemble\r\n$ cd aws/sra-test/integration-tests/aws-sdk-s3\r\n$ cargo bench\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice._\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2593/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2593/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2586", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2586/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2586/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2586/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2586", "id": 1672010501, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj85OhYZW", "number": 2586, "title": "Remove aws-smithy-runtime-test from 0.55.x", "user": {"login": "ysaito1001", "id": 15333866, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMzODY2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15333866?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001", "html_url": "https://github.com/ysaito1001", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ysaito1001/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-17T21:41:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-17T23:30:53Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-17T23:30:52Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/2586", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2586", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2586.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2586.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-17T23:30:52Z"}, "body": "## Motivation and Context\r\nThe `aws-smithy-runtime-test` crate has repeatedly caused an issue each time we released `aws-sdk-rust` from the `smithy-rs-release-0.55.x` branch.

In the orchestrator world, that work is handled by `DefaultEndpointResolver::resolve_and_apply_endpoint`.\r\n\r\nThe way endpoint parameters and an endpoint prefix are made available to `DefaultEndpointResolver::resolve_and_apply_endpoint` is done by interceptors because they _may_ require pieces of information only available in an operation input struct. The place that has access to both an operation input struct and a config bag happens to be an interceptor.\r\n\r\nThere are two interceptors `<Operation>EndpointParamsInterceptor` and  `<Operation>EndpointParamsFinalizerInterceptor` per operation. We pass around endpoint params _builder_ through interceptors to allow it to be configured with more information at a later point; An end point parameters builder is first initialized within the `ServiceRuntimePlugin` with the field values obtained from the service config, and is stored in a config bag. The finalizer interceptor \"seals\" the builder and creates the actual endpoint params before it is passed to `DefaultEndpointResolver::resolve_and_apply_endpoint`. These interceptors implement `read_before_execution` because they need to access an operation input before it gets serialized (otherwise, `context.input()` would return a `None`).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nReplaced `StaticUriEndpointResolver` with `DefaultEndpointResolver` in `sra_test` and verified the test continued passing.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The test currently fails in the `main` branch (it returns a `None` when extracting `SigV4OperationSigningConfig` from the config bag in `OverrideSigningTimeInterceptor`, hence `unwrap` fails), and by merging the `main` branch this PR no longer passes the test, but it does not add new failures either.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice._\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2577/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2577/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2576", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2576/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2576/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/issues/2576/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2576", "id": 1666574614, "node_id": "PR_kwDOElwhj85OPXBB", "number": 2576, "title": "[Python] Automatically generate stubs", "user": {"login": "crisidev", "id": 1781140, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODExNDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781140?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev", "html_url": "https://github.com/crisidev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crisidev/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4554438317, "node_id": "LA_kwDOElwhj88AAAABD3c2rQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/labels/python-server", "name": "python-server", "color": "FBCA04", "default": false, "description": "Python server SDK"}, {"id": 4932490120, "node_id": "LA_kwDOElwhj88AAAABJf_TiA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/labels/refactoring", "name": "refactoring", "color": "14C725", "default": false, "description": "Changes that do not affect our users, mostly focused on maintainability"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-04-13T14:45:48Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-05T18:20:23Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-17T16:44:26Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pulls/2576", "html_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2576", "diff_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2576.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs/pull/2576.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-17T16:44:26Z"}, "body": "## Motivation and Context\r\nWe want to automatically generate stubs in the codegen diff to ensure they can be reviewed and have a simple way to generate and include the stubs inside the Maturin wheel.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe Python example has been moved to the `examples` folder and refactored.
