Alternatively we make `mod instrumentation` a separate package and use it as a dev-dependency.~ I've moved the tracking-related utils to a separate package `soroban-bench-utils` to avoid the prod dependency.\r\n2. These tests are disabled by default. For two reasons (added a comment in the test file): \r\n    1. They need to be run with release profile.\r\n    2. They cannot be run with multiple threads due to the `gloabal_tracker` contention. \r\n3. ~Only supports os=\"linux\" and \"macos\", due to the cpu instruction counting library being only available there.~ The \"other\" os now has a stub `InstructionCounter` that returns 0 always.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/956/reactions", "total_count": 0,

The idea here is:\r\n\r\n1. We split object references as before in two types differentiated by their low bit, but now they're \"absolute\" and \"relative\". Relative references indirect through a context-local table that just holds absolute references.\r\n2. We only _really_ care about this issue when dealing with wasm contracts. Local-testing / native contracts have no isolation / complete system visibility anyways, there's no point really worrying about \"who can see what\".\r\n3. Therefore the wasm VM argument-marshalling path is a natural point to do the relative-to-absolute translation. We translate relative references to absolute on the way in to the host, and absolute to relative on the way out. Wasm never gets to see any absolute references. If they forge one, we refuse it on the way in.\r\n\r\n(There is a slight downside in the current implementation which is that if you return the same absolute reference multiple times we'll create new relative references on each return. If this is annoying we can use a hashtable or something instead of a vector. But the vector has both performance and conceptual simplicity on its side, and in any case the user _shouldn't_ care about specific object references, and I expect most contracts do not run long enough or return the same object references repeatedly enough for this to matter either way)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/947/reactions",

and it's just needless code bloat to do the 4-way-switch in the guest.\r\n\r\nI also added a bunch of convenience infallible const member functions on `[IU]{64,128,256}Small` types to allow constructing them directly from `[iu]32` to make it cheaper in contracts that want \"small bignum\" immediates like 0, +/- 1 or whatever.\r\n\r\nPR is still waiting on a change @dmkozh is working on

also includes a change expanding `StorageType` (the type at the env-interface layer) from 2 cases to 3 -- including `::Instance` -- deviating a bit from `ContractDataType` (the type that controls the storage layer). It includes a projection down to that lower layer type though.\r\n\r\nThis PR isn't 100% complete, it depends on some more changes incoming at the XDR level -- and it appears it's going to have to integrate a bunch of pending XDR changes from other work -- but I thought I'd post it for examination. I think it's not too bad a solution to the problem. We still get to use `StorageType` in `env.json` and we get a strong enum type on both sides of the interface.
