We could do one of the following [with these traits]:\r\n\r\n- Create a _single_ trait that is shared by `RequestBodyBuilder` and `ResponseBuilder` (instead of two separate traits). The trait could include common shared things, but _may_ result in people using `response` objects in requests or otherwise blending the two different types. (A single shared trait is originally how I did this in my own project.)\r\n- Drop the traits and implement these as methods directly on `RequestBodyBuilder` and `ResponseBuilder`.\r\n- Alternatively, I could keep the two new traits but also implement `RequestBodyBuilderExt` (probably renaming the trait) for `RequestBody` and `ResponseBuilderExt` for `Response` (also renaming the trait) instead of just for the builders and then having traits would probably be justified.\r\n\r\nHappy to implement one of the above or leave this as-is.
