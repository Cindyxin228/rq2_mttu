This implementation of CBOR for serde is used in hundreds of projects with widely differing needs. Besides the standard features it contains code for no-std environments, a packed encoding and CBOR tags.\nHowever while these features are useful to many people they sometimes interact poorly with each others and with optional features of serde itself. Because I don't use the crate myself and because of the potential for new errors I have been reluctant to accept any changes or additional features for the crate. Since this situation is unlikely to change anytime soon and no one else stepped up to maintain this crate I am archiving the repository today. If the crate works for you there is no need to switch to another implementation. However if you encounter problems or for new projects I recommend you take a look at these crates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/ciborium\">ciborium</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/minicbor\">minicbor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Update to serde 1.0.0</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/commit/347a3f096d5a1e8e380b9968e74838c9037a5b14\"><code>347a3f0</code></a> Final commit, archive project</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/commit/a218403a52e60c991313f429e4acc05cce81ce25\"><code>a218403</code></a> Fix rustfmt issues in CI jobs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyfisch/cbor/issues/192\">#192</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/commit/d012830653340b13d349d59838304d9c59a368ca\"><code>d012830</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyfisch/cbor/issues/176\">#176</a> from ctm/packed_clarification_and_minimization</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/commit/3d6d7a2de793e8808d016ad4deebf354ceedccb1\"><code>3d6d7a2</code></a> Clarify packed format and provide an example that also uses legacy_enums()</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/compare/v0.11.1...v0.11.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=serde_cbor&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.11.1&new-version=0.11.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
