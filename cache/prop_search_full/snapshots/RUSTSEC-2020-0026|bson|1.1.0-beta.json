errors\" and \"parse errors\" sections of the BSON corpus spec tests.\r\n\r\nAs part of implementing the parse tests, there ended up being far more changes (both in implementation and API) than I would have liked, but I believe they were all necessary. The changes stem from the fact that our current extJSON parser would not fail if extJSON wasn't formatted properly--it would just parse it as a document. The spec's indicate we should actually reject such inputs, which required adding failability to all the extJSON parsing mechanisms (`From<Value> for Bson => TryFrom<Value> for Bson`).\r\n\r\nTo implement these changes, I started by trying to modify `from_extended_document` to shake the boat as little as possible, but I quickly realized that doing the error checking there would require a ton of boilerplate. I instead opted to leverage `serde` as much as possible by defining models for the various extJSON representations of things, while still leaving `from_extended_document` around so as to not break the `serde` implementation.\r\n\r\nFrom an API perspective, I needed a new error type for extJSON parsing errors. To that end, I added an `extjson` and `extjson::de` module to house that type. In the future, I think we could add further generic functions for extJSON deserialization/serialization in there too.", "reactions": {"url":
