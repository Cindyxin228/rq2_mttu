However, this value can be changed\r\nin the config.\r\n\r\nTwo pieces of benchmark infrastructure are added - a simple\r\n\"benchmark mode\" on the server, and a \"stress test mode\" on the client.\r\nThese features can be used to help pick an optimal batch size for the\r\nserver.\r\n\r\nIn \"benchmark mode\", the server does not log any requests. Instead,\r\nit prints out the current request processing speed every second. This\r\nhelps to keep the output manageable when using the client's \"stress\r\ntest\" mode.\r\n\r\nIn \"stress test mode\", the client sends the same message to the server\r\nin a loop.
