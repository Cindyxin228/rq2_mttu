Its purpose is to make it possible to review the release notes, and changes to README.md.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/968\r\nFixes: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/552\r\n\r\n## Current release notes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ScyllaDB team is pleased to announce ScyllaDB Rust Driver 1.0.0,\r\nan asynchronous CQL driver for Rust, optimized for Scylla, but also compatible with Apache Cassandra!\r\n\r\nSome interesting statistics:\r\n\r\n- over 3.162k downloads on crates!\r\n- over 612 GitHub stars!\r\n\r\n## Stabilization\r\n\r\n1.0 has a special meaning for Rust crates - it means that the crate is considered \"API-stable\" - however there is no specific definition of what it means to be \"API-stable\".\r\nSo what does it mean to us, and why did we release this version?\r\nUp until now, we introduced breaking changes whenever we felt we could improve the API this way (sometimes we kept the old API for a bit, and provided a migration guide). This caused the vast majority of our releases to have to bump the major version number - we didn't reach minor version greater than \"2\" for a few years now. This is not a great situation for our users, because it means it is basically never possible to update the driver without adjusting their codebases.\r\nAt the same time we know that we can't (and don't want to) freeze the API forever - there are still many improvements we can make, and the databases (Scylla / Cassandra) are always changing, which sometimes requires breaking changes on our part (an example of this is Tablets feature in Scylla, which required us to change our load balancing APIs). This means we won't stay on 1.x forever.\r\nWe decided to stabilize the API by providing a guarantee regarding how long a breaking change won't occur, which will allows users to better allocate time for dealing with breakage. For the 1.0, we won't release 2.0 earlier than 9 months after 1.0 (but we may release it later). Until then we will release minor (1.x) versions. In 1.x versions we may of course introduce new APIs, and [deprecate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostics.html#the-deprecated-attribute) old ones, but there will be no breaking changes.\r\nTwo exceptions that may force us to release major versions quicker are:\r\n- urgent security issues\r\n- changes in Scylla / Cassandra that have to be supported by driver quickly and there is no way to implement them without a major version bump.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing new major version (e.g. 2.0) we will continue to provide bugfixes (but no new features) for the previous major version (e.g. 1.0). The exact duration of such bugfix support will be provided after the new major version is released.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, 1.0 release signifies that we view the driver as production ready. It has been for a long time now, but the 0.x version number may have been suggesting otherwise to some people, and we don't want to send mixed signals.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**New features / enhancements:**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Support for Rustls as a TLS provider was added. With this change you can connect to Scylla with TLS without having additional system C libraries installed! ([#1254](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1254))\r\n- Added Timestamp Generators. This is a user-customizable way of generating client-side timestamps for requests. ([#1128](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1128))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Driver metrics performance was improved. Previously they used `Mutex` internally, causing performance problems because of contention. Now `AtomicHistogram` is used to avoid this problem. Additionally, metrics are now guarded by `metrics` feature, so that the users who don't need them don't have to pay the performance cost and introduce additional dependency. ([#1263](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1263))\r\n- Borrowed versions of CqlVarint and CqlDecimal were added. ([#1148](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1148))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** In metadata, MissingUserDefinedType is no longer part of `CqlType::UserDefinedType`. Now, in case of this (and some other errors) the metadata fetch for given keyspace will be aborted (and warning printed), returning previous version of this keyspace if possible. ([#1162](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1162))\r\n- Metadata fetching now verifies that partition key and clustering key indexes have no holes. Thanks to that the users now have guarantee that column names from `Table::partition_key` and `Table::clustering_key` are present in `Table::columns`. If this is not the case, fetch is failed only for this keyspace, as above. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `Node::is_down` was made private, instead new method `Node::is_connected` was introduced. The old method has very misleading semantics. The new one tells if there are currently any driver connections opened to given node. ([#1196](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1196))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Added partial `Vector` support. Driver can now correctly fetch metadata of tables with vector columns. Serializing / deserializing vector values will be added after 1.0. ([#1020](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1020))\r\n- `Display` was implemented for `CqlValue`. ([#1257](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1257))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `rand` dependency was updated to 0.9.0. This is a breaking change, because a trait from `rand` appears in `ReplicaSet::choose_filtered` method. ([#1255](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1255))\r\n- Made all internal queries to `system.local` table use `WHERE key='local'` which should be a minor performance improvement. ([#1245](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1245))\r\n- Implemented `Debug` for `MaybeUnset`.  ([#1199](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1199))\r\n\r\n**Bug fixes:**\r\n\r\n- `Debug` implementation on `CachingSession` was not usable due to unsatisfiable bounds. ([#1161](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1161))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Our derive macros were not fully hygienic. This was discovered when migrating the hygiene test to new ser/deser frameworks. Issue was fixed, test was migrated and extended to cover more scenarios. Fixing hygiene required moving some modules in `scylla-cql`, so the change is breaking - but it should not affect users. ([#1176](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1176))\r\n\r\n**API cleanups / better types:**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Most of the driver module structure was reworked. Before most of the files were put in the non-descriptive \"transport\" module. Now our top-level modules are much more clear: `authentication`, `client`, `cluster`, `network`, `observability`, `policies`, `response`, `routing`, `statement`, `utils`. Some structs and method were also renamed as part of this effort. Unfortunately, this is a big change that will require users of our driver to update most of their `use` statements. ([#1163](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1163), [#1187](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1187))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `CqlType` was removed, and `ColumnType` is used in its place. To make this possible, `ColumnType` was heavily modified. ([#1166](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1166))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Errors refactor, started a few versions ago, was finished. Credits to @muzarski for this incredible work. ([#1204](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1204), [#1200](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1200), [#1191](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1191), [#1194](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1194), [#1193](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1193), [#1201](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1201), [#1192](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1192), [#1185](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1185), [#1180](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1180), [#1170](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1170), [#1181](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1181), [#1160](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1160), [#1159](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1159), [#1157](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1157), [#1168](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1168))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Old serialization and deserialization frameworks were fully removed, after being deprecated in previous version of the driver. ([#1184](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1184))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** After legacy APIs were removed it became clear that module structure of `scylla-cql` has a lot of problems. Many of them were addressed, which of course is a very breaking change. ([#1198](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1198))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** APIs related to TLS were refactored when adding support for Rustls. This will enable us to add further providers in the future without breaking backwards compatibility. ([#1254](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1254))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `Query` was renamed to `Statement`.  ([#1250](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1250))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Removed `SerializedValues` from public API of `scylla` crate. Functions using it were either changed to using `&dyn SerializeRow` or deemed unnecessary and removed from the public API.  Error types of `ClusterState` token calculation APIs were changed as part of this. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n- `ColumnSpecView` and `TableSpecView` were removed. `ColumnSpecs` received a second lifetime. `PreparedStatement::get_variable_col_specs` and `PreparedStatement::get_result_set_col_specs` now return `ColumnSpecs` to make it consistent with `QueryRowsResult` and `QueryPager`. ([#1249](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1249))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Low-level partition APIs were made private. `PreparedStatement::get_partitioner_name()` was made `pub`. ([#1222](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1222))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Marked various structures and enums `#[non_exhaustive]` because we may want to add new variants to them in the future. ([#1261](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1261), [#1262](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1262), [#1257](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1257), [#1205](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1205), [#1269](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1269))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `RetryPolicy`-related APIs were adjusted to past naming changes in load balancing. ([#1202](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1202))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Derive macro paths were made consistent, so that there is a single place to import a macro from. ([#1260](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1260))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `ClusterState` now has getter and iterator for keyspaces, instead of exposing `HashMap<String, Keyspace>`. ([#1266](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1266))\r\nThe two changes below are formally API-breaking, but are extremely unlikely to cause any breakage, so we don't mark them as such.\r\n- Unpublished `PeerEndpoint`, because it was not used in any public API. ([#1261](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1261))\r\n- Removed `RowSerializationContext::column_by_name` because there is no probable use case that needs it. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n\r\n**Internal API cleanups/refactors:**\r\n\r\n- Internal Session APIs were renamed to make them easier to understand. ([#1156](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1156))\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n\r\n- Updated documentation theme to 1.8.5. ([#1175](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1175), [#1174](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1174))\r\n- Documentation terminology was adjusted with regards to using `query` vs `statement` vs `request`. ([#1250](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1250))\r\n- Hidden internal testing API from publicly rendered documentation. ([#1262](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1262))\r\n- Our logo was not showing up on crates.io due to issues with relative links. ([#1158](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1158))\r\n- README and other markdown files were updated in preparation for 1.0 release. ([#1259](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1259))\r\n- Doc comments of our derive macros were moved to `scylla-macros` crate. ([#1260](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1260))\r\n\r\n\r\n**CI / developer tool improvements:**\r\n\r\n- Tests now retry DDL requests when Scylla returns \"group 0 concurrent modification error\" to workaround a problem in Scylla. ([#1197](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1197), [#1206](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1206))\r\n- Addressed Clippy lints enabled in Rust 1.85. ([#1256](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1256))\r\n- Various CI fixes, mostly Docker-related. ([#1195](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1195), [#1179](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1179), [#1173](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1173), [#1209](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1209), [#1259](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1259))\r\n\r\n**Others:**\r\n\r\n- Various small performance optimizations, mostly related to allocations in logging.

cases the function can be just removed, in others it can be made pub(crate), or the doc(hidden) can be just removed.\r\nFirst four commits should be quite obvious, I don't expect them to be controversial.\r\n\r\nThe last commit is the one I'm not sure about.\r\n\r\nIt removes `doc(hidden)` from items that are to be used only by our proc macros.\r\nWhy? There are a few arguments for that - but also arguments against that.\r\n\r\nA more theoretical / ideological issue is that the macros should be just that - macros, a way to automatically generate some code instead of writing it by hand.\r\nIf the macros use some private API that the user should not use, then this is no longer true - because writing the same code by hand is no longer possible without opting out of semver.\r\n\r\nOne exception that could be doc(hidden) without breaking this rule is items that themselves only use the public API, so they could be considered macro-internal items (e.g. macro could generate their code directly).\r\nMacros of course can't export non-macro functions, so the function would need to be generated as a nested function, which would increase compile time. `doc(hidden)` seems like a good solution here.\r\nExample of such item is `mk_typck_err`.\r\n\r\nThe more practical argument is that the items used by scylla-macros have to (currently, but not inherently) partially adhere to semver even if they are `doc(hidden)`.\r\nIf they are doc(hidden) then this is harder, because `cargo-semver-checks` no longer checks them (because they are not part of public API).\r\n\r\nWhy do those items need to (partially) adhere to semver in our case?\r\n`scylla` crate currently depends on `scylla-macros` in a way we would on most other dependencies: by specifying minimum version, and declaring that versions that are semver-compatible with this one are also ok.\r\n`scylla-macros = { version = \"0.7.0\", path = \"../scylla-macros\" }` means that using `0.7.0` is fine, but so is using `0.7.39`.\r\nLet's say we have `scylla` crate 1.1, with dependency on scylla-macros version = \"1.1\".\r\nNow let's say in 1.2 we want to change the API used by macros, so we remove some stuff from `macro_internal` mod, and adjust the macros.\r\n\r\nThis would break `scylla` 1.1 because it would happily use new version of the `scylla-macros` crate, that uses incompatible items.\r\nWe can fix it by treating our proc macro API as a public one. This would address both the theoretical and practical issue.\r\n\r\nThe solution that seem to be easier in practice is to only depend on a specific version of `scylla-macros`. \r\nThat is what `clap` and `serde` do - they depend on a specific version of their macro crates.\r\nIn our case this solution is not totally obvious, because `scylla-cql` is the one that depends on `scylla-macros`, and defines the items in `macro_internal` module.\r\nIf we wanted to go this way, we should probably:\r\n- make `scylla-cql` depend on fixed version on `scylla-macros`.\r\n- keep `scylla` dependencies loose as they are now, because `scylla` crates doesn't really influence macros.\r\n\r\nThe second solution allows us to modify the interface between macros and the code.\r\nIt's worth mentioning that macros are only a separate crate out of necessity (Rust doesn't allow proc macros to be defined inside lib crate),\r\nso depending on a specific version of macros makes sense - it's basically treating both crates as one.\r\nUnfortunately this solution doesn't address the first problem at all - the interface between macros and the crate still remains inaccessible magic :(\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-review

`CqlValue` without introducing API breaking changes in the future.\r\n\r\n## Obstacles\r\nWhen you simply try to add `non_exhaustive` to `CqlValue`, the compiler starts to complain. The reason is that `CqlValue` is defined in `scylla-cql` crate, and we match against its instance in `CqlValueDisplayer` (scylla crate). The compiler complains that `_` arm is not covered - which makes sense.\r\n\r\nWe could obviously add the `_` arm, but it's not ok. In the future, if someone adds new variant to `CqlValue`, the compliler won't complain about uncovered variant in `CqlValueDisplayer`. It will result in runtime error (or panic) when someone tries to display a CqlValue instance holding a new variant. So, TLDR, all commits but last are related to cleaning up, and moving `pretty` module from `scylla` to `scylla-cql`.\r\n\r\n## Things to discuss\r\n### chrono 0.4 - Very important!!!\r\nIn current version of PR, chrono 0.4 dependency is no longer **optional** (and hidden behind `chrono-04` feature). It's needed unconditionally for some conversions used in `std::fmt::Display` implementation for `CqlValue`. I'm not sure how to address it. I don't see (or know of) any alternative solution to this...\r\n\r\n## Pre-review checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Make sure you took care of the issues on the list.\r\n    Put 'x' into those boxes which apply.\r\n    You can also create the PR now and click on all relevant checkboxes.\r\n    See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have split my patch into logically separate

/ `&dyn SerializeRow`.\r\nThis is a leftover from the old serialization API, and should be changed. Why? Because there is no easy way for the user to create the SerializedValues.\r\nThat means that if a user wants to calculate the token / replicas, for some partition key of some table they need to:\r\n- Get the `Table` struct from `ClusterState`\r\n- Create new SerializedValues\r\n- Iterate over `partition_key` field and retrieve relevant `ColumnSpec`s from `columns` field.\r\n- For each column, call `add_value` on the SerializedValues and handle the error\r\n- Pass the result to `compute_token` / `get_endpoints`\r\n\r\nThis is a lot of unnecessary work.\r\nThis PR changes those methods to accepts `&dyn SerializeRow`.\r\n\r\nAs a small side change I removed `RowSerializationContext::column_by_name`.\r\nColumns need to be serialized in order, so there is no reason to get the column out of order.\r\nThis is confirmed by this method being unused.\r\n\r\n## Creating RowSerializationContext from Table\r\n\r\nSee the commit \"Table: Add Vec of primary key column specs\" for an explanation.\r\nI'm not sure that the approach I've taken is the best one, so I'm open t suggestions in this matter.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/1152\r\n\r\n##

Proposed release notes:\r\n\r\nThe ScyllaDB team is pleased to announce ScyllaDB Rust Driver 0.15.1,\r\nan asynchronous CQL driver for Rust, optimized for Scylla, but also compatible with Apache Cassandra!\r\n\r\nSome interesting statistics:\r\n\r\n- over 2.692k downloads on crates!\r\n- over 590 GitHub stars!\r\n\r\n### Changes by category:\r\n\r\n**New features / enhancements:**\r\n- Migrated tablets to the new deserialization framework ([#1120](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1120)).\r\n- Added `automatically_derived` attribute to impls auto-generated by derive macros ([#1145](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1145)).\r\n- Made fields of `ConnectionSetupRequestError` public ([#1131](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1131)).\r\n\r\n**Bug fixes:**\r\n- Allowed serialization of columns/fields that are not valid Rust identifiers ([#1137](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1137)).\r\n- Fixed bug that occured when preparing batch statements targetting multiple tables ([#1135](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1135)).\r\n- Fixed bug that when there were fewer batch statements than batch values provided, `session.batch()` would silently drop extra values ([#1142](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1142)).\r\n\r\n**API cleanups / better types:**\r\n- Deprecated remnants of the legacy framework and items belonging to the legacy serialization framework ([#1141](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1141)).\r\n- Removed uses of the legacy `SerializedValuesError` ([#1149](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1149)).\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n- Updated the docs about time types to reflect the new name of the feature flag (`chrono` -> `chrono-04`) ([#1123](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1123), [#1110](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1110)).\r\n\r\n**CI / developer tool improvements:**\r\n- Moved most of tests that require a running cluster to integration tests ([#1102](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1102)).\r\n- Attempted to combat \"group 0 concurrent modification\" error in CI by sending DDL changes always to the same node ([#1127](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1127)).\r\n- clippy was appeased again ([#1136](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1136)).\r\n\r\n**Others:**\r\n- Implemented `QueryRowsResult::into_inner` behind `cpp_rust_unstable` cfg for use in cpp-rust-driver ([#1133](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1133)).\r\n- Removed unnecessary clone in `PoolRefiller::use_keyspace` ([#1143](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1143)).\r\n\r\nCongrats to all contributors and thanks everyone for using our driver!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe source code of the driver can be found here:\r\n- [https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver)\r\nContributions are most welcome!\r\n\r\nThe official crates.io registry entry is here:\r\n- [https://crates.io/crates/scylla](https://crates.io/crates/scylla)\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions, issues, feature requests, or are simply interested in our driver!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/1150/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":

Proposed release notes:\r\n\r\nThe ScyllaDB team is pleased to announce ScyllaDB Rust Driver 0.15.0,\r\nan asynchronous CQL driver for Rust, optimized for Scylla, but also compatible with Apache Cassandra!\r\n\r\nSome interesting statistics:\r\n\r\n- over 2.516k downloads on crates!\r\n- over 583 GitHub stars!\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nBeginning with this release, instead of putting all API-breaking changes into one group, now they are in the proper categories, but labeled as \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]**.\r\n\r\n### Main changes:\r\n\r\n#### New deserialization API\r\n\r\nThe main change in this release is the deserialization API refactor. Its primary goal was to reduce overhead caused by all rows being eagerly deserialized to type-erased `CqlValue` type, only then being converted to end user types.\r\nOld traits and structs (`FromCqlVal`, `FromRow`, `QueryResult` - renamed to `LegacyQueryResult`, `RowIterator` - renamed to `LegacyRowIterator`, `TypedRowIterator` - renamed to `LegacyTypedRowIterator`) are replaced by new ones (`DeserializeValue`, `DeserializeRow`, new `QueryResult`, `QueryPager`, `TypedRowStream`). There are wrappers and helper implementations provided, designed to aid in gradually migrating to new API - see the migration guide in the book for more information. Old traits and structs will be removed in one of future versions.\r\n\r\nNew serialization API has a benefit of increased efficiency - now, rows are deserialized straight to the end user type, without any copying and allocations on the way.\r\nAnother feature is the ability to deserialize rows to borrowed types (e.g. `&str` or `&[u8]`).\r\nAnd the result metadata is now deserialized in the borrowed form, saving even more allocations.\r\n\r\nThe refactor included:\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Parametrized `Deserialize{Value,Row}` with two lifetimes: `'frame` and `'metadata` separately ([#1101](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1101)).\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** The deserialization refactor was finished ([#1088](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1088), [#1107](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1107), [#1109](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1109), [#1093](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1093), [#1057](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1057), [#1120](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1120), [#1118](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1118), [#1122](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1122), [#1121](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1121)).\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Unified macro attributes' syntax and semantics between serialization and deserialization derive macros ([#1119](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1119)).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes by category:\r\n\r\n**New features / enhancements:**\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Made `ResultMetadata` lifetime-generic, which paved a path to deserializing metadata in a borrowed way as an optimisation to save allocations ([#1082](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1082)).\r\n- Exported serialization migration macros that accidentally hadn't been exported before ([#1089](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1089)).\r\n- Exposed public getters to type-erased errors ([#1087](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1087)).\r\n- Trace message is now issued upon successful keepalive ([#1092](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1092)).\r\n- Added `SerializeRow` impl for `Box<T: SerializeRow>` ([#1105](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1105)).\r\n- Exposed public getters for execution profile configuration ([#1104](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1104)).\r\n- Allowed public access to the profile associated with an execution profile handle ([#1112](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1112)).\r\n\r\n**Bug fixes:**\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Fixed driver's logic that bases on error variants returned from query execution ([#1075](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1075)).\r\n- Fixed possible panic in speculative execution ([#1086](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1086))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Disallowed deserializing Counter type to plain `i64` for type safety ([#1106](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1106)).\r\n- Fixed logic about ignoring particular error kinds if speculative execution failed ([#1124](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1124)).\r\n\r\n**API cleanups / better types:**\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Some of our error types were restructured to be more strongly typed (instead of just containing a string) and better reflect the conditions that they appear in. This work will be continued in 0.16. ([#1067](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1067), [#1074](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1074), [#1054](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1054), [#1080](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1074), [#1080](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1080), [#1117](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1117)).\r\n- Removed wildcard re-exports of the serialization framework's entities ([#1090](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1090)).\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Made `RetryPolicy` stored behind `Arc` instead of `Box` ([#1103](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1103)).\r\n\r\n**Internal API cleanups/refactors:**\r\n- Removed paging state parameter from unpaged raw `Connection`'s API ([#1084](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1084)).\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Fixed unnameable types in our codebase (by making them exposed, unexposing them or deleting them at all) and enabled the `unnameable_types` clippy lint to prevent having such situation in the future ([#1094](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1094)).\r\n- Tiny optimizations and code refactors ([#1108](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1108)).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n- Updated docs theme ([#1081](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1081), [#1110](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1110)).\r\n\r\n\r\n**CI / developer tool improvements:**\r\n- clippy was appeased again ([#1072](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1072), [#1077](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1077), [#1095](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1095)).\r\n- Pinned Rust version in `book.yml` CI workflow ([#1096](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1096)).\r\n\r\n**Others:**\r\n- Rewritten RELEASE.md, so that it now contains up-to-date guide about maintaining and releasing the driver ([#1076](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1076)).\r\n- Bumped MSRV to 1.70 ([#1098](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1098)).\r\n- Added an example showing Counter UPDATE ([#1100](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1100)).\r\n\r\n\r\nCongrats to all contributors and thanks everyone for using our driver!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe source code

PR with changes for release 1.0.0. Its purpose is to make it possible to review the release notes, and changes to README.md.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/968\r\nFixes: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/issues/552\r\n\r\n## Current release notes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ScyllaDB team is pleased to announce ScyllaDB Rust Driver 1.0.0,\r\nan asynchronous CQL driver for Rust, optimized for Scylla, but also compatible with Apache Cassandra!\r\n\r\nSome interesting statistics:\r\n\r\n- over 3.162k downloads on crates!\r\n- over 612 GitHub stars!\r\n\r\n## Stabilization\r\n\r\n1.0 has a special meaning for Rust crates - it means that the crate is considered \"API-stable\" - however there is no specific definition of what it means to be \"API-stable\".\r\nSo what does it mean to us, and why did we release this version?\r\nUp until now, we introduced breaking changes whenever we felt we could improve the API this way (sometimes we kept the old API for a bit, and provided a migration guide). This caused the vast majority of our releases to have to bump the major version number - we didn't reach minor version greater than \"2\" for a few years now. This is not a great situation for our users, because it means it is basically never possible to update the driver without adjusting their codebases.\r\nAt the same time we know that we can't (and don't want to) freeze the API forever - there are still many improvements we can make, and the databases (Scylla / Cassandra) are always changing, which sometimes requires breaking changes on our part (an example of this is Tablets feature in Scylla, which required us to change our load balancing APIs). This means we won't stay on 1.x forever.\r\nWe decided to stabilize the API by providing a guarantee regarding how long a breaking change won't occur, which will allows users to better allocate time for dealing with breakage. For the 1.0, we won't release 2.0 earlier than 9 months after 1.0 (but we may release it later). Until then we will release minor (1.x) versions. In 1.x versions we may of course introduce new APIs, and [deprecate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostics.html#the-deprecated-attribute) old ones, but there will be no breaking changes.\r\nTwo exceptions that may force us to release major versions quicker are:\r\n- urgent security issues\r\n- changes in Scylla / Cassandra that have to be supported by driver quickly and there is no way to implement them without a major version bump.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing new major version (e.g. 2.0) we will continue to provide bugfixes (but no new features) for the previous major version (e.g. 1.0). The exact duration of such bugfix support will be provided after the new major version is released.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, 1.0 release signifies that we view the driver as production ready. It has been for a long time now, but the 0.x version number may have been suggesting otherwise to some people, and we don't want to send mixed signals.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**New features / enhancements:**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Support for Rustls as a TLS provider was added. With this change you can connect to Scylla with TLS without having additional system C libraries installed! ([#1254](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1254))\r\n- Added Timestamp Generators. This is a user-customizable way of generating client-side timestamps for requests. ([#1128](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1128))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Driver metrics performance was improved. Previously they used `Mutex` internally, causing performance problems because of contention. Now `AtomicHistogram` is used to avoid this problem. Additionally, metrics are now guarded by `metrics` feature, so that the users who don't need them don't have to pay the performance cost and introduce additional dependency. ([#1263](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1263))\r\n- Borrowed versions of CqlVarint and CqlDecimal were added. ([#1148](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1148))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** In metadata, MissingUserDefinedType is no longer part of `CqlType::UserDefinedType`. Now, in case of this (and some other errors) the metadata fetch for given keyspace will be aborted (and warning printed), returning previous version of this keyspace if possible. ([#1162](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1162))\r\n- Metadata fetching now verifies that partition key and clustering key indexes have no holes. Thanks to that the users now have guarantee that column names from `Table::partition_key` and `Table::clustering_key` are present in `Table::columns`. If this is not the case, fetch is failed only for this keyspace, as above. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `Node::is_down` was made private, instead new method `Node::is_connected` was introduced. The old method has very misleading semantics. The new one tells if there are currently any driver connections opened to given node. ([#1196](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1196))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Added partial `Vector` support. Driver can now correctly fetch metadata of tables with vector columns. Serializing / deserializing vector values will be added after 1.0. ([#1020](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1020))\r\n- `Display` was implemented for `CqlValue`. ([#1257](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1257))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `rand` dependency was updated to 0.9.0. This is a breaking change, because a trait from `rand` appears in `ReplicaSet::choose_filtered` method. ([#1255](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1255))\r\n- Made all internal queries to `system.local` table use `WHERE key='local'` which should be a minor performance improvement. ([#1245](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1245))\r\n- Implemented `Debug` for `MaybeUnset`.  ([#1199](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1199))\r\n\r\n**Bug fixes:**\r\n\r\n- `Debug` implementation on `CachingSession` was not usable due to unsatisfiable bounds. ([#1161](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1161))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Our derive macros were not fully hygienic. This was discovered when migrating the hygiene test to new ser/deser frameworks. Issue was fixed, test was migrated and extended to cover more scenarios. Fixing hygiene required moving some modules in `scylla-cql`, so the change is breaking - but it should not affect users. ([#1176](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1176))\r\n\r\n**API cleanups / better types:**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Most of the driver module structure was reworked. Before most of the files were put in the non-descriptive \"transport\" module. Now our top-level modules are much more clear: `authentication`, `client`, `cluster`, `network`, `observability`, `policies`, `response`, `routing`, `statement`, `utils`. Some structs and method were also renamed as part of this effort. Unfortunately, this is a big change that will require users of our driver to update most of their `use` statements. ([#1163](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1163), [#1187](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1187))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `CqlType` was removed, and `ColumnType` is used in its place. To make this possible, `ColumnType` was heavily modified. ([#1166](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1166))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Errors refactor, started a few versions ago, was finished. Credits to @muzarski for this incredible work. ([#1204](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1204), [#1200](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1200), [#1191](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1191), [#1194](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1194), [#1193](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1193), [#1201](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1201), [#1192](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1192), [#1185](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1185), [#1180](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1180), [#1170](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1170), [#1181](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1181), [#1160](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1160), [#1159](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1159), [#1157](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1157), [#1168](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1168))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Old serialization and deserialization frameworks were fully removed, after being deprecated in previous version of the driver. ([#1184](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1184))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** After legacy APIs were removed it became clear that module structure of `scylla-cql` has a lot of problems. Many of them were addressed, which of course is a very breaking change. ([#1198](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1198))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** APIs related to TLS were refactored when adding support for Rustls. This will enable us to add further providers in the future without breaking backwards compatibility. ([#1254](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1254))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `Query` was renamed to `Statement`.  ([#1250](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1250))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Removed `SerializedValues` from public API of `scylla` crate. Functions using it were either changed to using `&dyn SerializeRow` or deemed unnecessary and removed from the public API.  Error types of `ClusterState` token calculation APIs were changed as part of this. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n- `ColumnSpecView` and `TableSpecView` were removed. `ColumnSpecs` received a second lifetime. `PreparedStatement::get_variable_col_specs` and `PreparedStatement::get_result_set_col_specs` now return `ColumnSpecs` to make it consistent with `QueryRowsResult` and `QueryPager`. ([#1249](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1249))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Low-level partition APIs were made private. `PreparedStatement::get_partitioner_name()` was made `pub`.

([#1202](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1202))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Derive macro paths were made consistent, so that there is a single place to import a macro from. ([#1260](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1260))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `ClusterState` now has getter and iterator for keyspaces, instead of exposing `HashMap<String, Keyspace>`.

This caused the vast majority of our releases to have to bump the major version number - we didn't reach minor version greater than \"2\" for a few years now. This is not a great situation for our users, because it means it is basically never possible to update the driver without adjusting their codebases.\r\nAt the same time we know that we can't (and don't want to) freeze the API forever - there are still many improvements we can make, and the databases (Scylla / Cassandra) are always changing, which sometimes requires breaking changes on our part (an example of this is Tablets feature in Scylla, which required us to change our load balancing APIs). This means we won't stay on 1.x forever.\r\nWe decided to stabilize the API by providing a guarantee regarding how long a breaking change won't occur, which will allows users to better allocate time for dealing with breakage. For the 1.0, we won't release 2.0 earlier than 9 months after 1.0 (but we may release it later). Until then we will release minor (1.x) versions. In 1.x versions we may of course introduce new APIs, and [deprecate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostics.html#the-deprecated-attribute) old ones, but there will be no breaking changes.\r\nTwo exceptions that may force us to release major versions quicker are:\r\n- urgent security issues\r\n- changes in Scylla / Cassandra that have to be supported by driver quickly and there is no way to implement them without a major version bump.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing new major version (e.g. 2.0) we will continue to provide bugfixes (but no new features) for the previous major version (e.g. 1.0). The exact duration of such bugfix support will be provided after the new major version is released.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, 1.0 release signifies that we view the driver as production ready. It has been for a long time now, but the 0.x version number may have been suggesting otherwise to some people, and we don't want to send mixed signals.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**New features / enhancements:**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Support for Rustls as a TLS provider was added. With this change you can connect to Scylla with TLS without having additional system C libraries installed! ([#1254](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1254))\r\n- Added Timestamp Generators. This is a user-customizable way of generating client-side timestamps for requests. ([#1128](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1128))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Driver metrics performance was improved. Previously they used `Mutex` internally, causing performance problems because of contention. Now `AtomicHistogram` is used to avoid this problem. Additionally, metrics are now guarded by `metrics` feature, so that the users who don't need them don't have to pay the performance cost and introduce additional dependency. ([#1263](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1263))\r\n- Borrowed versions of CqlVarint and CqlDecimal were added. ([#1148](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1148))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** In metadata, MissingUserDefinedType is no longer part of `CqlType::UserDefinedType`. Now, in case of this (and some other errors) the metadata fetch for given keyspace will be aborted (and warning printed), returning previous version of this keyspace if possible. ([#1162](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1162))\r\n- Metadata fetching now verifies that partition key and clustering key indexes have no holes. Thanks to that the users now have guarantee that column names from `Table::partition_key` and `Table::clustering_key` are present in `Table::columns`. If this is not the case, fetch is failed only for this keyspace, as above. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `Node::is_down` was made private, instead new method `Node::is_connected` was introduced. The old method has very misleading semantics. The new one tells if there are currently any driver connections opened to given node. ([#1196](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1196))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Added partial `Vector` support. Driver can now correctly fetch metadata of tables with vector columns. Serializing / deserializing vector values will be added after 1.0. ([#1020](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1020))\r\n- `Display` was implemented for `CqlValue`. ([#1257](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1257))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `rand` dependency was updated to 0.9.0. This is a breaking change, because a trait from `rand` appears in `ReplicaSet::choose_filtered` method. ([#1255](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1255))\r\n- Made all internal queries to `system.local` table use `WHERE key='local'` which should be a minor performance improvement. ([#1245](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1245))\r\n- Implemented `Debug` for `MaybeUnset`.  ([#1199](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1199))\r\n\r\n**Bug fixes:**\r\n\r\n- `Debug` implementation on `CachingSession` was not usable due to unsatisfiable bounds. ([#1161](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1161))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Our derive macros were not fully hygienic. This was discovered when migrating the hygiene test to new ser/deser frameworks. Issue was fixed, test was migrated and extended to cover more scenarios. Fixing hygiene required moving some modules in `scylla-cql`, so the change is breaking - but it should not affect users. ([#1176](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1176))\r\n\r\n**API cleanups / better types:**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Most of the driver module structure was reworked. Before most of the files were put in the non-descriptive \"transport\" module. Now our top-level modules are much more clear: `authentication`, `client`, `cluster`, `network`, `observability`, `policies`, `response`, `routing`, `statement`, `utils`. Some structs and method were also renamed as part of this effort. Unfortunately, this is a big change that will require users of our driver to update most of their `use` statements. ([#1163](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1163), [#1187](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1187))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `CqlType` was removed, and `ColumnType` is used in its place. To make this possible, `ColumnType` was heavily modified. ([#1166](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1166))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Errors refactor, started a few versions ago, was finished. Credits to @muzarski for this incredible work. ([#1204](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1204), [#1200](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1200), [#1191](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1191), [#1194](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1194), [#1193](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1193), [#1201](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1201), [#1192](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1192), [#1185](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1185), [#1180](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1180), [#1170](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1170), [#1181](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1181), [#1160](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1160), [#1159](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1159), [#1157](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1157), [#1168](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1168))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Old serialization and deserialization frameworks were fully removed, after being deprecated in previous version of the driver. ([#1184](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1184))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** After legacy APIs were removed it became clear that module structure of `scylla-cql` has a lot of problems. Many of them were addressed, which of course is a very breaking change. ([#1198](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1198))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** APIs related to TLS were refactored when adding support for Rustls. This will enable us to add further providers in the future without breaking backwards compatibility. ([#1254](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1254))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** `Query` was renamed to `Statement`.  ([#1250](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1250))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Removed `SerializedValues` from public API of `scylla` crate. Functions using it were either changed to using `&dyn SerializeRow` or deemed unnecessary and removed from the public API.  Error types of `ClusterState` token calculation APIs were changed as part of this. ([#1252](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1252))\r\n- `ColumnSpecView` and `TableSpecView` were removed. `ColumnSpecs` received a second lifetime. `PreparedStatement::get_variable_col_specs` and `PreparedStatement::get_result_set_col_specs` now return `ColumnSpecs` to make it consistent with `QueryRowsResult` and `QueryPager`. ([#1249](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1249))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Low-level partition APIs were made private. `PreparedStatement::get_partitioner_name()` was made `pub`. ([#1222](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver/pull/1222))\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **[API-breaking]** Marked various structures and enums `#[non_exhaustive]` because we may want to add new variants to them in the future.
