https://github.com/alexcrichton/tar-rs/pull/274\r\n\r\nAnd I'll just copy/paste the commit message from there, lightly edited:\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree we generate a cryptographic\r\nchecksum over files and symlinks, and directories.\r\n\r\nostree does not currently perform any canonicalization on symlinks;\r\nwe'll respect and honor whatever bytes we're provided as input,\r\nand replicate that on the target.\r\n\r\nWe're using the Rust tar crate to do tar serialization,\r\nwhich has so far worked fine...except, I hit this corner case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@cosa-devsh ~]# rpm -qf /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install\r\nchkconfig-1.13-2.el8.x86_64\r\n[root@cosa-devsh ~]# ll /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install\r\nlrwxrwxrwx. 2 root root 24 Nov 29 18:08 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install -> ../../..//sbin/chkconfig\r\n[root@cosa-devsh ~]#\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, using `set_link_name` to write the tarball, we end up with\r\nthe canonicalized path `../../../sbin/chkconfig` - i.e. without the\r\ndouble `//`.  This breaks the checksum.\r\n\r\nNow, I am a bit tempted to change ostree to do canonicalization.  But\r\neven if we did, I'd need to *exactly* match what tar-rs is doing.\r\n\r\n(I may of course also try to change the rhel8 systemd package, but\r\n that's going to take a while to propagate and this corner case isn't\r\n the only one I'm sure)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/165/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
