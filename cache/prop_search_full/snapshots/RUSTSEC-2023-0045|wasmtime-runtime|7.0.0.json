The list of\r\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all communication adheres to the [code of\r\nconduct](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs discussed with @saulecabrera and @alexcrichton, this PR adds in some refactors that will make the initial Winch integration with `wasmtime` smoother. At a high level:\r\n\r\n- move shared code into the new `wasmtime-cranelift-shared` crate, which will provide a temporary location to put shared code between Winch and Cranelift while we see what patterns need to be abtracted\r\n- combine some Isa operations under a shared `IsaBuilder` trait\r\n- have the `enable_incremental_compilation` method on the `wasmtime_environ::CompilerBuilder` trait return a `Result` so the implementation can decide if it's supported or not\r\n\r\nBig thanks to @alexcrichton for helping out here! I ended up using a lot of his first pass (compared to my much messier version \ud83d\ude1b).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5944/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5944/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5939", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5939/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5939/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5939/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5939", "id": 1611701261, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBhDaXM5LYjRg", "number": 5939, "title": "Release Wasmtime 6.0.1", "user": {"login": "wasmtime-publish", "id": 59749941, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ5OTQx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59749941?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish", "html_url": "https://github.com/wasmtime-publish", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wasmtime-publish/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1843568109, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxODQzNTY4MTA5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/wasmtime:c-api", "name": "wasmtime:c-api", "color": "006b75", "default": false, "description": "Issues pertaining to the C API."}, {"id": 1877824860, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxODc3ODI0ODYw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/cranelift", "name": "cranelift", "color": "f9d0c4", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to the Cranelift code generator"}, {"id": 1877975109, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxODc3OTc1MTA5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/cranelift:meta", "name": "cranelift:meta", "color": "ea48b4", "default": false, "description": "Everything related to the meta-language."}, {"id": 1907753255, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTA3NzUzMjU1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/cranelift:module", "name": "cranelift:module", "color": "ededed", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 1907753318, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTA3NzUzMzE4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/cranelift:wasm", "name": "cranelift:wasm", "color": "ededed", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 3552806557, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBhDaXM7Tw4ad", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/isle", "name": "isle", "color": "E40E9C", "default": false, "description": "Related to the ISLE domain-specific language"}, {"id": 5021130657, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBhDaXM8AAAABK0hfoQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/winch", "name": "winch", "color": "4DE22F", "default": false, "description": "Winch issues or pull requests"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-03-06T15:47:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-08T19:03:54Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-08T19:03:53Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pulls/5939", "html_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5939", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5939.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5939.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-08T19:03:53Z"}, "body": "This is an [automated pull request][process] from CI to create a patch\nrelease for Wasmtime 6.0.1, requested by @alexcrichton.\n\nIt's recommended that maintainers double-check that [RELEASES.md]\nis up-to-date and that there are no known issues before merging this\nPR.
