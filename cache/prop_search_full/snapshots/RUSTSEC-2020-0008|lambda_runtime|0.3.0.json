removes the `#[lambda]` macro from this library. @davidbarsky provided the following valid reasons for why this should be done:\r\n\r\n* Compiler error reporting is not handled correctly using this macro, so the spans where an error occurs are undefined and point to incorrect locations.\r\n* Using this macro conflates warm and cold starts for Lambda functions, as this removes the ability to initialize global resources that might panic if initialized twice, such as a global logger.\r\n\r\nGiven that the alternative to using this macro is a single line addition to a `main` function, there is no real need to continue supporting this macro.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [*] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n- [*] I

Since [AWS X-Ray is now availible in GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/aws-x-ray-now-available-in-aws-govcloud-us-regions/), we can make the trace id in the context non-optional.\r\n2. The (internal) runtime client is now takes a `&self` instead of a `&mut self`, reducing how many `.clone()`s we need need to write. This also means that the client no longer implements `tower::Service`, but given that functionality wasn't used _anyways_, I don't consider this to much of a loss.\r\n3. We're now modeling the incoming events as a stream using the (awesome!) [genawaiter](https://docs.rs/genawaiter/0.99.1/genawaiter/) crate. This can be replaced with a manual stream implementation + [pin_project_lite](https://docs.rs/pin-project-lite/0.1.4/pin_project_lite/) in the future. Side note: the Lambda Runtime server-side APIs (for those unfamiliar, the Firecracker boxes) suspend the function once they receive the `next_event` call, _not_ the response handler. This allows for races to be cleanly-side stepped.\r\n\r\nStill upcoming:\r\n\r\n1. `tracing` support for logs, metrics, and distributed tracing (e.g., AWS X-Ray Integration).\r\n2. Docs!\r\n3. Refactoring the test support to not rely sending requests over localhost as per https://github.com/davidbarsky/stuff. Props to Dylan Marriner on the Lambda team and @gardnervickers for the tip and approach.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request\r\n\r\n- [X] I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of

You can now write a Lambda function similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```rust \r\nuse lambda::lambda;\r\nuse serde_json::Value;\r\n\r\ntype Error = Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static>;\r\n\r\n#[lambda]\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main(event: Value) -> Result<Value, Error> {\r\n    let _ = lambda::context();\r\n    Ok(event)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the high-level changes:\r\n\r\n- Async/await is the primary interface within a Lambda function. While Lambda does not support concurrent invocations in a single container (concurrency is the responsibility of Lambda-the-service), async/await _does_ allow for concurrent calls to other services.\r\n- Functions no longer need to return a `LambdaError`, as the the stabilization of [`std::any::type_name`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html) removed the need for a Lambda-specific error type.\r\n- Lambda functions can be created and started through the `#[lambda]` annotation. Note that starting a futures executor is still necessary. In the above example, this is handled through the `#[tokio::main]` macro.\r\n- The execution context is not an argument to the handler. Instead, it is a task-local, which is similar to a [thread local](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.LocalKey.html), but specific to a future instead of a thread. The task local can be fetched through free function `lambda::context()`.\r\n\r\n## Advanced Usage\r\n\r\n### The Handler Trait\r\n\r\nFor greater control over a handler, this PR provides a `Handler` trait. It is defined as:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Handler<A, B> {\r\n    /// Errors returned by this handler.\r\n    type Err;\r\n    /// The future response value of this handler.\r\n    type Fut: Future<Output = Result<B, Self::Err>>;\r\n    /// Process the incoming event and return the response asynchronously.\r\n    fn call(&mut self, event: A) -> Self::Fut;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is _not_ implemented in this PR yet, but I'd like to provide a blanket implementation of [`tower::Service`](https://docs.rs/tower/0.3.0/tower/trait.Service.html), which would provide compatibility with Tower's rich ecosystem of middleware. In particular, this would enable the use of [`tracing`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) for rich logging and trace reporting.\r\n\r\n### Without Macros\r\n\r\nFor those that prefer to not make use of the `#[lambda]` macro, a Lambda function can be started with the following code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse lambda::handler_fn;\r\n\r\ntype Error = Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static>;\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n    let func = handler_fn(func);\r\n    lambda::run(func).await?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn func(event: String) -> Result<String, Error> {\r\n    Ok(event)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remaining Work\r\n\r\nFor this PR to land, there are some additional bits of work needed: \r\n- Update documentation to show the usage of this runtime, especially some of the more advanced features.\r\n- Guide customers to _only_ build against the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target. The glibc in the Lambda execution environment is too old to run Rust executables.\r\n- Convert `Executor::run` (see `lambda/src/lib.rs`) to a stream so that Lambda functions can be easily unit-tested _in-memory_. By converting it to a stream, limiting execution via [`SteamExt::take`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.take) or [stream-cancel](https://docs.rs/stream-cancel/0.5.0/stream_cancel/index.html) becomes _much_ easier.\r\n- Provide examples (beyond this library's unit tests) of how to test a Lambda function.\r\n- Provide examples of using the runtime with [tokio-compat](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-compat) and Rusoto, if Rusoto doesn't support async/await prior to this PR landing.\r\n- Figure out how to support `http`-based Lambdas through the `#[lambda]` macro. I think an attribute like `#[lambda::http]` dispatching to an `Executor::run_http` method is the best approach until specialization is stable.\r\n- Release `tracing`/AWS X-Ray integration.\r\n\r\ncc:
