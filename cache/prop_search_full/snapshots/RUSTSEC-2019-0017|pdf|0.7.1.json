Previously, only revision 3 of the standard security handler was supported. This PR adds support for the preceding revision 2 handler, and later formats using AES-128 and AES-256. I added some small test files covering each format, which were generated by encrypting the `example.pdf` test file with different settings.\r\n\r\nAs AES-128 and AES-256 encrypted streams/strings use CBC mode, with PKCS#7 padding, decryption can now fail, whereas previously with RC4 it could only return garbage. The spec states that certain strings in the document are not encrypted, such as the /ID in the trailer, and the contents of the /Encrypt dictionary. As such, the encryption `Decoder` can now take the indirect object reference of the /Encrypt dictionary, and it will skip trying to decrypt any strings within it. (If it tried to decrypt them with a /CFM of /AESV2 or /AESV3, it would throw a padding error when parsing it after the encryption state had been set up. Note also that /ID is read once when the trailer is parsed into a `primitive::Dictionary`, before the encryption state is set up, so no change is needed here.)\r\n\r\nI also did a couple small refactors along the way, to extract common dictionary parsing code, and separated parsing the trailer and setting up decryption out from the following `Trailer::from_primitive()` call, for users such as myself to access the original trailer dictionary.\r\n\r\nWith the new test files, the integration test covers each encryption format, and there is a new unit test to cover plaintext strings in /Encrypt in a minimal RC4 encrypted file.\r\n\r\nNote that owner passwords still aren't supported; I may do a follow-up PR later to add support for that in each revision.", "reactions": {"url":
