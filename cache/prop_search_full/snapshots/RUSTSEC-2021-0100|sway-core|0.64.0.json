continuation of #6179, and follows on from PR #6501. These are broken into separate PRs so that we can discuss each PR `HEAD` separately so that the PRs that can get merged, do so quickly. Otherwise, the further along they get stale the more work they all need in order to keep up to `master` without being hard to find which change introduced a possible broken build.\r\n\r\nThis PR only does a version bump to every crate dependency that does not need any code changes to apply cleanly.\r\n\r\nFollowing this PR will be a new PR, where every commit updates a single crate along with the files that were needed to be changed in order to work again. The crates that will need code changes are:\r\n\r\n- tokio 1.12: -> 1.40\r\n- rustc-hash: 1.1 -> 2.0\r\n- miden-core: 0.3 -> 0.10\r\n- notify: 5.0 -> 6.1\r\n- notify-debouncer-mini: 0.2 -> 0.4\r\n- revm: 2.3 -> 14.0\r\n- syn: 1.0 -> 2.0\r\n- tikv-jemallocator: 0.5 -> 0.6\r\n- toml_edit: 0.21 -> 0.22\r\n\r\nThere should also be a commit to upgrade Rust itself to >= `1.81.0`.\r\n\r\n... and for another day, there's 3 crates that will take a bit of time to get working, and so will go under a different issue #6536:\r\n\r\n- annotate-snippets\r\n- lsp-types\r\n- uint\r\n\r\n##

Some of those instructions were up to now partially supported in IR and ASM generation but not in ASM blocks. The immediate motivation for adding support for these instructions is the need for `wqml` instruction in the new implementation of `u256::pow()`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the PR adds expressive diagnostics for `UnrecognizedOpCode` parsing error.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation where relevant (API docs, the reference, and the Sway book).\r\n   - [ ] If my change requires substantial documentation changes, I have [requested

that we use the first element of the array as its element type. This can be problematic as the first element is not \"concrete\". For example, when it is `Numeric`.\r\n\r\nNow we iterate the array elements, search for the first \"good\" element, and use its type as the array type. This means:\r\n1 - if the type is concrete, we use it;\r\n2 - if the type is `Numeric`, we keep searching for something better;\r\n\r\nThis allows consistent arrays, but where the concrete types are at the end.\r\n\r\n```sway\r\nlet a = [1, 2u8]; <- we will choose u8\r\nlet a = [None, Some(1), Some(2u8)]; <- we will choose Option<u8>, instead of Option<T>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## snapshot tests\r\n\r\nThis PR also brings an experiment. Now when an \"e2e\"  test has a file `snapshot.toml` it will run as `cargo insta` snapshot tests. These tests can be run as normal: `cargo r -p test`, and in two new ways:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> cargo t -p test\r\n> cargo insta test\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnapshots can be reviewed using normal \"cargo insta\" workflow.\r\n\r\nThe secret lies in https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/libtest-mimic. **I also want to suggest that all our tests migrate to this model**, where we could just use \"cargo test\" normally. Apart from that, I opted to use the `forc` executable, which means tests will run in parallel. In the future, if we want to poke compiler internals, we can expose them using flags, or create a special binary to fit our needs.\r\n\r\n`snapshot.toml` is still empty because I have no idea to what put there at the moment. My initial idea was to configure what ends up into snapshots (multiple runs, compiler flags, script/contract calls) etc... But for the moment, empty is enough.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [ ] I have
