to assert that a proposal was no longer in scope once committed. After some digging, I realized\r\nthat this was unnecessary. \r\n\r\nThere was the `ProposalBase` enum that we used to build a layerable in-memory database off an existing view (like the EmptyDb). However, neither are in use and created confusion with the other Proposal object. So, they were removed as part of unwrapping the Arc around proposals.\r\n\r\nA nit change also was to give names to all of the lifetimes in the proposal and db traits. Naming the lifetimes makes it easier to understand their purpose (though, I avoided the FFI package to save myself some rebase pains).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1160/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1160/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1140", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1140/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1140/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/issues/1140/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1140", "id": 3263060164, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJV-Kkc6gn4Ra", "number": 1140, "title": "build(deps): update criterion requirement from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 8257074321, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJV-Kkc8AAAAB7Cj0kQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "0366d6", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update a dependency file"}, {"id": 8257074327, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJV-Kkc8AAAAB7Cj0lw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/labels/rust", "name": "rust", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update rust code"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-07-25T12:29:31Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-25T13:42:24Z", "closed_at": "2025-07-25T13:42:22Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ava-labs/firewood/pulls/1140", "html_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1140", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1140.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood/pull/1140.patch", "merged_at": "2025-07-25T13:42:22Z"}, "body": "Updates the requirements on [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">criterion's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[0.6.0] - 2025-05-17</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>MSRV bumped to 1.80</li>\n<li>The <code>real_blackbox</code> feature no longer has any impact.

"feat(deferred-allocate): Part 3: Defer allocate\r\n\r\nThis implements deferred allocaion that delays allocating space for\r\nnodes until commit time.\r\n\r\nThe nodestore refactor consisted of removing the 'new' hashmap, which\r\nmapped newly allocated nodes to their contents in a proposal. Instead,\r\nnow we store those newly allocated nodes directly from the `Child`\r\nstruct.\r\n\r\nThe implementation constisted of:\r\n - A new type, NodeAllocator, to consolidate all the allocation code\r\n - Removing the 'new' hashmap, as freshly allocatred nodes are found\r\n   by traversing the trie and inspecting their state\r\n - Use the most recently committed revision's freelist to allocate\r\n   new nodes. This will change in a future revision when the freelist\r\n   is tied to storage rather than the revision.\r\n - Rewrite flush_nodes to serialize then allocate. Previously, the node\r\n   was serialized twice, once to determine the size during proposal\r\n   creation (allocation time) and once to store it\r\n - Changes to the commit flow by separating the node persistence logic\r\n   (see comments in commit.rs)\r\n\r\nSome miscellaneous changes included in this diff (could be split out):\r\n - Branch children iterators can no longer return reference to hashes,\r\n   since they are sometimes behind an ArcSwap\r\n - Propogate logger feature in fwdctl (helped with debugging)\r\n - Remove use of stored_len in tests\r\n - size_from_area_index was a method on nodestore, but didn't use\r\n   nodestore\r\n - uncached_node_and_size was dead code\r\n - New clippy lint for hash_helper not needing &self in non-ethhash\r\n   fixed\r\n\r\nTask completion status:\r\n  [x] Roots may not be persisted (Part 1: #1041)\r\n  [x] BranchNode children can now be Node, LinearAddress or a\r\nMaybePersistedNode (Part 2: #1045 and #1047)\r\n  [x] When converting a `MutableProposal` to an `ImmutableProposal`,\r\ndon't actually allocate space, just create `SharedNode`s from the\r\n`Node`s. (Part 3: #1055 and this PR)\r\n  [ ] Remove `NodeStoreHeader` from `NodeStore`. The header should move\r\ninto the `RevisionManager`.\r\n  [ ] Allocate new nodes from the recently-freed nodes from an expired\r\nrevision, then from the freelist. This can be done by maintaining a\r\nlocal freelist from the nodes deleted in the expiring revision and\r\nfalling back to the actual freelist.

If this area is allocated for a trie node, the root or the parent trie node will be returned. If this area is free, the free list head or the parent of this free area is returned. We return the parent because, if we were to fix the misalignment issue (by migrating to another area or remove it from the free list), the parent pointer needs to be updated accordingly. \r\n\r\nAs a side effect, `FreeListIterator` will return the parent of the free list item. This design can help checker fix various issues it sees when traversing the free list but will add some overhead if it is used for other purposes.
