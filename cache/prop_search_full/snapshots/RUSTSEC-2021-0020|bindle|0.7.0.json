This new\r\nprovider is behind a feature flag and is not compiled into `bindle-server`\r\nby default. Tests have also been updated to check both providers, but\r\nthe client tests still only test with the `FileProvider`.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this is that the file system provider requires a bunch of\r\nbespoke logic to check things like locking and various OS specific things. We\r\nalso have to front everything with an in-memory LRU cache. Tools like `sled`\r\nalready have most of these features built in, plus additional guarantees from\r\nbeing a database (such as atomic transations and upsert commands). This also\r\nuses a binary encoding format to store the data using less bytes and to\r\ndecrease serialization and deserialization time. All of these reasons\r\nsounded like pretty good justification for giving it a whirl.
