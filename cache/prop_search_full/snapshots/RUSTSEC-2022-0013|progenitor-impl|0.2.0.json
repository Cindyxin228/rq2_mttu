Unfortunately this is a regression from the changes we made in 0.4.20 where we now parse the timezone database ourselves. Before 0.4.20, <code>TimeZone::now()</code> fell back to UTC in the case it could not find the current timezone, but the new implementation panicked in that case.</li>\n<li>Correctly detect timezone on Android (also <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/756\">#756</a>). Android does have the timezone database installed, but it's in a different path, and it does not use <code>/etc/localtime</code> to keep track of the current timezone. Instead we now use the iana-time-zone crate as a dependency, since it already has quite a bit of logic for finding the current timezone on a host of platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, there is a documentation fix that reverts an incorrect guarantee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Document that <code>%Y</code> can have a negative value, both in formatting and in parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/760\">#760</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alex\"><code>@\u200balex</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">chrono's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.4.22</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow wasmbindgen to be optional on <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/771\">#771</a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/771\">chronotope/chrono#771</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix compile error for <code>x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx</code> [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/767\">#767</a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/767\">chronotope/chrono#767</a>)</li>\n<li>Update <code>iana-time-zone</code> version to 1.44 [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/773\">#773</a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/773\">chronotope/chrono#773</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.4.21</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fall back to UTC timezone in cases where no timezone is found [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/756\">#756</a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/756\">chronotope/chrono#756</a>)</li>\n<li>Correctly detect timezone on Android [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/756\">#756</a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/756\">chronotope/chrono#756</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve documentation for strftime <code>%Y</code> specifier [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/760\">#760</a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/760\">chronotope/chrono#760</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/45142764ab6e1f2957437aa187970b94d3aaeadc\"><code>4514276</code></a> update changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/db8bde3acf5f39ce8c49f86569cbda36a63665bd\"><code>db8bde3</code></a> Apply clippy suggestions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/f6b575ceee6e87dbbd5311cd262df7cc7ef13997\"><code>f6b575c</code></a> Bump version number to 0.4.22</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/af69b903f66f41788b8fd5b0f62ae032f2214722\"><code>af69b90</code></a> Require iana-time-zone 0.1.44</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/84f98e01c7bc33323a0d3736b91b4e8bdeefacd3\"><code>84f98e0</code></a> set fallback feature in iana-time-zone depedency</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/511d36899037dd9efb0df41cba947d17914883fc\"><code>511d368</code></a> Add sgx build to CI</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/bee614a3050d89a8f1ede2e84aa29cf9d904fa48\"><code>bee614a</code></a> Do not include iana-time-zone for sgx</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/fe4bd220d24496267c9e07807327e50fb3800fce\"><code>fe4bd22</code></a> allow optional wasmbindgen</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/95223ee267ca46fd4fc39c42afe8e0b8a2725b8c\"><code>95223ee</code></a> format: be specific about support year range</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/commit/2d22e57b461e2dbb129fdb53f848be5b970fa49c\"><code>2d22e57</code></a> Bump version number to 0.4.21</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.20...v0.4.22\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=chrono&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.4.20&new-version=0.4.22)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

There has been a long hiatus since the previous maintainer was no longer able to spend much time on the crate; thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/quodlibetor\"><code>@\u200bquodlibetor</code></a> for their stewardship of the chrono crate for many years! The new maintainers are <a href=\"https://github.com/djc\"><code>@\u200bdjc</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/esheppa\"><code>@\u200besheppa</code></a>. Our first priority has been fixing the soundness issues with calls to <code>localtime_r()</code> as first reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/499\">#499</a> and the <a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159\">RUSTSEC-2020-0159 </a> advisory. In order to do this we adapted code from the tz-rs crate maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/x-hgg-x\"><code>@\u200bx-hgg-x</code></a> for use within chrono -- thanks for working on that! With the new implementation, chrono uses safe Rust code to parse the timezone data files on Unix platforms directly instead of relying on libc.</p>\n<p>Due to compatibility reasons, this release does not yet remove the time 0.1 dependency, though chrono 0.4.20 does not depend on the vulnerable parts of the time 0.1.x versions. In a future 0.5 release, we will remove the time dependency.</p>\n<p>The minimum supported Rust version for 0.4.20 is 1.32.0, which is intentionally still quite conservative. If you are using chrono 0.4 with a Rust version older than 1.52, we'd like to hear from you since we'd like to further modernize the code base to ease maintenance.</p>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix
