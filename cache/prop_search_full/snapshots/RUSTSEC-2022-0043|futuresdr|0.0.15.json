filter design methods based on the window method.\r\n- `futuredsp::firdes::kaiser`: Contains methods for generating lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filters by specifying cutoff frequencies, transition bandwidths, and maximum ripple. The design is based on the Kaiser method.\r\n- `futuredsp::math::consts`: Replacement for `std::f32::consts` and `std::f64::consts`. So far only used for pi.\r\n- `futuredsp::math::special_funs`: Special functions. So far includes an approximation of the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero.

There is a `doc_auto_cfg` feature, but it doesn't seem to pick up the features well, so in my limited experimenting we do have to manually specify it.
