The new structure allows to use unsafe methods ended with `_dma` to send/receive data in non blocking mode and call specified `callback` at the end of transfer. The `I2CMasterDma` also have methods for blocking transfers but they returns `nb::Result` and `WouldBlock` if there are operation in progress. Clients must call `handle_dma_interrupt` in DMAx_STREAMy interrupt and `handle_error_interrupt` in I2Cx_ER interrupt for correct working of this structure.\r\n\r\nAt the current stage Start generation and Address sending is blocking anyway, so current implementation have benefits only with high amount of data to transfer. For example, sending image to display.\r\n\r\nI've also prepared example of usage with SSD1306 display and LM75B temperature sensor in [separate repository](https://github.com/SpeedCrash100/stm32f4xx-dma-i2c-example)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/534/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/534/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/527", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/527/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/527/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/527/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/pull/527", "id": 1363748676, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCQKfq84-drpw", "number": 527, "title": "Touchscreen driver", "user": {"login": "Srg213", "id": 67677532, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3Njc3NTMy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67677532?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213", "html_url": "https://github.com/Srg213", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Srg213/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2022-09-06T19:55:32Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-12T05:31:10Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-12T05:31:10Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/pulls/527", "html_url": "https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/pull/527", "diff_url": "https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/pull/527.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/pull/527.patch", "merged_at": "2022-11-12T05:31:10Z"}, "body": "Added example to use the ft6x06 touchpanel controller.

series is dual-bank flash and non-uniform sector sizes, which required quite a bit of code to abstract away. I went through all of the F4 reference manuals and believe that `flash_sectors(...)` function should be correct for all variants. AFAIK, there is no single source about flash layout for all the chips. Moreover, ST [lists](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f4-series.html#products) F429 and F469 with 512 KB of flash as dual-bank, but there is no information about it in the reference manual. I believe this could be an error in the website and only 1 MB chips have dual-bank capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe PAC crate is also missing `DB1M` field for some of the dual-bank capable chips, so for now I hardcoded the bit position in `OPTCR` register.\r\n\r\nThe writable `NorFlash` trait was implemented for the largest sector size of 128 KB, because `embedded-storage` does not intend to supprot non-uniform sectors (see [comment](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/embedded-storage/issues/23#issuecomment-1028112586)). Smaller sectors are erased together in the larger 128 KB group. There was a suggestion to add different types for the smaller sector ranges, but I'm not sure if that is useful?", "reactions": {"url":
