crates:\r\n\r\n\"x11rb-protocol\" contains the protocol definitions and allows parsing\r\nand serialising things. It does not do any actual I/O.\r\n\r\n\"x11rb\" uses x11rb-protocol and implements an X11 client based on this.\r\n\r\nI tried to do as few changes as possible here. Code moves around, but\r\nthe structure of the code is not supposed to change.\r\n\r\nThere is one place where this did not work out:\r\n\r\nPreviously, e.g. CreateWindowRequest had an associated function send().\r\nThis function send the request that it is called on via a given X11\r\nconnection. Since this does I/O, this functionality does not belong into\r\nthe x11rb-protocol crate. Since it is an associated function, it cannot\r\neasily be provided by x11rb.\r\n\r\nFor now, I worked around this problem by turning send() into a \"free\"\r\nfunction. The resulting name collision was dealt by renaming it to e.g.\r\nsend_create_window().\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is a huge commit. This is still a mess and things\r\nshould be cleaned up further in the future, but I didn't want to make\r\nthis commit even larger.
