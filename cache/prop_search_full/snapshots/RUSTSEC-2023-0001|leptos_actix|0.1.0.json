function to walk the Leptos router's app tree and produce a list of routes. Each integration has conversions to parse them into a format for either Actix or Axum, and then a trait to provide a `.leptos_routes()` extension for their respective routers.\r\n\r\nThis lets us avoid any wildcard routes for routing leptos! And allows you to define routes in only one place! We can do some server side error handling, and be a better neighbor for other services.\r\n\r\nI also put in the changes from #241 which are simplified by this change. Take a look and let me know if you spot any issues. The Actix version especially needs some prodding, it's got some fairly involved regexs, as its pathing is quite different from leptos_router.\r\n\r\nThe todo_app_sqlite and todo_app_sqlite_axum extensions have been updated to the new format. I'll update the rest if it looks good. @gbj and @akesson does that look right?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/269/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
