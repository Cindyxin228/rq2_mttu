instrumenting every message automatically if the `with-tracing-0_1` feature is enabled. It's slightly less flexible, as now every message will be instrumented as a child, with no option for `follows_from`. There is also no way to opt-out of instrumentation on a per-send basis. I think these are sensible choices, though.\r\n\r\nThis also expands instrumentation support to separately track the span a message spends in the queue and the span it spends executing. This should allow for finer-grained metrics to be exported via opentelemetry and imported into prometheus for applications using xtra to get more insight into how their actors are performing.\r\n\r\nHere is a complex example from a real-world application, [isixhosa.click](https://isixhosa.click), running in a dev environment:\r\n\r\n![example of how spans are emitted and rendered in jaeger with this change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6688948/175308043-296f0db0-b6d6-40a8-80f8-6321ca81a331.png)\r\n\r\nThe fully-qualified actor and message names are listed in each span, so they can be easily filtered by message and actor type.\r\n\r\nThis should be able to provide [span metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/server_side_metrics/span_metrics/) to users of Grafana Tempo.

It additionally upgrades the capabilities of immediate notifications, address messages, and broadcasts with support for assigning priorities to them. An ordered queue of default-priority messages from addresses is still kept to provide FIFO ordering over default-priority messages, as binary heaps do not preserve this order, so the address message priority queue cannot be used.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n1. **Merge barrage & flume into one channel that is simpler than the sum of its parts** (from a behind-the-scenes perspective). This can be done since the resulting channel is specialised for xtra. The downstream channel code of xtra is a lot simpler as a result\r\n2. **Support for priority messages**. This can be used to make sure that important tasks (like pings/health checks) are not missed whilst handling other messages.\r\n3. **Less memory overhead**. Since the inbox channel is specialised to xtra, much more can be exposed. We can reuse its inner allocation for all kinds of things, including reference counting. The result is that `Address` can be pointer sized!\r\n4. **Less polling overhead**. A minimal amount of work can be done in each poll whilst still easily maintaining priority invariants. Contrast this to the implementation before which required either a defined order of broadcast and select passed to `futures::select`, or `try_recvs` to be interspersed to prevent starvation.\r\n5. **Fewer special cases in the manage loop.** Because anti-starvation polls can be removed, there are fewer special cases in the manage loop. This helps to bring us closer to something like #51 with less boxing overhead. It also simplifies `join` and `select` - the difference is night and day!\r\n6. **Flexibility.** The flexibility of being able to implement whatever we need from a channel, even if it is something super specific (like storing specialised reference counts inside), is very nice.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n1. **More code to maintain in xtra.** Xtra now needs to maintain channel code upstream. However, the code that needs to be maintained is a lot simpler as it's very specialised and only needs to support exactly what xtra needs - e.g, support for synchronous sending, receiving, and channel draining can all be dropped.\r\n2. **Immaturity.** Flume is a more mature channel than the new inbox channel is. This can hopefully be combatted with a robust suite of tests in xtra itself, which would benefit the library in any case, even if we decide to stick with flume/barrage.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that the pros outweigh the cons, so I began to implement this proof of concept.\r\n\r\n## Channel design\r\n\r\nI leaned heavily on my experience working on flume and barrage to create this channel. I borrowed the idea of simply locking the inner channel from flume, since as far as I understand it, channels will always have contention on the head and tail, and whether or not this is resolved through lockless CAS loops or simple locks, this will usually be the limiting factor in speed. Therefore, what is far more important than atomic trickery is just reducing contention on the lock itself. Using a lock really does not produce performance that far off of atomic trickery anyway, and is more than sufficient for this use case. This allows the code to be _much_ simpler to reason about compared to a lockless channel written with the same level of features provided, and it can be in fully safe Rust.\r\n\r\nThe main channel is locked with a std Mutex, as contention is expected (though, not for that long). One consideration could be to use a fair Mutex here. The individual broadcast channels and other things that are not expecting to be heavily contended are locked with Spinlocks, as this minimises the amount of time needed to unlock when no contention is present.\r\n\r\n### Diagram of channel operations\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>An activity diagram of all of the channel operations</summary>\r\n\r\n![A UML activity diagram of the channel operations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6688948/174302817-a1e58d15-4db5-4005-a631-2534eae5a09a.svg)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Unresolved questions\r\n- [x] ~~Use a fair mutex or a parking lot mutex for the inner channel?~~ *Can be resolved in the future if there is interest.*\r\n- [x] Does broadcast need a bound?\r\n- [x] Does priority stealing heap need a bound?

feature resolver needed one feature to be added explicitly to futures-util.\r\n\r\n## Actions\r\nThere are two reasons for making Actions use `minimal-versions`:\r\n1. Unfortunately, since the CI is tested on 1.56 too *without* Cargo.lock being committed, the latest dependencies are always used. This includes updating to those beyond the MSRV of the root crate (xtra) - see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9930. This lead to some CI failures which did not reflect actual MSRV issues with xtra, since the dependencies updated beyond xtra's MSRV had releases allowed by xtra that did support xtra's MSRV.\r\n2.Using `minimal-versions` makes sure that the versions specified in `Cargo.toml` are not incorrect - see [Rust minimum versions: SemVer is a lie!](https://blog.illicitonion.com/2018/06/rust-minimum-versions-semver-is-lie.html).\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and use `minimal-versions` to fix both issues.",

We now only have a single `send` function on both `Address` and `MessageChannel` and we return the same `SendFuture` type in both cases.\r\n\r\nThe `SendFuture` type has a single, publicly accessible function called `recv_async` which allows users to flip the behaviour of `SendFuture` from synchronously awaiting the handler's result to returning a `Receiver` that can be awaited separately.\r\n\r\nThis allows users to _queue_ messages into an actor's mailbox without awaiting the result. As part of merging the two existing `SendFuture` types, we now also provide a consistent \"backpressure\" story: A `SendFuture` that is flipped to receiving the result asynchronously will only complete once the message has been successfully queued into the actor's mailbox. I've added an example that demonstrates this and also a test that make sure we don't break this functionality in the future.", "reactions": {"url":

to thank you for `xtra`. Playing around with it has been a breeze.\r\nI have noticed though that, currently, when using `Address::attach_stream` `stream.next` is waited upon even after the address becomes disconnected. In my particular use-case this has lead to `attach_stream` simply becoming stuck as no new messages are added to the stream.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I had to make some changes - not only to `attach_stream`, but also to `Address` & `Context` to track the status of all contexts attached to one address and to get notified as soon as they drop. After my changes `attach_stream` returns immediatley once the address has become disconnected. Unrelated to this, I added `Address::join` to improve ergonomics when needing to wait for the completion of an actor.\r\n\r\nI had to add the [stream_cancel](https://docs.rs/stream-cancel/) crate as a dependency to deal with stream cancellation and  drop notification. It's pretty lightweight and works well and the `Tripwire` & `Trigger` synchronization primitives are very useful. Please let me know if you want something else instead. I looked through the existing deps and didn't see anything that could be used for this.\r\n\r\nI've also made some changes to `Context::notify_interval` & `Context::notify_after`. Firstly, I added code to automatically stop those background tasks once the context dropped. I also noticed that these background tasks hold strong addresses and could therefore prevent an actor from being stopped. I don't believe this was the intended behaviour, so I added a `downgrade` to make sure the task holds a weak address instread.\r\n\r\nLet me know how you feel about these changes.
