`DirectoryString::BmpString` because Pku2u certificated can contain BmpString. It had been commented out. \r\n    * I've made macros exportable because I need them to deserialize new types from `picky-krb`.\r\n    * Added more OIDs.\r\n* `picky-krb`:\r\n    * Added `negoex` module that contains all new structures and data types needed for the NEGOEX protocol.\r\n    * Added `pkinit` module with implemented structures and data type needed for the PKU2U protocol.\r\n    * Added a few new structures from `MS-KILE` needed for the final authenticator generation (`KerbAdRestrictionEntry`, `LsapTokenInfoIntegrity`).\r\n    * Added new needed constants: key usages, GSS API token IDs, and checksum types.\r\n    * The `crypto` module:\r\n        * Implemented Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm that is used in Pku2u.\r\n        * Added `Checksum` trait and implement it for the `HmacSha196Aes128/256` and `HmacSha1Des3Kd`.\r\n        * Added the `Cipher::random_to_key` method that allows us to generate an encryption key from any input vector. For example, from DH shared secret. Not only from the password as it was before. Implement this method for all supported encryption types.\r\n\r\nUsed Docs & References:\r\n\r\n* [PKINIT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4556)\r\n*
