serialisation, and stop dependants from using internal-only interfaces. `HumanBinaryData` won't provide these interfaces, so it needs to make do.\r\n\r\n* Make `Base64UrlSafeData.0` (the inner `Vec<u8>`) private, like `HumanBinaryData`.\r\n\r\n  This switches over everything which used the inner field to using `From`, `Deref` or `::new()`. These interfaces are also available on `HumanBinaryData`, and makes the types pretty much interchangable.\r\n\r\n* Remove `impl Display for Base64UrlSafeData` (which converted the inner value into a Base64 string).\r\n\r\n  The alternative is to use `base64::Engine::encode`.\r\n\r\n* Remove `impl TryFrom<&str> for Base64UrlSafeData` (which attempted to parse strings as Base64).\r\n\r\n  The alternative is to use `base64::Engine::decode`.\r\n\r\n* Migrate `WinWrapper::new` to use owned types rather than pass-by-reference.\r\n\r\n  Most of the existing implementations made copies of that data, and callers don't need to clone anyway.\r\n\r\n- [ x ] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [ x ] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\n", "reactions":

policy](https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/blob/master/OpenSSL.md) is currently only \"enforced\" for `webauthn-authenticator-rs`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds OpenSSL version number checks to `attestation-ca` and `webauthn-rs-core` using `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`. Every other package in this repo with an OpenSSL dependency depends on one of these two packages, so can be handled transitively.\r\n\r\nThis will make builds fail with OpenSSL v1.x, in line with [our OpenSSL policy](https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/blob/master/OpenSSL.md).\r\n\r\n## OpenSSL alternatives\r\n\r\nWe don't currently support OpenSSL alternatives, but I've attempted to avoid breaking them with this PR:\r\n\r\n- [BoringSSL sets `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER` to whichever it's targetting](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/HEAD/PORTING.md), so doesn't need special casing.\r\n- [LibreSSL always reports as \"OpenSSL v2\"](https://man.openbsd.org/OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER.3) (which doesn't exist), so I've set that as the minimum. It probably has similar bugs, but `rust-openssl` doesn't expose the LibreSSL version, and LibreSSL doesn't target parity with specific OpenSSL versions.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested with either.\r\n\r\n## What failures look like\r\n\r\nWhen building with outdated OpenSSL, this PR now makes it so you get a build-time error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: failed to run custom build command for

examples (if relevant)\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements the basic `webauthn-rs` command line that I mentioned in the discussion of issue #397.  The idea is that this wrapper can be used for debugging and experimentation.  It can also be used to implement `webauthn` in programming languages other than Rust.  This is simplified by passing JSON to and from the command-line process rather than using a foreign function interface.\r\n\r\nIf you run `make` under `tutorial/server/cli/`, you'll see the result of running the command line for the two steps of passkey registration and the two steps of authentication.  It's modeled after the `tutorial/server/tide/` example.\r\n\r\nUsing this wrapper, I've implemented, in some code that is still private, a webauthn registration and login system in the programming language Scheme, with a Javascript front end.  I've tested it with both a Yubikey 5C key and a Pixel phone passkey.\r\n\r\nI've included minimal documentation in the comments, but I'm happy to add more if you think this pull request is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for making `webauthn-rs` available.  Without it, implementing `webauthn` for a Scheme front end would have been vastly more work.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/414/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/414/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/410/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410", "id": 2061919255, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85jBsoz", "number": 410, "title": "Add fake credential generator interfaces", "user": {"login": "Firstyear", "id": 271005, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271005?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear", "html_url": "https://github.com/Firstyear", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Firstyear/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2024-01-02T04:04:31Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T01:57:21Z", "closed_at": "2024-01-29T01:57:10Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/410", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/410.patch", "merged_at": "2024-01-29T01:57:10Z"}, "body": "Fixes #362 -

There's also no way to detect at a `build.rs` level whether a binary target will be used for a test, and conditionally disable elevation support.\r\n\r\nThere's no tests in `fido-key-manager` anyway \u2013 so this just disables them explicitly so that a project-wide `cargo test` won't fail on Windows.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/358/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/358/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/354/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354", "id": 1918508026, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85bfzd2", "number": 354, "title": "Add \"HumanBinaryData\" as an alternative to \"Base64UrlSafeData\"", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-09-29T02:30:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:18:42Z", "closed_at": "2023-10-02T23:18:42Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/354", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/354.patch", "merged_at": "2023-10-02T23:18:42Z"}, "body": "Related to issue #352, it **doesn't** fix things, but it's a start.\r\n\r\n`HumanBinaryData` uses a more efficient \"bytes\" format when using non-human-readable serialisation formats (like CBOR).  The deserialiser still uses `deserialize_any` \u2013 I haven't got a great way around this yet.\r\n\r\nI've done a few things differently to `Base64UrlSafeData`; for example, this doesn't implement `Display` or `FromStr` \u2013 they're different to what `Vec<u8>` does, and we should move away from this (this will be the focus of #356).\r\n\r\nIt also implements `Deref` and `DerefMut`, which should make the type more transparent \u2013 and all of the common impls are in macros.\r\n\r\nI've added `bytes` support to `Base64UrlSafeData`, so it can read what `HumanBinaryData` produces. Unfortunately this makes migration a two-step process.\r\n\r\nWhile we're here, this makes `serde_json` a dev-dependency of `base64urlsafedata`, because it's only used in tests; and this also adds a bunch more tests for expected input formats.\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Transport/Token API to be event based (#214), and in the process, replaces `hidapi` with a homebrew implementation. The branch is called `mozilla-hid` because my original plan was to base it on `authenticator-rs`, but in the end I've rewritten most of that.\r\n\r\nI'm only targetting Linux, macOS and Windows for now.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n* New USB HID API bindings (`fido-hid-rs`):\r\n  * on Linux, this uses udev and the kernel hidraw interface\r\n  * on macOS, this uses IOKit\r\n  * on Windows, this uses the UWP HID API (available on Windows 10 and later); `hidapi` and `authenticator-rs` used the older Windows 2000 APIs which are not async friendly\r\n\r\n* Add event-based API for device enumeration (`Transport::watch_tokens()`), moved Bluetooth and NFC transports to it.\r\n\r\n  This is now the only way to enumerate tokens for Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n* Started adding Bluetooth support to `fido-key-manager`. This is only really reliable on macOS at the moment.\r\n\r\n* NFC: work around a bug where macOS' login manager tries to access the PIV applet on tokens *that we have an exclusive connection to*, which causes some tokens to reset (if the command arrives after `SELECT FIDO` but before other commands).\r\n\r\n* Implement selection for CTAP 2.0/2.1-PRE authenticators\r\n\r\nTODO list:\r\n\r\n* [x] finish migrating fido-key-manager to the new API\r\n* [x] finish migrating examples to the new API\r\n* [x] consistently use tokio's threading/workers for USB backends rather than `std::thread`\r\n* [x] figure out if the platform-specific USB stuff needs to be its own crate to handle optional platform-specific dependencies\r\n* [x] clean up commented out code\r\n* [x] check Bluetooth device filtering works correctly on all platforms\r\n* [x] merge #328\r\n* [x] merge #329 \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n- [x] cargo test has been run and passes\r\n- [x] documentation has been updated with relevant examples (if relevant)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/324/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/324/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/418", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/418/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/418/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/418/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/418", "id": 2129297234, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCsX6y85ml0rb", "number": 418, "title": "Add build-time OpenSSL version checks", "user": {"login": "micolous", "id": 246847, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous", "html_url": "https://github.com/micolous", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/micolous/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-12T01:45:13Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-12T12:37:51Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-12T12:37:51Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pulls/418", "html_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/418", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/418.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/pull/418.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-12T12:37:51Z"}, "body": "[The `webauthn-rs` OpenSSL policy](https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/blob/master/OpenSSL.md) is currently only \"enforced\" for `webauthn-authenticator-rs`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds OpenSSL version number checks to `attestation-ca` and `webauthn-rs-core` using `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.
