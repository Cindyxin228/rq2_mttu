transitioning from `ArcRefCellWrapper` to `ArcMut`.\n\t- Updated multiple structs and methods to utilize `ArcMut`, improving concurrency and ownership management.\n  \n- **Bug Fixes**\n\t- No specific bug fixes were mentioned, but overall improvements in mutability may indirectly resolve concurrency-related issues.\n\n- **Documentation**\n\t- Updated comments to reflect changes in struct names related to `ArcMut` and `WeakArcMut`.\n\n- **Chores**\n\t- Removed obsolete `ArcRefCellWrapper` and `WeakCellWrapper` implementations from the codebase.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release
