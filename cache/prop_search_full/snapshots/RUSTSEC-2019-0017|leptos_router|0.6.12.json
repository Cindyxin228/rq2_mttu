convenient location for easy user discovery. \r\nBy having it be a separate directory we can exclude it from CI, and it won't have the same guarantees that the examples directory does. The project can aid in discovery of projects while distancing itself from the actual content, somewhat.\r\n\r\nIf people are storing lots of different Leptos projects here, and there aren't the same standards (which there probably shouldn't be to encourage lots of contributions), then individual contributors of those projects will have a lot of freedom to update these projects whenever they see fit which will hopefully translate into a lot of pull requests for people pushing code and taking responsibility for their own projects in the projects folder.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how fine-grained the merge approval process can get and if you can do it per-directory but I'd be happy to oversee the projects directory, maintain a list of which projects do what, and work with contributors to put their projects here and approve & merge pulls requests to the projects directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSam\r\n \r\n", "reactions": {"url":

expected. So I am not sure about some of the decisions I made.\r\n\r\n- Removed `separator(\"_\")` from the Environment source setup, because this is intended for nested structures.\r\n- Added  `convert_case(Case::Kebab)` to the Environment source setup to match the casing serde expects.\r\n- Removed `\"[leptos-options]\"` from toml string to let the settings be parsed as root level, otherwise the settings from the file and the ones set by the environment variables would be considered in different structures, therefore not affecting each other. Because of this `get_config_from_str()` now returns a `LeptosOptions` object instead of a `ConfFile`.\r\n\r\nThe test cases gave me some troubles as I had some inconsistent results. I assume (because tests are executed in parallel) that sometimes variables set in one test could interfere with a test that does not expect them (now that they could actually overwrite settings originated from a file source).\r\nI added `temp-env` as a dev dependency to address my issues. Afterwards the tests were working consistently again and I added a new test to explicitly test the override functionality.\r\n\r\nBecause I changed the parsing from `ConfFile` to `LeptosOptions`, I think the `serde::Deserialize` trait could actually be removed from the `ConfFile` struct.
