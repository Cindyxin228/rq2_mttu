improvements to speed up field mutation and `$0` reconstruction. \r\n\r\nOne of these improvements was to change `Buf::slice_to_str` to prefer `Shared` strings rather than `Inline` strings. For strings that are only read once or twice, the extra `memcpy` of reading into an Inline string ends up being too much overhead. This change generates single-percentage-point decreases in runtime for some aggregation-heavy benchmarks, but I think the overall win for output-heavy benchmarks is enough to keep the change.\r\n\r\nThe other impact of this change was to make reference counting for many more strings in frawk scripts nontrivial. This revealed two separate bugs in the llvm and cranelift backends: both were `ref`-ing strings and maps too often, leading simple scripts to hold onto the entire input in memory. This took a while to track down, but this bug does appear to be fixed in this change.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/issues/43/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/issues/43/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/issues/36", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/issues/36/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/issues/36/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/issues/36/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezrosent/frawk/pull/36", "id": 788542725, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU3MDM0OTEx", "number": 36, "title": "Cranelift Backend", "user": {"login": "ezrosent", "id": 3622899, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI4OTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3622899?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezrosent", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezrosent/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-01-18T20:57:08Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-27T18:54:22Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-18T21:06:25Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ezrosent/frawk/pulls/36", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezrosent/frawk/pull/36", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ezrosent/frawk/pull/36.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ezrosent/frawk/pull/36.patch", "merged_at": "2021-01-18T21:06:25Z"}, "body": "This change adds a frawk backend that JITs machine code using cranelift.
