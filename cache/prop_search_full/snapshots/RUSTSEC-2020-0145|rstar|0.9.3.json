1.51](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/03/25/Rust-1.51.0.html) has been released for nearly 12 months now.\r\n\r\nAs the community upgrades through and past this Rust version, some required dependencies of `rstar` (namely, `heapless` v0.6, which itself required the `as-slice` and `generic-array` dependencies before Rust 1.51) have since released updates to make use of the new Const Generics MVP functionality that was released with Rust 1.51.\r\n\r\nTo remove a few outdated dependencies and upgrade the codebase to the latest version of `heapless`, this PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgrades the `heapless` dependency from 0.6 to 0.7.\r\n\r\n  This broke my local compile, as `heapless`' signature for the `heapless::binary_heap::BinaryHeap` type changed, and the `heapless::consts::U32` can now be represented with a plain old `32_usize`. I made changes to `src/algorithm/nearest_neighbor.rs` to fix the compile, and this resolved the compile failure. The tests now seem to pass.\r\n  \r\n- Updates the CI workflows file to test versions as far back as Rust 1.51 (but not Rust 1.50), as well as two more recent MSRVs.\r\n\r\n- Updates the `rstar/Cargo.toml` file to specify a `rust-version` key to indicate that Rust 1.51 is the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV). This will display a warning on versions of cargo older than that which was distributed with Rust 1.56, as the `rust-version` key was added in that release.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/87/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/87/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/85", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/85/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/85/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/85/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/85", "id": 1110493702, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCXZfE84xYqCX", "number": 85, "title": "Remove pdqselect dependency", "user": {"login": "Stoeoef", "id": 5731969, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzE5Njk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5731969?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef", "html_url": "https://github.com/Stoeoef", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Stoeoef/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2022-01-21T13:51:48Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-21T15:39:52Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-21T15:39:52Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/pulls/85", "html_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/85", "diff_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/85.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/85.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-21T15:39:52Z"}, "body": "- [x] I agree to follow the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/georust/geo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [x] I added an entry to `rstar/CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users.\r\n---\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Fewer dependencies!\r\n- Switching to `select_unstable` (rather than `stable`) should be faster.

In the best case, we would haven an rstar implementation which can work without alloc - but my understanding of this implementation is rather limited. Currently, one needs to either pick the `std` or the alloc feature, picking none of them results in compilation failure. Maybe we can resort to `heapless::Vec` in the future, but this for sure requires further modifications.~~ This does not include any new features. Compilation is supported for both `std` and `no_std`, but the latter requires `alloc`. For validation, I did this:\r\n\r\n+ `cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf`\r\n+ `cargo build`\r\n+ `cargo build --release`\r\n+ `cargo test`\r\n+ `cargo test --release`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/83/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/83/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/78", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/78/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/78/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/78/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/78", "id": 1045059734, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCXZfE84uG76g", "number": 78, "title": "Release 0.9.2", "user": {"login": "rmanoka", "id": 5672629, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzI2Mjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5672629?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka", "html_url": "https://github.com/rmanoka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rmanoka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2021-11-04T18:17:15Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-16T16:11:13Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-18T16:32:58Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/pulls/78", "html_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/78", "diff_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/78.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/78.patch", "merged_at": "2021-11-18T16:32:58Z"}, "body": "- [x] I agree to follow the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/georust/geo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [ ] ~I added an entry to `rstar/CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users.~\r\n---\r\n\r\nPreparing for release 0.9.2.

1.51](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/03/25/Rust-1.51.0.html) has been released for nearly 12 months now.\r\n\r\nAs the community upgrades through and past this Rust version, some required dependencies of `rstar` (namely, `heapless` v0.6, which itself required the `as-slice` and `generic-array` dependencies before Rust 1.51) have since released updates to make use of the new Const Generics MVP functionality that was released with Rust 1.51.\r\n\r\nTo remove a few outdated dependencies and upgrade the codebase to the latest version of `heapless`, this PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgrades the `heapless` dependency from 0.6 to 0.7.\r\n\r\n  This broke my local compile, as `heapless`' signature for the `heapless::binary_heap::BinaryHeap` type changed, and the `heapless::consts::U32` can now be represented with a plain old `32_usize`. I made changes to `src/algorithm/nearest_neighbor.rs` to fix the compile, and this resolved the compile failure. The tests now seem to pass.\r\n  \r\n- Updates the CI workflows file to test versions as far back as Rust 1.51 (but not Rust 1.50), as well as two more recent MSRVs.\r\n\r\n- Updates the `rstar/Cargo.toml` file to specify a `rust-version` key to indicate that Rust 1.51 is the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV). This will display a warning on versions of cargo older than that which was distributed with Rust 1.56, as the `rust-version` key was added in that release.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/87/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/87/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, "chosen_detail": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/pulls/87", "id": 884210908, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCXZfE840s_zc", "html_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/87", "diff_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/87.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/georust/rstar/pull/87.patch", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/georust/rstar/issues/87", "number": 87, "state": "closed", "locked": false, "title": "Upgrade to heapless v0.7.10 and update MSRV to 1.51.0", "user": {"login": "rye", "id": 1566689, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjY2ODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1566689?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye", "html_url": "https://github.com/rye", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rye/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "body": "- [x] I agree to follow the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/georust/geo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [x] I added an entry to `rstar/CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users.\r\n---\r\n\r\n[Rust 1.51](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/03/25/Rust-1.51.0.html) has been released for nearly 12 months now.\r\n\r\nAs the community upgrades through and past this Rust version, some required dependencies of `rstar` (namely, `heapless` v0.6, which itself required the `as-slice` and `generic-array` dependencies before Rust 1.51) have since released updates to make use of the new Const Generics MVP functionality that was released with Rust 1.51.\r\n\r\nTo remove a few outdated dependencies and upgrade the codebase to the latest version of `heapless`, this PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgrades the `heapless` dependency from 0.6 to 0.7.\r\n\r\n  This broke my local compile, as `heapless`' signature for the `heapless::binary_heap::BinaryHeap` type changed, and the `heapless::consts::U32` can now be represented with a plain old `32_usize`.
