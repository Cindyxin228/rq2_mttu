example.\r\n\r\nThe examples are refactored a bit to become real crates: reason is that it needs to compile without the `testing` feature of `iroh-api`.  The examples feature from cargo enables that unfortunately.  I think for now this is fine, once the dev profile does no longer swap out the real Api struct they can become more normal examples.\r\n\r\nI'm particularly unhappy with the current way of configuring this - it's too easy to make mistakes.  There are a bunch of notes in the code still that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\n# Todo for this PR\r\n\r\n- [x] Default configuration should be isolated from system-installed iroh.\r\n- [x] Configuration without iroh-one's `Config` object.\r\n- [x] Explore splitting monolithic `Iroh` struct into separate `Store` and `P2p` nodes.\r\n\r\n# Out of scope for this PR\r\n\r\nBut needed in followup PRs.\r\n\r\n- HTTP & UDS Gateway.\r\n- Allow hooking up prometheus metrics.\r\n- Graceful shutdown instead of aborting tasks.\r\n- An in-memory store.", "reactions": {"url":
