This still requires a real HTTP client i.m.o. For this scenario, I want to hold off until the isahc upstream PR gets merged, as my experience with isahc has been very positive so far. However, to opt into using isahc, users need to enable the \u201cremote\u201d feature flag, which will only be used to connect to remote mock servers. As a consequence, functions like MockServer::connect, MockServer::connect_async, and MockServer::connect_env will only be available when the \u201cremote\u201d feature is turned on. \r\n\r\nThis
