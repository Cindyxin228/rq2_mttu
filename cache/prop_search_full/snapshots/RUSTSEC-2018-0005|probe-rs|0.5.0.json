draft of how I imagine hwo we could do this.\r\nPlease add your ideas and hints, I'll gladly incooperate them.\r\n\r\nI suggest a config file structure like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$HOME/.config/probe-rs\r\n    - repositories.yaml\r\n    - repositories\r\n        - foo\r\n            - svd\r\n                - chip_name.svd\r\n            - algorithms\r\n                - algorithm_name.yaml\r\n            - targets\r\n                - chip_name.yaml\r\n            - .git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `chip_name.yaml` contains a chip definition which links to an algorithm (by name).\r\nIt also contains a list of chip variants which all describe their memory layout.\r\n\r\nThe target can be selected with cargo-flash via `cargo flash --target target_name::variant_name` or `cargo flash --target target_name` which will select the first best variant it can find for the target.\r\n\r\nTo update the repositories we provide a command in cargo-flash too. Which will pull in the repository contents via the git URL provided in the `repositories.yaml`.\r\n\r\nTo not depend on a server, we ship a binary blob with a select set of sanitized configs, which will be placed in the probe.rs config dir at first run.\r\n\r\nTo extract the target descriptions we provide a tool too, which can parse the packs and generate the configs.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should also not leave the algorithms separate as it just makes config management harder.\r\nSo we would just have the target configs.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm for target selection I imagine is:\r\n- Parse all the target configs from the repositories.\r\n- The ones with higher priorities overwrite the ones with lower priorities (I would take the order of the repository urls).\r\n- The user can directly provide a config file via `--config` (or similar) which always wins in priority.\r\n- The parsed targets are inserted into a list/hashmap from which the target then is selected by name.\r\n\r\nI hope this covers it pretty well.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/probe-rs/probe-rs/issues/86/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":

a custom set of registers. For more information see: https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.nrf52832.ps.v1.1%2Fdif.html&anchor=debugandtrace\r\n\r\nI don't see a reason why this wouldn't work for st-link, but it doesn't. It's only working with dap-link. This is kinda weird, because when the chip isn't locked I can use st-link to successfully communicate with AP#1 and send an erase (unlock) command with no problem, and it works, I know that because the flash gets indeed erased. However, when the chip is locked the stlink only gets the `0x05` error (`JtagNoDeviceConnected`) when communicating with the CTRL-AP, while the dap-link works without a problem.\r\n\r\nI tried several init configurations for the st-link without success. I also tried using the `STLink::open_ap` method, which lacks documentation and is never used, so I'm not sure when to use it.", "reactions": {"url":
