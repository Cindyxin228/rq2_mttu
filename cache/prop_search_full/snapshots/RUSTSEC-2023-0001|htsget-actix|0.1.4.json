`htsget-search` and `htsget-http`.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n* Use generic types in `http-tests` to avoid using the structs in `htsget-search` and `htsget-http`.\r\n* Specify expected responses using `serde_json` [`Value`](https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/value/enum.Value.html). This also probably makes the tests more robust as they no longer dependent on the implementation of the `htsget-http` structs.\r\n* Move `CertificateKeyPair` to config to avoid repeating the logic in `htsget-tests` and simplifying logic in `htsget-search`. This is a breaking change as it removes the `TryFrom<DataServerConfig> for HttpTicketFormatter` implementation.
