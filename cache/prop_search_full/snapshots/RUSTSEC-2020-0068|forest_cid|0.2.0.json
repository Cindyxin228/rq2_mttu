to be overriden for the forseeable future is the verifier, and not worth the overhead to refactor the vm to allow for interior mutability of the state tree\r\n\r\nOne thing that I didn't change yet

introduced in this pull request:\r\n- In the go-actors implementation, they serialize/deserialize an unchecked utf8 string for their `DealProposal`. Although it is unused, we need to be able to (de)serialize the bytes as a string.\r\n  - This isn't as simple as just manually reading bytes for this structure, because of how Serde is architected. Since the deserialization goes through the serde_cbor deserializer and strings are automatically checked, this is impossible without replacing serde altogether for serialization (which isn't feasible right now)\r\n  - Commit on serde_cbor fork used: https://github.com/ChainSafe/cbor/commit/3e7bf81f57e9010762dbc12292bd6f927fdfe83a\r\n  - This should be safe for us, because this is the only string that is Cbor serialized and it isn't used by the protocol at all (unless they plan to use in v2) but the negative is that it potentially allows non utf8 strings to be deserialized in the future.\r\n  - Issue in specs-actors https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/issues/1248\r\n- Unskips the utf8 failing tests (as well as others that weren't updated) and is now 522/592\r\n\r\nThis should absolutely be a temporary solution, and be removed after this bug is removed from the protocol.\r\n\r\nThe benefit to the fork, however, is that we can add the serialization length limits that they do in the go implementation (and therefore part of the spec)\r\n\r\nThere is an alternative to this that I was considering, which is on deserialization if the bytes are not utf8, deserialize the data as bytes instead. This is also a simple solution but to me seemed to give unintended side effects and also requires a custom type and deserialization to unsafely convert the bytes to str before serializing. Technically this way is more safe, because no non utf8 bytes are left as string outside of serialization, but is logically confusing and inconsistent.\r\n\r\n**Reference issue to close (if

The benefit to doing this way is we don't have to deal with the performance regression outside of VM where the blockstore reads/writes diff cannot cause a consensus issue.\r\n\r\n**Reference issue to close (if applicable)**\r\n<!-- Include the issue reference this pull request is connected to -->\r\n<!--(e.g. Closes #1)-->\r\nCloses #729 \r\n\r\n\r\n**Other information and links**\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you \ud83d\udd25 -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/731/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/730", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/730/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/730/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/730/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/730", "id": 715190236, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk4MTQxMzM5", "number": 730, "title": "Add caching to Hamt and update testing", "user": {"login": "austinabell", "id": 24993711, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTkzNzEx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24993711?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell", "html_url": "https://github.com/austinabell", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austinabell/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2287459767, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg3NDU5NzY3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/labels/Interop", "name": "Interop", "color": "e99695", "default": false, "description": "Interop with Lotus/specs-actors and testing"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-10-05T21:59:05Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-06T12:12:22Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-06T12:12:20Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/pulls/730", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/730", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/730.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/730.patch", "merged_at": "2020-10-06T12:12:20Z"}, "body": "**Summary of changes**\r\nChanges introduced in this pull request:\r\n- Adds cache to Hamt, similar to one added with #716 \r\n- Removes murmur3 support\r\n  -

Negative to this is that it opens up a possibility of calling a function with a full and mock verifier, and they could theoretically disagree on state because the full verifier can fail where the mock verifier would succeed. This can always change when #713 is implemented (and our strategy of swapping this out is clear)\r\n\r\n> Why was the default proof verification removed from `Syscalls` trait?\r\n\r\nDidn't want to add the generic bound on the trait, as only the `DefaultSyscalls` type has the option of using the generic. Also because the logic was moved into the `ProofVerifier` trait.\r\n\r\n> Why were the `state_manager::utils` functions changed to implementation of `StateManager`?\r\n\r\nIdk, why was it setup the way it was in the first place? Got very verbose quick with introducing the extra generic.\r\n\r\n> Why do the RPC functions that use the VM default to `FullVerifier` implementation?\r\n\r\nThe mechanism for swapping verifier implementation at runtime isn't decided, and didn't want to add another generic bound to the RPC state when the node also defaults to `FullVerifier`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reference issue to close (if applicable)**\r\n<!-- Include the issue reference this pull request is connected to -->\r\n<!--(e.g. Closes #1)-->\r\nCloses #712 \r\n\r\n\r\n**Other information and links**\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you \ud83d\udd25 -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/726/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/726/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/724", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/724/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/724/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/issues/724/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/724", "id": 712378704, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk1ODcyMTA2", "number": 724, "title": "BlockSync provider", "user": {"login": "snaumov", "id": 5119578, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTk1Nzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5119578?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov", "html_url": "https://github.com/snaumov", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/snaumov/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1701597940, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzAxNTk3OTQw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/labels/Network", "name": "Network", "color": "7b79f7", "default": false, "description": "Libp2p and PubSub stuff"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-10-01T00:24:56Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-08T11:38:47Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-08T11:38:47Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChainSafe/forest/pulls/724", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/724", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/724.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/724.patch", "merged_at": "2020-10-08T11:38:46Z"}, "body": "**Summary of changes**\r\nChanges introduced in this pull request:\r\n- \r\n\r\nBlockSync \"provider\" - the logic to run for an incoming `BlockSync` libp2p request.\r\n\r\n**Test notes**\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat hard to test this MR.

resolution of Cid link if it's cached to avoid duplication (necessary for interop)\r\n  - Removed `Clone` requirement by allowing a ref to the cache to be returned for loaded subnodes\r\n- Adds tests for serialization and blockstore stats\r\n  - Cids are all the same, just made them string format to remove need for hex encoding\r\n  - Our impl performs less writes on expansion, because go implementation flushes unnecessarily (will follow up but added TODOs)\r\n- Adds `TrackingBlockStore` which allows stats for reads and writes to be used to compare against Lotus (gas usage is based on this, so will be useful for Hamt as well which is why it's in a shared location)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reference issue to close (if applicable)**\r\n<!-- Include the issue reference this pull request is

Moved `ElectionProof` to blocks crate as logic was not tied to crypto functions and want to keep crypto crate as small as possible\r\n  - Also implementing computing win count, which is the inverse of logic done in reward actor (but with different precision and other slight differences which is why it may seem like some duplication with the params, also to avoid circular dep)\r\n- Makes ticket optional in block header\r\n  - This was always a pointer in go impl, so not sure if they did to heap allocate or if we just haven't hit the case where their is nil yet\r\n\r\nWhat left unfinished (I will create issues for):\r\n- Updating `verify_winning_post_proof`: there is conflicts with miner actor PR, and the changes should be focused on in their own changes as it's very specific integration with proofs\r\n- Allowing for insecure post validation (optional, but will most likely be helpful when debugging)\r\n\r\n**Reference issue to close (if applicable)**\r\n<!-- Include the issue

quick responses to send blocksync requests to when syncing while also keeping the set of top peers randomized to reduce chance of responses coming from the same peer.\r\n- Refactors peer manager usage\r\n  - Now peer manager is part of the `SyncNetworkContext` to allow the peer retrieval and logging to be done within the shared logic instead of having duplications.\r\n  - Remove other duplicated logic when constructing the `BlockSyncRequest` and handling the response.\r\n  - Consolidates logic so that changes do not have to be made in multiple places for updates, and cleans up code

tipset vector fails because blocked on miner actor impl as mentioned, but seems like that is only discrepancy, so should be fine to pull in and if any other difference it can be debugged
