Use \\[`local_cache_once!`] as appropriate.\n-   When requested, the `FromForm` implementations of `Vec` and `Map`s are now properly lenient.\n-   To concord with browsers, the `[` and `]` characters are now accepted in URI paths.\n-   The `[` and `]` characters are no longer encoded by \\[`uri!`].\n-   [`Rocket::launch()`][Rocket::launch()] allows `Rocket` recovery by returning the instance after shutdown.\n-   `ErrorKind::Runtime` was removed; [`ErrorKind::Shutdown`][ErrorKind::Shutdown] was added.\n\n#### General Improvements\n\n-   \\[`Rocket`] is now `#[must_use]`.\n-   Support for HTTP/2 can be disabled by disabling the default `http2` crate feature.\n-   Added [`rocket::execute()`][rocket::execute()] for executing Rocket's `launch()` future.\n-   Added the \\[`context!`] macro to \\[`rocket_dyn_templates`] for ad-hoc template contexts.\n-   The `time` crate is re-exported from the crate root.\n-   The `FromForm`, `Responder`, and `UriDisplay` derives now fully support generics.\n-   Added helper functions to `serde` submodules.\n-   The \\[`Shield`] HSTS preload header now includes `includeSubdomains`.\n-   Logging ignores `write!` errors if `stdout` disappears, preventing panics.\n-   Added [`Client::terminate()`][Client::terminate()] to run graceful shutdown in testing.\n-   Shutdown now terminates the `async` runtime, never the process.\n\n##### HTTP\n\n-   Introduced \\[`Host`] and the \\[`&Host`] request guard.\n-   Added `Markdown` (`text/markdown`) as a known media type.\n-   Added \\[`RawStr::percent_encode_bytes()`].\n-   `NODELAY` is now enabled on all connections by default.\n-   The TLS implementation handles handshakes off the main task, improving DoS resistance.\n\n##### Request\n\n-   Added \\[`Request::host()`] to retrieve the client-requested host.\n\n##### Trait Implementations\n\n-   `Arc<T>`, `Box<T>` where `T: Responder` now implement `Responder`.\n-   \\[`Method`] implements `Serialize` and `Deserialize`.\n-   \\[`MediaType`] and \\[`ContentType`] implement `Eq`.\n\n##### Updated Dependencies\n\n-   The `time` dependency was updated to `0.3`.\n-   The `handlebars` dependency was updated to `4.0`.\n-   The `memcache` dependency was updated to `0.16`.\n-   The `rustls` dependency was updated to `0.20`.\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\n-   Rocket now uses the 2021 edition of Rust.\n\n[`(ContentType, T)`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/response/content/index.html#usage\n\n[v0.4 to v0.5 migration guide]: https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/upgrading-from-0.4/\n\n[FAQ]: https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/faq/\n\n[`Rocket::launch()`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/struct.Rocket.html#method.launch\n\n[`ErrorKind::Shutdown`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/error/enum.ErrorKind.html#variant.Shutdown\n\n[shutdown fairings]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/fairing/trait.Fairing.html#shutdown\n\n[`Client::terminate()`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/local/blocking/struct.Client.html#method.terminate\n\n[`rocket::execute()`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/fn.execute.html\n\n[`CookieJar::get_pending()`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/http/struct.CookieJar.html#method.get_pending\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
