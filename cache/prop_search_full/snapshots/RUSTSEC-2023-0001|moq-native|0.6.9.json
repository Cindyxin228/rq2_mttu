0.17.12 (2025-03-05)</h1>\n<p>Bug fix: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/2447\">briansmith/ring#2447</a> for denial of service (DoS).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic in <code>ring::aead::quic::HeaderProtectionKey::new_mask()</code> when\ninteger overflow checking is enabled. In the QUIC protocol, an attacker can\ninduce this panic by sending a specially-crafted packet. Even unintentionally\nit is likely to occur in 1 out of every 2**32 packets sent and/or received.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic on 64-bit targets in <code>ring::aead::{AES_128_GCM, AES_256_GCM}</code>\nwhen overflow checking is enabled, when encrypting/decrypting approximately\n68,719,476,700 bytes (about 64 gigabytes) of data in a single chunk. Protocols\nlike TLS and SSH are not affected by this because those protocols break large\namounts of data into small chunks. Similarly, most applications will not\nattempt to encrypt/decrypt 64GB of data in one chunk.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overflow checking is not enabled in release mode by default, but\n<code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C overflow-checks&quot;</code> or <code>overflow-checks = true</code> in the Cargo.toml\nprofile can override this. Overflow checking is usually enabled by default in\ndebug mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/commits\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=ring&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.17.11&new-version=0.17.12)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
