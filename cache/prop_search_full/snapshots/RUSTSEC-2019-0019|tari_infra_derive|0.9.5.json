The delays can result in the server sending a response before the deadline and the client receiving the response after the deadline + grace period - so I've increased the grace period. IMO we need to look at how we can reduce data transmission, possible prime targets are UTXO sync and reducing the data usage of DHT network discovery (less peers transferred, less often, optimal set reconciliation etc). Other potential optimisations may exist in the noise protocol implementation and yamux.\r\n\r\n**Stress tests observations**\r\n\r\n- Streaming ~100Mb over a local connection, the server can take many seconds (1s-15s) to transmit the data when with some contention. There is nothing unexpected about this, however I set a 4 second timeout with 200ms grace period and some contention over the socket, and so was seeing timeouts that I erroneously did not expect.\r\n- ~~Reliability and performance appears better with many small messages than with fewer large payloads~~ \r\n- Performance is many times better in release mode, this is most likely because of the cryptography used in stream cipher of the noise protocol\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunning 1 test\r\n'quick' is running...\r\n'quick' completed in 0.01s\r\n'basic' is running...\r\n'basic' completed in 0.27s\r\n'many_small_messages' is running...\r\n'many_small_messages' completed in 1.69s\r\n'few_large_messages' is running...\r\n'few_large_messages' completed in 0.63s\r\n'payload_limit' is running...\r\n'payload_limit' completed in 3.15s\r\n'high_contention' is running...\r\n'high_contention' completed in 25.45s\r\n'high_concurrency' is running...\r\n'high_concurrency' completed in 41.70s\r\n'high_contention_high_concurrency' is running...\r\n'high_contention_high_concurrency' completed in 82.73s\r\ntest run ... ok\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nStress tests test noise protocol + muxer + rpc performance\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n* [x] I'm merging against the `development` branch.\r\n* [x] I have squashed my commits into a single commit.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3208/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3208/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3203", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3203/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3203/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3203/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3203", "id": 972540693, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzE0MTE5MjUw", "number": 3203, "title": "Expose `get_mempool_stats` via gRPC and add cucumber test", "user": {"login": "philipr-za", "id": 25514413, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTE0NDEz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25514413?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za", "html_url": "https://github.com/philipr-za", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-08-17T10:32:41Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-18T12:03:26Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-18T12:03:26Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/pulls/3203", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3203", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3203.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3203.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-18T12:03:26Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\nThis PR exposes the `get_mempool_stats` method via the base node gRPC interface.

This turned out to be during the send_transaction calls which did the initial transaction setup synchronously, this involves selecting UTXOs and building the initial transaction which with a large UTXO database can take time.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce this impact the `handle_request(\u2026)`  function is changed in the transaction service. Instead of calling that function, waiting for a synchronous response and then sending the response down the reply one shot channel the one-shot channel is passed into the `handle_request(\u2026)` function. For the send_transaction case the intensive work is then moved into the asynchronous `transaction_send_protocol` task and the reply channel is also sent into that task. The task is spawned and runs asynchronously when the `handle_request` method can end and return to the select! loop. Once the task has completed the initial tranasction setup it can send the response to the service API caller via the reply channel.\r\n\r\nThis is only implemented in the asynchronous way for `send_transaction` in this PR, all the other API requests will still do their work synchronously and send the response over the reply channel but the infrastructure is now there to convert any one of those API calls to reply asynchronously if needed. At the moment the other API requests don\u2019t appear to take long enough to require this effort just yet.\r\n\r\n`transaction_sender_protocols` are indexed by their TxId so in order to start the task with the ID before building the initial transaction the tx_id is now generated in the Transaction Service. The Transaction Protocol builder is updated to allow an optional manual specification of the TxId.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n* [ ] I'm merging against the `development` branch.\r\n* [ ] I have squashed my commits into a single commit.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3194/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3194/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3192", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3192/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3192/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3192/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3192", "id": 970201069, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzEyMTg1NDU4", "number": 3192, "title": "Remove old unused integration tests", "user": {"login": "SWvheerden", "id": 2579813, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzk4MTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2579813?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden", "html_url": "https://github.com/SWvheerden", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SWvheerden/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-08-13T08:56:19Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-17T11:56:05Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-17T09:21:57Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/pulls/3192", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3192", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3192.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3192.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-17T09:21:57Z"}, "body": "<!--- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis PR removes a bunch of old unused integration tests. \r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

These are for example functions such as `spend_utxo` previously they were all exposed but they are now all internal LMDB functions and we only have access to functions such as add_block which will internally \"spend\" the utxos.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n* [x] I'm merging against the `development` branch.\r\n* [x] I have squashed my commits into a single commit.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3192/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3192/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3188", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3188/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3188/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/3188/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3188", "id": 968479122, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzEwNTkxNDY1", "number": 3188, "title": "Remove `test_harness` feature from wallet", "user": {"login": "philipr-za", "id": 25514413, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTE0NDEz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25514413?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za", "html_url": "https://github.com/philipr-za", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipr-za/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-08-12T09:51:24Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-18T11:31:54Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-18T11:31:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/pulls/3188", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3188", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3188.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/3188.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-18T11:31:54Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\nIn the early days of wallet development we didn\u2019t have a working base nodes or cucumber infrastructure for the Mobile Clients to be able to test transacting.
