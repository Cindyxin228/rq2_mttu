Now backends are expected to\r\nprovide publishing and consuming together at the same time.\r\n\r\nMost of this code is adapted from the private crate standard-hedwig,\r\nwhich has been a proving ground for the publishing API before it could\r\nbe incorporated into this open-source crate, and has seen effective\r\noperation in production.\r\n\r\n~There are still some changes to follow in later commits to finalize the\r\nAPI before publishing as a major release, as noted in some of the source\r\ncomments.

"merged_at": "2020-09-22T10:37:31Z"}, "body": "This commit refactors this library, almost from scratch, in order to:\r\n\r\n1. Achieve more conventional and easier-to-use APIs;\r\n2. More correct and flexible error handling;\r\n3. Internal segmentation of batches inside of google publisher.\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation was originally 3, but then old way of implicit\r\nerror handling came up as a problem as well. I attempted to introduce\r\nsome mechanism to handle errors in a more granular way without adjusting\r\nAPI of the library too much, but it turned out to be not very feasible.\r\n\r\nThe new API is centered around the new `hedwig::Message` trait which the\r\nusers would implement to associate data types with various information\r\nthat is necessary for the hewdig library \u2013 the topic name, the\r\nvalidators applicable to the data, the encoding mechanisms, etc.\r\nFurthermore, it now allows retaining all of auxiliary data alongside the\r\nmessage data as well, giving further flexibility in how this library is\r\nused by the users.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the trait was designed in a way that would allow to move the\r\nmessage-encoding specific pieces of code away from the business logic as\r\nmuch as possible. For now the implementation of this trait remains\r\nmanual, but there is nothing that would prevent it from being\r\n`derive`able in some way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe error handling was made entirely explicit in the new API. In\r\nparticular we no longer implicitly re-queue messages in the batch (nor\r\ndo we reuse the batches, anymore). Instead the users receive a `Stream`\r\nof `(result, topic, validated message)`. They can then choose to `push`\r\nthe validated message back into a new batch they are constructing to\r\nretry the message\u2026 or just handle the error in whatever other way that\r\nmakes sense to them.\r\n\r\nOne important improvement as part of this change is simplification of\r\nbehaviour when the futures/streams are cancelled. Previously dropping\r\nthe `publish` future would leave one in a fairly difficult to understand\r\nstate where the batch might have some of the messages re-queued and some\r\nof them cancelled, etc.\r\n\r\nSince there's no longer any state remaining in `hedwig`, dropping\r\nstreams to cancel starts making significantly more sense as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGoogle PubSub has various limitations on the API requests that are made\r\nto its endpoints. As we are in charge of batching the requests up to\r\nimplement publishing more efficiently, it is also up to us to ensure\r\nthat we do not exceed any of the limits upstream has placed on us.\r\n\r\nTo do this we implement a batch segmentation algorithm in\r\n`GoogleMessageSegmenter` that the GooglePubSubPublisher uses internally\r\nto split up the messages.\r\n\r\nFixes #18",

Make publishing async. This necessitated dropping use of the generated google API libraries, which I think is perfectly fine given the super tiny amount of API surface that we interface with;\r\n2. Make library more resilient to failure. A most notable instance of this is the `PublishBatch` not discarding messages that failed to publish for whatever reason. Instead those messages are retained and can be retried with a repeated call to `publish`;\r\n3. I also made the library assume less about how people might want to use this. A good example of this is `GooglePubSubPublisher` accepting an arbitrary `oauth2` authenticator (so that different strategies could be chosen by the user; previously we supported service accounts only).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/issues/12/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/issues/12/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/issues/34", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/issues/34/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/issues/34/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/issues/34/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/pull/34", "id": 1025810219, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC4xXPM4tLB2D", "number": 34, "title": "Refactor Publishing", "user": {"login": "rnarubin", "id": 4503172, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDMxNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4503172?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin", "html_url": "https://github.com/rnarubin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "rnarubin", "id": 4503172, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDMxNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4503172?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin", "html_url": "https://github.com/rnarubin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "rnarubin", "id": 4503172, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDMxNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4503172?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin", "html_url": "https://github.com/rnarubin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnarubin/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-10-14T00:29:09Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-27T20:07:19Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-27T20:07:19Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/pulls/34", "html_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/pull/34", "diff_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/pull/34.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/standard-ai/hedwig-rust/pull/34.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-27T20:07:19Z"}, "body": "This changeset completely refactors publishing to be based on async\r\nSinks, and to port the googlepubsub publisher to use gRPC instead of the\r\nJSON REST api.
