latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n\n*Sourced from [regex's changelog](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*\n\n> 1.3.1 (2019-09-04)\n> ==================\n> This is a maintenance release with no changes in order to try to work-around\n> a [docs.rs/Cargo issue](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/issues/400).\n> \n> \n> 1.3.0 (2019-09-03)\n> ==================\n> This release adds a plethora of new crate features that permit users of regex\n> to shrink its size considerably, in exchange for giving up either functionality\n> (such as Unicode support) or runtime performance. When all such features are\n> disabled, the dependency tree for `regex` shrinks to exactly 1 crate\n> (`regex-syntax`). More information about the new crate features can be\n> [found in the docs](https://docs.rs/regex/*/#crate-features).\n> \n> Note that while this is a new minor version release, the minimum supported\n> Rust version for this crate remains at `1.28.0`.\n> \n> New features:\n> \n> * [FEATURE [#474](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/474)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/474):\n>   The `use_std` feature has been deprecated in favor of the `std` feature.\n>   The `use_std` feature will be removed in regex 2. Until then, `use_std` will\n>   remain as an alias for the `std` feature.\n> * [FEATURE [#583](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/583)](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/583):\n>   Add a substantial number of crate features shrinking `regex`.\n> \n> \n> 1.2.1 (2019-08-03)\n> ==================\n> This release does a bit of house cleaning. Namely:\n> \n> * This repository is now using rustfmt.\n> * License headers have been removed from all files, in following suit with the\n>   Rust project.\n> * Teddy has been removed from the `regex` crate, and is now part of the\n>   `aho-corasick` crate.\n>   [See `aho-corasick`'s new `packed` sub-module for details](https://docs.rs/aho-corasick/0.7.6/aho_corasick/packed/index.html).\n> * The `utf8-ranges` crate has been deprecated, with its functionality moving\n>   into the\n>   [`utf8` sub-module of `regex-syntax`](https://docs.rs/regex-syntax/0.6.11/regex_syntax/utf8/index.html).\n> * The `ucd-util` dependency has been dropped, in favor of implementing what\n>   little we need inside of `regex-syntax` itself.\n> \n> In general, this is part of an ongoing (long term) effort to make optimizations\n> in the regex engine easier to reason about. The current code is too convoluted\n> and thus it is very easy to introduce new bugs. This simplification effort is\n> the primary motivation behind re-working the `aho-corasick` crate to not only\n> bundle algorithms like Teddy, but to also provide regex-like match semantics\n> automatically.\n></tr></table> ...
