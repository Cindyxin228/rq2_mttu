private discovery messages to wallets because\r\nthey do not have the `MESSAGE_PROPAGATION` feature.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behaviour of the DHT to include wallets in\r\ndiscovery propagation messages. Internally, the Forward step of the DHT pipeline \r\nhas a special case that will propagate discovery messages to wallets. The closest peer selection \r\nhas been adjusted to allow the caller to specify the PeerFeatures of the closest nodes to target by using the `neighbours_with_features` call.\r\n_NOTE:_ because those nodes will not propagate the message further, the selection ensures \r\nthat a minimum number of propagation nodes are always selected   \r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a new example called \"memorynet\". `memorynet`, as\r\nthe name suggests, is a small in-memory DHT network consisting of a\r\nnumber of \"base nodes\" and \"wallets\" (all that differs is their feature\r\nflags).\r\n\r\nThe following happens when running `memorynet`:\r\n1. A single \"seed node\", `NUM_NODES` \"base nodes\" and `NUM_WALLETS` \"wallets\" are generated and started.\r\n1. All \"base nodes\" join the network via the \"seed node\"\r\n1. All \"wallets\" join the network via a random \"base node\"\r\n1. The first \"wallet\" in the list attempts to discover the last \"wallet\" in the list\r\n1. The result of the discovery is printed and the network is shut down\r\n\r\nThe example can be run with this command:\r\n`RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --example memorynet 2> /tmp/debug.log`\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\n\r\nCloses #1204 \r\n\r\nThe _memorynet_ example provides clean and easy to read output that allows you to easily see what is happening between a network of nodes. Each generated node is assigned a name that is used in stdout output. Normal internal logs are logged to stderr and can be switched on using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nBringing up virtual network consisting of a seed node, 15 nodes and 2 wallets\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNode 'Bob' is joining the network via the seed node 'Alice'\r\nEVENT: 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)' connected to 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)'\r\nEVENT: 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)' got inbound connection from 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)'\r\n\r\nNode 'Carol' is joining the network via the seed node 'Alice'\r\nEVENT: 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)' connected to 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)'\r\nEVENT: 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)' got inbound connection from 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)'\r\n\r\nNode 'Charlie' is joining the network via the seed node 'Alice'\r\nEVENT: 'Charlie (d4eaac42550edbd9)' connected to 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)'\r\nEVENT: 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)' got inbound connection from 'Charlie (d4eaac42550edbd9)'\r\nEVENT: 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)' connected to 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)'\r\nEVENT: 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)' got inbound connection from 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)'\r\n(snip...)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nDiscovery is done.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude0e 'Vanna' discovered peer 'Plod (7bb7b1d55953e391)' ([7bb7b1d55953e391] PK=88aed2306b39d4c4659b6a41d98199c5a8acb48155ba1e2fa6c356edece7c251 Features=NONE | COMMUNICATION_CLIENT) in 11014ms\r\n(snip...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n_memorynet_ is the primary test of these changes.
