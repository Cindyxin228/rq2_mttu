Enhancements:\r\n\r\n - Store and handle samples as 32-bit floats instead of 16-bit integers. This provides 24-25 bits of transparency, allowing for 48-54 dB of headroom to do volume control and normalisation without throwing away bits or dropping dynamic range below 96 dB CD quality.\r\n\r\n - Perform volume control and normalisation in 64-bit arithmetic for minimum quantisation noise.\r\n \r\n - Output to 32-bit float, 32-bit integer, 24-bit integer (both in padded 32-bit words and as three-byte arrays) or 16-bit integer (default), as specified on the command line.\r\n\r\n - Add a dynamic limiter with configurable threshold, attack time, release or decay time, and steepness for the sigmoid transfer function. This mimics the native Spotify limiter, offering greater dynamic range than the old limiter, that just reduced overall gain to prevent clipping.\r\n\r\n - Make the configurable threshold also apply to the old limiter, which is still available.\r\n\r\n - DRY-ups of a lot of audio backend code, at the same time enabling `OggData` passthrough on the subprocess backend.\r\n\r\nResolves: #608\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n\r\n - New command line options: \r\n```\r\n        --format FORMAT Output format (F32, S32, S24, S24_3 or S16). Defaults to S16\r\n        --normalisation-method NORMALISATION_METHOD\r\n                        Specify the normalisation method to use - [basic,\r\n                        dynamic]. Default is dynamic.\r\n        --normalisation-threshold THRESHOLD\r\n                        Threshold (dBFS) to prevent clipping. Default is -1.0.\r\n        --normalisation-attack ATTACK\r\n                        Attack time (ms) in which the dynamic limiter is\r\n                        reducing gain. Default is 5.\r\n        --normalisation-release RELEASE\r\n                        Release or decay time (ms) in which the dynamic\r\n                        limiter is restoring gain. Default is 100.\r\n        --normalisation-knee KNEE\r\n                        Knee steepness of the dynamic limiter. Default is 1.0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n - For the dynamic limiter, steepness between 0.5 and 2.0 work well. The default of 1.0 yields a linear function; > 1.0 rolls off softly, is steeper midway and < 1.0 has a sharp initial response, then gentler midway. Feedback on optimisation of these parameters is welcome.\r\n\r\n - Compiling `with-vorbis` works, but panics. This was already the case and is not new to this PR. See: https://github.com/tomaka/vorbis-rs/issues/19\r\n\r\n### To do:\r\n\r\n - [x] Add a command-line option to output either 16 or 32 bit depth\r\n - [x] Add support for four-byte S24 output format\r\n - [x] Add support for three-byte S24_3 output format\r\n - [x] Rename `normalisation-steepness` to `normalisation-knee`\r\n - [x] Revert default format to S16 for a seamless out-of-the-box experience\r\n - [x] Test remaining backends (help needed!)\r\n - [x] Optimise requantizer to work in `f32` then round\r\n\r\nPending refactoring:\r\n - [x] ~~DRY up sample conversion in PortAudio and SDL backends~~\r\n_Edit: Not much to be gained, dropped idea_\r\n - [x] ~~Use `TryFrom` idiom instead of `AudioPacket::f32_to_<type>()` helper functions~~\r\n_Edit: Moved sample conversion into separate struct_\r\n - [x] Use `Self` instead of full struct and enum names on `config.rs`\r\n\r\nAll done!\r\n\r\n### Test status:\r\n\r\nAll backends compile successfully, but require testing.\r\n\r\nBackend | Status | First verified by | Remarks\r\n------- | ------ | ----------- | ------\r\nAlsa | :white_check_mark: | @roderickvd | -\r\nGStreamer | :white_check_mark: | @JasonLG1979 |\r\nJACK audio | \u2705 | @sashahilton00 |\r\npipe | :white_check_mark: | @roderickvd | -\r\nPortAudio | :ballot_box_with_check: | @roderickvd | [2]\r\nPulseAudio | :white_check_mark: | @JasonLG1979 | -\r\nRodio | :ballot_box_with_check: | @roderickvd | [1]\r\nSDL | | | [3]\r\nsubprocess | :white_check_mark: | @roderickvd | -\r\n\r\n 1.

(Nevertheless, dev and this branch are further diverging, merging will get harder. I hope there aren't too many other PRs in preparation.)\r\n\r\nHere are a few things worth noting:\r\n* Reverted #548 to make merging easier. After merging I reimplemented the functionality, but a little easier and with less code duplication.\r\n* I hope you're fine with using tokio's channels instead of futures' channels. I had the impression that the tokio channels were created with some of the drawbacks of futures' channels in mind.\r\n* Move the get_credentials function as I suggested in #596.\r\n* Remove `LinearMap` dependency and simply use `HashMap`. It wasn't clear why it was used at all, but it could be reverted if you know the reason.\r\n* Update the url dependency (#368)\r\n* Remove default impl for `SessionConfig` (it wasn't used, but needed the uuid dependency for librespot-core)\r\n* #566 used the slightly outdated `error-chain`, I replaced it by `thiserror`.\r\n\r\nPS: [Compare changes except merging](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/compare/678d177...Johannesd3:tokio-migration-refactor-deps)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/649/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/649/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647", "id": 814243633, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc4MjYzODM3", "number": 647, "title": "Set MSRV to 1.41", "user": {"login": "Johannesd3", "id": 51954457, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTU0NDU3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51954457?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3", "html_url": "https://github.com/Johannesd3", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-02-23T08:39:55Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-23T18:50:36Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-23T18:05:10Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/pulls/647", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647", "diff_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-23T18:05:10Z"}, "body": "Attempts to restore the MSRV to 1.41 which is the rustc version in stable Debian.

fixes two bugs in the playback crate (well, I also introduced them). \r\n\r\nSecondly, `RodioSink` was modified such that it implements `Send` now. The solution spawns an own thread to create the `rodio::OutputStream`. When `RodioSink` is dropped, this thread is notified via a channel and the `OutputStream` is dropped as well. So `RodioSink` doesn't carry the `OutputStream` anymore and is now `Send`. \r\n\r\nI also used this occasion to improve the error handling in the `RodioSink` using `thiserror`, but this should only be the beginning.\r\n\r\nIf it's ok, I will continue with those relatively small PRs for the tokio migration, so it's easier to follow what I'm doing and easier to contribute.", "reactions": {"url":

This addresses the licensing issue mentioned in issue #539 with respect to this dependency.\r\n - Rewrites the PulseAudio backend code to use the higher-level `libpulse-binding` and `libpulse-simple-binding` crates (v2.13+), rather than the raw 'sys' layer crates, resulting in significant simplification.\r\n\r\nYou may want to consider bumping the dependency of the sys layer to v1.12+ (via v2.15+ of the bindings) which implemented use of `pkg-config`.\r\n\r\nOne detail of the last commit that's slightly uglier than I'd like is how the `Option<String>` device name attribute is used for the `Option<&str>` param.

https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/issues/28\r\n\r\nThanks to the gapless playback enhancements, this is working much better than it did in December. I also recently got rid of all my warnings and did a rustfmt. \r\n\r\nOne current bug is that the apparent playback position in the Spotify GUI is very slightly (about 1 second) ahead of the actual position of the song as you're hearing it out of your headphones. It's much, _much_ better with the gapless fixes from kaymes, but still slightly behind. This is because the appsrc has a 4k buffer, and some of the other pipeline elements (audio sinks, for example) also have buffers. Without a little bit of pipeline buffering it would be very choppy.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't think this backend works particularly well with the assumptions of \"gapless mode disabled.\" It works fine for gapless-enabled though.\r\n\r\nI also need to document this backend on the wiki under Audio_Backends, but I don't want to add docs for something that won't be merged, so I'll add that afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing for newbies to understand will be how to write a correct `device` argument for gstreamer. This is only necessary if the user wants something other than the audio going directly to the `autoaudiosink` (a gstreamer-determined \"sane default\" for audio playback based on the user's system), but there are quite some valid use cases for wanting something different (network streaming over rtp or something to a \"smart speaker,\" for instance.)\r\n\r\nI'm still sort of a rust newbie, so I will work on improving my branch if this isn't up to snuff yet.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/456/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0,

I analysed why librespot is slow when loading files and wrote up my findings in issue #306. Back then, I also started work on a new mechanism to download the files. Unfortunately, I got busy and forgot about it and never submitted it despite it being almost finished. Until today.\r\n\r\nHere is my work on a new downloading strategy for librespot.\r\n\r\nThe idea is, that it uses dynamic block sizes. That is, blocks are small while seeking and during initial play and grow for downloading the grunt of the file. Also, while seeking in a file, it only downloads the requested blocks whereas while streaming, it reads ahead until the entire file is downloaded and placed in the cache.\r\n\r\nI also implemented some heuristics based on the observed round-trip (ping) times to determine how much to buffer before playback.\r\n\r\nPlease test this version of the code.\r\n\r\nThe thing I'm most worried about is the possibility of not buffering enough because I can't exhaustively test this. This must be tested with different internet connections. If you notice the playback starting and then there's a short pause after which it resumes (a buffer under run), then the ping-time-buffer-heuristic must be adapted.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/393/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/393/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}], "chosen_pr": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/674", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/674/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/674/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/674/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/674", "id": 834161626, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTk1MDM3NTUy", "number": 674, "title": "[Tokio migration] Add back hyper-proxy", "user": {"login": "Johannesd3", "id": 51954457, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTU0NDU3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51954457?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3", "html_url": "https://github.com/Johannesd3", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-03-17T20:41:08Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-29T19:05:15Z", "closed_at": "2021-03-29T19:00:19Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/pulls/674", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/674", "diff_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/674.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/674.patch", "merged_at": "2021-03-29T19:00:19Z"}, "body": "This PR adds back the latest version of hyper-proxy.
