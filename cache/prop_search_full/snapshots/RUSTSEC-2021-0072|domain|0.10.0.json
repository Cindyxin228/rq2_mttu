`net::server` module to `domain` that enables the creation of UDP and TCP DNS servers using base transport server, middelware and service building blocks.\r\n\r\nFor examples of the code in use see:\r\n- RustDoc tests.\r\n- [`examples/server-transports.rs`](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/blob/serve-poc/examples/server-transports.rs) - if you run this it prints various suggested `dig` commands you can run to see it in action.\r\n- The Stelline test [`net-server.rs`](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/blob/serve-poc/tests/net-server.rs).\r\n\r\nVarious things could be improved even without review feedback:\r\n- [x] The `examples/serve.rs` is not neat and tidy at all and should maybe be split into multiple examples. - _Resolution: Tidied up a bit._\r\n- [x] I'm not sure if the `net::server::prelude` is a good idea or not. - _Resolution: Removed._\r\n- [ ] The code doesn't currently adhere completely to our desired coding guidelines.\r\n- [x] The tests in `net::server::tests` haven't been looked at for a long time. - _Resolution: Reviewed, added some comments, did some minor cleanup._\r\n- [x] The skeleton for dynamic reconfiguration support is present but not yet used. - _Resolution: It is now used._\r\n- [x] The EDNS(0) timeout support might have the wrong idea about what EDNS(0) timeouts are, I haven't looked back at that for a long time. - _Resolution: This has been checked and updated._\r\n- [x] The TODOs present in the code should be revisited. - _Resolution: Many TODOs have been resolved, some have been deliberately left behind as they require more thought._\r\n- [x] No bechmarking / performance testing has been done yet. - _Resolution: Localhost testing with `dnsperf` and the 1M query set has been done yielding ~1.5M query/sec on the test machine for both UDP and TCP. This was done using the zone tree support in PR #286._\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't have the discussed zonefile support yet. - _Resolution: See PR #286._\r\n- [x] Review remaining calls to `unwrap()` - _Resolution: Unwraps removed, explained with SAFETY comment, or converted to expect() if truly fatal._\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces tokio-tracing for async friendly context aware logging, e.g. one can capture the dns message id high up in a call tree and have it automatically included in a log message from deep in the call tree which I think is potentially very useful.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also probably incompatible with `--no-default-features` as that would disable the `std` feature yet this PR currently uses `std` functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it's a good moment to take a look at it as-is.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/issues/274/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/issues/274/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/issues/272", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/issues/272/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/issues/272/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/issues/272/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/272", "id": 2132486723, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCK2NOs5mwtiO", "number": 272, "title": "Fix TXT record serialization.", "user": {"login": "partim", "id": 1318494, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg0OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1318494?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim", "html_url": "https://github.com/partim", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-13T14:41:48Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-18T11:44:16Z", "closed_at": "2024-03-18T11:44:11Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/domain/pulls/272", "html_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/272", "diff_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/272.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain/pull/272.patch", "merged_at": "2024-03-18T11:44:11Z"}, "body": "This PR fixes TXT record data serialization for human-readable formats.

These are mostly the same except that they facilitate Generic Associated Types as stabilized in Rust 1.65. This results in subtly changed trait bounds, though mostly these should be invisible to the user.\r\n\r\nOne notable change is that `octseq` makes the error type of the `OctetsBuilder` generic and uses `Infallible` for those types where appending data will never fail (which, for most users, is all of them). It provides methods for either case and we are mirroring these in `domain`. While this means that converting you code to using the PR will require some work, that work should mostly be removing unwraps \u2013 which is nice.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re using the opportunity to clean up a few more things that have crept into the code over time. A list of which will be added here:\r\n\r\n*  The range, slice, and split methods on the domain name types have changed. They have been merge into a single method taking ranges \u2013 except for those on `Dname` that require type changes. The split methods now take references and don\u2019t change `self` anymore. This is somewhat required by the limitations imposed by the new `Octets` trait but feels better, anyway.\r\n\r\n* The `Parse`, `Compose`, and `Scan` traits have been demoted to mere extension traits for foreign types (primarily the built-in integers, so that you can do things like `u16::parse`). All other types now simply have methods matching the patterns. Where generics are necessary, dedicated traits have been added. E.g., there now are `ParseRecordData` and `ComposeRecordData` traits that are implemented by all record data types.\r\n\r\n* Composing of record data and options has been switched to a scheme where the size is predetermined whenever possible instead of composing the data and then updating the length after. Since this is not possible for record data that uses compressed names when compression is actually in use, the old scheme is still used in this particular case.", "reactions": {"url":
