Cargo needs to respect that to prevent clients from breaking.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/alexcrichton/jobserver-rs/pull/49\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\n1. Get a GNU Make 4.4 binary.\r\n2. Change lines like [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/524231f43f602a553216548a81e4ae22be8dd905/tests/testsuite/jobserver.rs#L66) pointing to your binary. \r\n    For example, on macOS I changed to `gmake` to invoke GNU Make from homebrew.\r\n3. Run `cargo t --test testsuite jobserver::`\r\n\r\nIf you want to test this patch live, you can also execute `cargo build` from `make -j2` to test the behaviour.\r\n(I usually run [`procs -w rustc`](https://github.com/dalance/procs) to observe the amount of rustc invocations.)\r\n\r\n```makefile\r\n# Makefile\r\nall:\r\n\t+./target/debug/cargo build --release\r\nclean:\r\n\tcargo clean --release\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFallback workaround: add `--jobserver-style=pipe` if you are using GNU Make 4.4 and this PR has yet got landed.\r\n\r\nSome distros that already got GNU Make 4.4:\r\n\r\n- Fedora 38: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/make/c/715e733cee430436b250af7d1e32d72fb7dfc8b6?branch=f38\r\n- openSUSE Tumbleweed: https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1032805\r\n- Arch Linux, Manjaro: https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/commit/9448ab762d966b18025ec55f0a4239cbe6de8b0f\r\n- Alpine Linux (edge): https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/commit/main?id=9852cb19b76057ec5216f238ffbf5ff8d5de010f\r\n- KaOS: https://github.com/KaOSx/core/commit/6b2939d51145fd0ca6660894b5820af5ed3b6e30\r\n\r\n<!-- homu-ignore:end -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11767/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11767/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11760", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11760/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11760/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11760/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11760", "id": 1597229597, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAQnScc5KoE9S", "number": 11760, "title": " [beta-1.68] backport #11759", "user": {"login": "weihanglo", "id": 14314532, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE0NTMy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14314532?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo", "html_url": "https://github.com/weihanglo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/weihanglo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1261897039, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjYxODk3MDM5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.

This can lead to users [working around the problem which could accidentally slip in](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commit/d92d04840c1fb518faf8f964054b48f64e4920db).\r\n\r\n### How should we test and review this PR?\r\n\r\nThe first round for this PR includes a warning in the `cargo` crate to ensure it breaks CI.
