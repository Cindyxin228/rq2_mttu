We can't currently stop services on the legacy runtime, since we can't actually drop the legacy runtime. I implemented a stop method for it before discovering it was not possible, I left it there but with a comment. I'm happy to replace it with a `todo!()` if that's more tidy for now. \r\n\r\nI implemented stop for wasm serenity and axum, which is tested (manually) and works. We may want to setup integration tests for these runtimes with some helpers for the grpc requests, but maybe in a separate PR?\r\n\r\nI opted for `oneshot` channels that are set on each `start`, but on second thought it may have been a mistake. I suppose the runtime should be able to load -> start several services, keeping them all alive until their ID/name receives a stop request. Meaning `broadcast` channels may be the correct choice here.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR also changes the Dockerfile to install a newer protoc binary directly, rather than with `apt`, to allow us to use explicit optional fields in the protobufs. This is also done for the CI.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/481/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,
