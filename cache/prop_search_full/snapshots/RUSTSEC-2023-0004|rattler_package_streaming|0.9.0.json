"2023-09-07T09:21:10Z"}, "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nPR that makes the Rust libsolv solver generic on a couple of traits and the current conda ecosystem uses these traits. The traits you currently need are:\r\n\r\n* `VersionTrait` defines what a version specification is. We might be able to get rid of some requirements on this later. For Conda this is a `PackageRecord`.\r\n* `VersionSet` this is the set of version which you can use to match something that implements `VersionTrait`.\r\n* `DependencyProvider` this has a function that determines how candidates selected by the solver should be ordered. This is custom per ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe reason for doing this is to be able to integrate other ecosystems like `PyPi` into the solver and see if this can work. We now know the generic requirements currently needed by the solver.\r\n\r\nAll the conda specific code has been moved to `rattler_solve`. I think if all tests succeed this is in state that it could potentially be merged.  All the tests are succeeding locally so I suppose the whole thing should be a drop in replacement.\r\n\r\nIt does have a performance regression, namely that we are copying a lot of PackageRecords. Regression range from `13% - 77%` depending on the test,  so that's quite a lot. However, I think it would be good to review and merge before it gets bigger :) Then look at `PackageRecord` improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the solver tests I've made a bespoke version and matching spec that could potentially be a source of inspiration for an implementation.\r\n\r\n# Todo's in code\r\n\r\nSome TODO's have been added to the code where we could potentially improve some aspects.\r\nSome notable todo's:\r\n * The sorting method in conda requires a cache of candidates to highest versions, could we potentially make this more generic? Maybe even a generic caching crate like `lru` would just work.\r\n * There is a `Name` type in the `VersionTrait` that might be able to move to `Pool`\r\n * In the libsolv tests, I've made generic methods for adding packages and dependecies in the Pool, this puts some more requirements on the `Traits` of pulling these requirements into the `traits`. This goes against the last point, however. And we should see what we prefer. It's also totally possible to keep these methods ecosystem specific, with some potential duplication.\r\n * Can we avoid NewTypes somehow when implementing the traits in `rattler_solve` or is this something we actually want? :)\r\n * Can we make the arguments to `sort_candidates` type-safe as of now they can can by any `SolvableId` it would be nice to be able to actually use the subset returned by the pool when matching on the name. Could introduce a new type for this that can only be constructed in such a situation.\r\n\r\n# What's next?\r\n\r\n* [ ] Making use of the `&PackageRecord` type instead of the `PackageRecord` value, avoiding copies. \r\n* [ ] Try writing the same for PyPi and see what we still need to change, while keeping the solver code generic.", "reactions": {"url":

It refactors the parsing of versions to use `nom` instead of the code that was ported from conda. \r\n\r\nUsing `nom` allows removing some obscure regexes and should make it easier to integrate the same parsing logic in other places like the MatchSpec and VersionSpec parsing logic which are up next for a refactor.\r\n\r\nThe parser is about 3x faster in the common case and 2x faster in more complex cases.\r\n\r\nWith the new parser, I was also able to extract more information from the string which makes it possible to reproduce the exact string representation it was created from (with some obscure exceptions). Because of that, I was able to remove the \"normalized\" string representation from the struct further reducing the size from 128 to 112 bytes. \r\n\r\nAs you review this PR you will notice that some version string representations have changed. This is because the string representation is now constructed from the version itself. However, some cases are very hard to reproduce, for instance, the number `06` is represented as `6` in our code. While reviewing, make sure you check these changes and decide if they make sense or not.\r\n\r\nThis code again makes use of some bit twiddling to achieve all this but I wrapped all this behavior into structs to make it simple to reason about (see `Segment` and `Flags`).\r\n\r\nThings that currently fail to parse but did previously parse correctly are: \r\n\r\n- [x] `1__` parsed as `1._`\r\n- [x] `1--` parsed as `1._`\r\n\r\nI will look into those!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/conda/rattler/issues/240/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
