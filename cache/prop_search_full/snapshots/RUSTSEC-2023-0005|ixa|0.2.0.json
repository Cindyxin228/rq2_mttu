(What about `ExecutionPhase::Normal`?)\r\n\r\n- The \"next\" command that takes a time has been renamed to \"breakpoint\", and a new \"next\" command was created. In other words: `breakpoint 1.2`\u00a0sets a breakpoint at time `1.2`, while `next`\u00a0executes the next thing.\r\n\r\n- Method `schedule_debugger()` is now implemented directly on `Context`, because the data member `breakpoints_scheduled` is in `Context`. There is now no need for `ContextDebuggerExt`\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVanity changes:\r\n\r\n- Format times to 6 decimal places when printed in debugger, trace statements. I think I should also strip trailing zeros past the decimal point.\r\n- Added a \"halt\" debugger command (Related: #244 )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm happy with this implementation.
