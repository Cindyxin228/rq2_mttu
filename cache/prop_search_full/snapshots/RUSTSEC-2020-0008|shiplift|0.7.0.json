RPM from such a binary leads to problems, as the RPM will try to \"depend\" on the vendored shared object, which will not be resolvable from the repo).\r\n\r\n~This change enables the `vendored` feature only on windows builds, and reverts to the default behaviour (searching for a system-wide version using pkg-config if present) on other systems (mac, linux...)~\r\n\r\n~I considered an alternative option, that of exposing~ This PR exposes a `vendored-ssl` feature that enables the `openssl/vendored` feature, which can be enabled if desired by builds, this makes windows builds a little harder, as they probably have to enable the feature.\r\n\r\n## How did you verify your change:\r\n\r\n(cross) Compiled for linux and windows.\r\n\r\n## What (if anything) would need to be
