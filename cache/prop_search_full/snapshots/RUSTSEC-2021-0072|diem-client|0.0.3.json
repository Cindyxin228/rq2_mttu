boilerplate and producing more readable specs.\r\n\r\nThe tool is currently in a very early stage and does only one thing:\r\nfor each `aborts_if` in a function spec, test whether it is redundant.\r\nIt achieves this by removing the `aborts_if` and check whether the function spec can still be proved.\r\n\r\nMore functionalities will be added to the tool later, such as\r\n- spec unrolling\r\n- spec simplification\r\n\r\nTo run the tool:\r\n```bash\r\ncd language/move-prover/tools/spec-flatten\r\ncargo run -- ../../../diem-framework/core/sources/AccountCreationScripts.move -d ../../../diem-framework/core/sources -d ../../../move-stdlib/sources\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpect results like:\r\n```\r\nfun AccountCreationScripts::create_child_vasp_account\r\n  Number of aborts_if

This also adds support for admin scripts.\r\n\r\nNow if you try to send a regular transaction script:\r\n```\r\n//# run --signers 0x4777eb94491650dd3f095ce6f778acb6\r\n//#     --private-key 56a26140eb233750cd14fb168c3eb4bd0782b099cde626ec8aff7f3cceb6364f\r\nscript {\r\n    fun main() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe test harness will panic:\r\n```\r\nthread 'run_test::diem_test_harness/example.move' panicked at 'Transactions scripts are not currently allowed on Diem.

Specifically, it stubs out the logic required for the remaining API calls (`get_transaction_outputs_with_proof()` and `get_account_states_chunk_with_proof()`) and adds support for fetching relevant metadata regarding these calls. With this PR, we now have a skeleton for the server side of the storage service that can be filled in to provide all the data we need for state sync v2.\r\n\r\nThe PR offers the following commits:\r\n1. Add a skeleton for the `get_transaction_outputs_with_proof()` API call. For now, the API call will return an error as we're waiting for `TransactionOutputs` to be supported by the DB.\r\n2. Add a skeleton for the `get_account_states_chunk_with_proof()` API call. This requires introducing a new type `AccountStatesChunkWithProof` that will be implemented/completed in a follow up PR. For now, the API call will return an error.\r\n3. Expand the storage server summary to include information about the transactions, epochs, transaction outputs and account states chunks held by the server. For now, we *naively* assume all nodes hold all of this data up to the version they are currently synced to, however, we'll need change this in the future once the DB supports relevant calls to fetch this information.\r\n\r\n### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/diem/diem/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n## Test

server-side implementation for the Storage Service. The Storage Service is an inter-node service allowing Diem nodes to request storage data (e.g., transactions and proofs) directly from other nodes over the Diem network. This PR sets up the framework (template) for this service by implementing the plumbing between request/response processing from the server-side, as well as outlines the required interface between the server and local Diem DB. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the PR offers 2 commits:\r\n1. Add the new server implementation (as a library to later be exposed over the network)\r\n2. Add several (simple) tests for the server implementation.

The benefits of this change include: (i) better encapsulation between the service and subscribers, e.g., we don't leak so many implementation details; (ii) reconfiguration subscribers are now automatically subscribed to all configs, simplifying the code -- note there was a bug with mempool in regards to this, i.e., it was expecting to listen to something that it never subscribed to (!); (iii) subscribers can actively now listen to events; and (iv) all of the messy code is now simplified and located in one place \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the PR offers 5 commits:\r\n1. Update mempool to listen to the `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n2. Update consensus to listen to the `EventSubscriptionService`. \r\n3. Update network to listen to the `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n4. Update state sync to drive the `EventSubscriptionService`.\r\n5. Remove the old `SubscriptionService`.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I'm not proud of how I managed to hook up the network builder (i.e., in commit 3), but it seems to be okay.

While I'm generally reluctant of adding new crate dependencies to code, the claim crate provides much nicer error messages on assertion failures and avoids situations where assertion failures produce unhelpful outputs (e.g., see here: https://github.com/diem/diem/issues/9062). Instead, using claim, we now get error messages like:\r\n\r\nFailure on `assert_matches!`:\r\n```\r\nthread 'coordinator::tests::test_new_and_lost_peers' panicked at 'assertion failed, expression does not match any of the given variants.\r\n    expression: Ok(())\r\n    variants: Err(Error::InvalidStateSyncPeer(..))', state-sync/state-sync-v1/src/coordinator.rs:1978:9\r\n```\r\n\r\nFailure on `assert_ok!`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'tests::test_missing_configs' panicked at 'assertion failed, expected Ok(..), got Err(CannotSubscribeToZeroEventKeys)', state-sync/inter-component/event-notifications/src/tests.rs:398:5\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, using the crate has: (i) made the tests more readable (i.e., it allows the reader to better distinguish between general unwraps/expects and the assertions the test cares about); and (ii) reduced the lines of code (e.g., due to having native support for things like `assert_matches`). Finally, we note that this dependency is test-only.\r\n\r\nThe PR offers the following commits:\r\n1. Adopt claim for consensus notifications\r\n2. Adopt claim for mempool notifications\r\n3. Adopt claim for state sync\r\n4.
