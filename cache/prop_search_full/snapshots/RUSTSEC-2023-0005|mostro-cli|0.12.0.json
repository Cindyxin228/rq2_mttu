reminder:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRemove of `nip59.rs` mod\r\n\r\ntesting to replace lot of lines of code with internal Sdk functions:\r\n\r\n- Added a cleaner way to fetch events removing old code to do that.\r\n- Tested a full cycle of sell order with new nip59 functions directly from sdk with success.\r\n- Need to understand if we can manage also user messages in similar way.\r\n\r\nTemporary note: \r\n\r\nAt the moment to make this compile we need to point to Nost-sdk in `cargo.toml` of `mostro-cli` and `mostro-core` like this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nnostr-sdk = { git  = \"https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr\", features = [\"nip06\", \"nip44\", \"nip59\"], rev =\"70db575d51965240aab1e1b3f1edab782c0ef625\"}\r\n```\r\nand also use a local override of `mostro-core` to point to same nostr-sdk like, this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\nmostro-core = { path = \"../mostro-core\" }\r\n```\r\nthese 2 patches can be removed as soon as new release of sdk has been shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by
