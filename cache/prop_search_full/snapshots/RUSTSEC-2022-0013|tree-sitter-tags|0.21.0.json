href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/WASI-some-possible-changes.md\">wasmtime's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Possible changes</h1>\n<p>The following are a list of relatively straightforward changes\nto WASI core that should be considered.</p>\n<h2>Split file/networking/random/clock from args/environ/exit.</h2>\n<p>Currently everything is mixed together in one big &quot;core&quot; module. But we can\nsplit them out to allow minimal configurations that don't support this style\nof files and networking.</p>\n<h2>Move higher-level and unused errno codes out of the core API.</h2>\n<p>The core API currently defines errno codes such as <code>EDOM</code> which are\nnot used for anything. POSIX requires them to be defined, however\nthat can be done in the higher-level libraries, rather than in the\nWASI core API itself.</p>\n<h2>Detecting EOF from read/recv explicitly.</h2>\n<p>POSIX's <code>read</code> returns 0 if and only if it reaches the end of a file or stream.</p>\n<p>Say you have a read buffer of 1024 bytes, and are reading a file that happens\nto be 7 bytes long. The first <code>read</code> call will return 7, but unless you happen\nto know how big the file is supposed to be, you can't distinguish between\nthat being all there is, and <code>read</code> getting interrupted and returning less\ndata than you requested.</p>\n<p>Many applications today do an extra <code>read</code> when they encounter the end of a\nfile, to ensure that they get a <code>read</code> that returns 0 bytes read, to confirm\nthat they've reached the end of the file. If <code>read</code> instead had a way to\nindicate that it had reached the end, this extra call wouldn't be necessary.</p>\n<p>And, <code>read</code> on a socket is almost equivalent to <code>recv</code> with no flags -- except for\none surprising special case: on a datagram socket, if there's a zero-length\ndatagram, <code>read</code> can't consume it, while <code>recv</code> can. This is because <code>read</code> can't\nindicate that it successfully read 0 bytes, because it has overloaded the meaning\nof 0 to indicate eof-of-file.</p>\n<p>So, it would be tidier from multiple perspectives if <code>read</code> could indicate\nthat it had reached the end of a file or stream, independently of how many\nbytes it has read.</p>\n<h2>Merging read and recv</h2>\n<p>These are very similar, and differ only in subtle ways. It'd make the API\neasier to understand if they were unified.</p>\n<h2>Trap instead of returning EFAULT</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

without deriving clone unnecessarily, that was a bad mistake I made there but I did that to spark the conversation as to why that might be, I wasn't 100% sure back then.\r\n\r\nI think testing grammars that parse large repos will benefit immensely anyways from having a `-j` flag that tells the cli how many threads to run parsing on, it does help a lot when it's in the order of magnitude of minutes. This is the first step in getting that potentially done, but is also great in that it fixes the spurious racy CI failures which happen when one test compiles a parser and the other attempts to load it when it's partially been written to the fs.\r\n\r\nfs4 also seems to be actively maintained, unlike the fs2 crate in the previous PR", "reactions": {"url":

Those parsers can then be used in the web browser, via [`web-tree-sitter`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/lib/binding_web), the WASM build of the Tree-sitter library. Now, they can *also* be used by the native Tree-sitter library, if the new [wasm feature](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/1864) is enabled.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've found so far, when [building WASM modules as dynamic libraries](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/blob/main/DynamicLinking.md) with Clang/Emscripten, those dynamic libraries cannot include functions from the C/C++ standard library that they depend on. Instead, the \"main module\" needs to explicitly include any standard library functions that we plan to use.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have manually included a somewhat arbitrary list of functions from the C standard library, as well as a few from libc++ (`new`, `delete`, plus some `std::string` ones), but grammar authors have not had any visibility into what functions are available, or even the fact that there *is* a limited set of functions. Also, the list of stdlib symbols has been specified in a number of duplicated places, so there wasn't one clear place to change the list of symbols (in case we want to add any, or if we bump Emscripten and the C++ ABI changes).\r\n\r\n### Change\r\n\r\nThis change consolidates all of the logic for deciding which standard library functions to include into one file, [`stdlib-symbols.txt`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/compare/wasm-stdlib?expand=1#diff-cfe0f1ea249c6a20143752f357f11f72c60f28b1e8839d4c496789d324ad06f0). That file is used for:\r\n* The `web-tree-sitter` library\r\n* The native Tree-sitter library, when the WASM feature is enabled\r\n* A Rust library function, `wasm_stdlib_symbols`\r\n* A new step in the `build-wasm` CLI command, which checks that the WASM artifact doesn't depend on any unavailable symbols.\r\n\r\nNow, when you run `tree-sitter build-wasm` in a grammar repo, it will give you an informative error message if you depend on a function that's unavailable.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\nAs I work on [language extensions in zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/7096), I'll be building a list of community parsers that we want to use via WASM. I may end up adding some new stdlib functions to the available set. Now, there is a single place where they need to be added.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/2897/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
