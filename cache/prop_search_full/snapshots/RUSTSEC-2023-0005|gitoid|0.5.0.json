from one designed to fit the largest\r\npossible hash algorithm _supported_ by the crate regardless of the\r\nactual hash algorithm used in a specific case, to one that is sized\r\nto have exactly the space needed for the selected hash algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis involves a little bit more complexity than I'd like, because Rust's\r\nconst-generics support is still incomplete and thus this crate\r\nrelies on the `generic_array` crate to provide what we need. In the\r\nfuture we'd replace this with normal const-generic arrays which\r\nwould (hopefully) also simplify the bounds on the generic types.\r\n\r\nThis commit does not complete the work for this transition, as it\r\ndoes not address fixing the FFI story. The FFI module is commented\r\nout, and will need to be updated before this can be merged.\r\n\r\nThis commit _does_ remove the finder API. After consideration,\r\nI think the current API for finding matching GitOids is both too\r\ncomplicated in terms of trait bounds AND under-powered in terms\r\nof controlling matching behavior. It may not even make sense to\r\nproscribe _how_ matching can be performed on a scale beyond\r\n\"check object against GitOid\" given the complexities of performance\r\ntuning which are possible.\r\n\r\nA fun note on sizing, in the prior code the size of a GitOid was fairly\r\nlarge, as the GitOid type had to store two 4 byte enums (HashAlgorithm\r\nand ObjectType) plus a \"usize\" (usually 4 bytes), and a 32-byte buffer.\r\nSo it would generally be 52 bytes.\r\n\r\nIn the new code, for SHA-256, GitOids are 33 bytes (1 byte for the\r\nObjectType, and 32 bytes for the buffer), and for SHA-1 GitOids are\r\n21 bytes (1 byte for the ObjectType, 20 bytes for the buffer). Given that\r\nwe expect code using GitOids in OmniBOR to be using large numbers of\r\nthem, this size saving is great news!\r\n\r\nFixes #82.", "reactions": {"url":
