actually depend on the `futures` crate\r\nfor the types `Context`, `Poll`, `AsyncRead` (simply called `Read` in\r\n`async-std`), `Stream`, and `StreamExt`. It instead relies on the\r\nversions of `Context` and `Poll` from the Rust standard library, which\r\nit re-exports, and provides its own definition of the `Read`, `Stream`,\r\nand `StreamExt` traits. For this reason users of the\r\n`signal-hook-async-std` crate are unlikely to depend on the `futures`\r\ncrate themselves, making this crate's dependency on `futures`\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces these types with the versions from `async-std` and\r\nremoves the `futures` dependency from the `signal-hook-async-std` crate.\r\n\r\nIn another project I am working on that uses `signal-hook` and\r\n`async-std`, this change removed the following 10 crates from my\r\ndependency list:\r\n\r\n- futures\r\n- futures-executor\r\n- futures-macro\r\n- futures-sink\r\n- futures-task\r\n- futures-util\r\n- pin-project\r\n- pin-project-internal\r\n- proc-macro-hack\r\n- proc-macro-nested", "reactions": {"url":
