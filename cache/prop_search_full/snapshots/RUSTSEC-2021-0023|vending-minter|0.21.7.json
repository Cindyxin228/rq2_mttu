Setup minter has two implementations, 1) vending minter and 2) base minter. These two setups share a lot of the same code but use some different pieces where a simple code fork would make it too complex. \r\n2)   The main motivation of the test-suite is so that a vending-minter or base-minter with collection could easily be setup. With the help of /common_setup/templates.rs we can now do this in just four lines: \r\n```rs\r\n    let vt = vending_minter_template(4);\r\n    let (mut router, creator, buyer) = (vt.router, vt.creator, vt.buyer);\r\n    let minter_addr = vt.collection_response_vec[0].minter.clone().unwrap();\r\n    let collection_addr = vt.collection_response_vec[0].collection.clone().unwrap();\r\n```\r\nIf we want to get base minter instead we can do something similar: \r\n```rs\r\n    let bmt = base_minter_with_sg721(1);\r\n    let (mut router, creator, buyer) = (bmt.router, bmt.creator, bmt.buyer);\r\n    let minter_addr = bmt.collection_response_vec[0].minter.clone().unwrap();\r\n    let collection_addr = bmt.collection_response_vec[0].collection.clone().unwrap();\r\n```\r\n3) The /common_setup/templates.rs provides pre-written setups of commonly used minter and collection configurations. If you want something that is not provided, you can just write another function that does the additional setup you need. \r\n\r\n4) For minter setups that don't fit in nicely with the templates approach, you have the ability to specify parameters directly. The function to call is `configure_base_minter` with a proper set of `collection_params` and `minter_params`. Here is an example: \r\n```rs\r\n    let mut router = custom_mock_app();\r\n    let (creator, buyer) = setup_accounts(&mut router);\r\n    let start_time = Timestamp::from_nanos(GENESIS_MINT_START_TIME);\r\n    let collection_params = mock_collection_params_1(Some(start_time));\r\n    let minter_params = minter_params_token(num_tokens);\r\n    let code_ids = base_minter_sg721_nt_code_ids(&mut router);\r\n    let minter_collection_response = configure_base_minter(\r\n        &mut router,\r\n        creator.clone(),\r\n        vec![collection_params],\r\n        vec![minter_params],\r\n        code_ids,\r\n    );\r\n ```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/486/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/486/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/483", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/483/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/483/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/483/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483", "id": 1498755293, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG4vgis5FkCvv", "number": 483, "title": "Move sg-eth-airdrop and vending minter tests into testing-suite", "user": {"login": "humanalgorithm", "id": 32441941, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQxOTQx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32441941?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm", "html_url": "https://github.com/humanalgorithm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-12-15T16:39:06Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-22T00:50:05Z", "closed_at": "2022-12-22T00:50:02Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/pulls/483", "html_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483", "diff_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483.patch", "merged_at": "2022-12-22T00:50:02Z"}, "body": "PART 2\r\nThere are 3 PRs in this series: \r\n1) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/479  => Refactors the vending minter tests that will serve as the common core for other similar tests\r\n2) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483  => Create the test-suite folder where all tests will eventually go and move the two contracts affected most to the test-suite\r\n3) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/486  => Shape and move all of the remaining tests to the test-suite folder\r\n\r\nThis PR follows refactor-vending-minter\r\n1) In refactor-vending-minter organized the tests for vending-minter so that the setup code is separated out\r\n2) In this PR create folder \"testing-suite\" in which all the tests will eventually go for launchpad\r\n\r\nIn this PR only doing this for sg-eth-airdrop and vending-minter.

Since I did a refactor there, figure I would continue on to the source and do some refactoring here. This idea later evolved into sharing all of the commonly reused code for a test-suite folder (developed in parts 2 and 3). \r\n \r\n 1) The main feature added here is the `configure_minter` function. The interface of the function looks like so: \r\n ```rs\r\n pub fn configure_minter(\r\n    app: &mut StargazeApp,\r\n    minter_admin: Addr,\r\n    collection_params_vec: Vec<CollectionParams>,\r\n    minter_instantiate_params_vec: Vec<MinterInstantiateParams>,\r\n) -> Vec<MinterCollectionResponse> {\r\n```\r\n2) configure_minter takes two vectors, 1) a vector of collection parameters for providing whichever collections should be tied to minters and 2) a vector of MinterInstantiateParams which contain some settings when instantiating a minter (such as minter start time or splits address). Since vectors are provided, a dev could instantiate any number of minter contracts tied to collections (this may be useful in marketplace if we want to quickly instantiate a whole list of collections). \r\n3) `configure_minter` returns a vector of `MinterCollectionResponse` objects. The message looks like so: \r\n```rs\r\npub struct MinterCollectionResponse {\r\n    pub minter: Option<Addr>,\r\n    pub collection: Option<Addr>,\r\n    pub factory: Option<Addr>,\r\n    pub error: Option<Error>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this way, a developer can call configure minter and get back the minter, factory and collection addresses for each one that is generated in the test. \r\n4) The error return of `MinterCollectionResponse` allows a dev to peer into any errors returned quickly without special logic. In the following example we try to generate a collection before genesis time and get an error:\r\n```rs\r\n    let minter_collection_response: Vec<MinterCollectionResponse> = configure_minter(\r\n        &mut router,\r\n        creator.clone(),\r\n        vec![collection_params.clone()],\r\n        vec![minter_params],\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    let err = minter_collection_response[0]\r\n        .error\r\n        .as_ref()\r\n        .unwrap()\r\n        .root_cause();\r\n    let expected_error = ContractError::BeforeGenesisTime {};\r\n ```", "reactions": {"url":

are 3 PRs in this series: \r\n1) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/479  => Refactors the vending minter tests that will serve as the common core for other similar tests\r\n2) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483  => Create the test-suite folder where all tests will eventually go and move the two contracts affected most to the test-suite\r\n3) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/486  => Shape and move all of the remaining tests to the test-suite folder\r\n\r\nHere we move all of the remaining tests to the test-suite folder.\r\n\r\n1)  Note that the test-suite/common_setup folder now gets a new folder /setup_minter. Setup minter has two implementations, 1) vending minter and 2) base minter. These two setups share a lot of the same code but use some different pieces where a simple code fork would make it too complex. \r\n2)   The main motivation of the test-suite is so that a vending-minter or base-minter with collection could easily be setup. With the help of /common_setup/templates.rs we can now do this in just four lines: \r\n```rs\r\n    let vt = vending_minter_template(4);\r\n    let (mut router, creator, buyer) = (vt.router, vt.creator, vt.buyer);\r\n    let minter_addr = vt.collection_response_vec[0].minter.clone().unwrap();\r\n    let collection_addr = vt.collection_response_vec[0].collection.clone().unwrap();\r\n```\r\nIf we want to get base minter instead we can do something similar: \r\n```rs\r\n    let bmt = base_minter_with_sg721(1);\r\n    let (mut router, creator, buyer) = (bmt.router, bmt.creator, bmt.buyer);\r\n    let minter_addr = bmt.collection_response_vec[0].minter.clone().unwrap();\r\n    let collection_addr = bmt.collection_response_vec[0].collection.clone().unwrap();\r\n```\r\n3) The /common_setup/templates.rs provides pre-written setups of commonly used minter and collection configurations. If you want something that is not provided, you can just write another function that does the additional setup you need. \r\n\r\n4) For minter setups that don't fit in nicely with the templates approach, you have the ability to specify parameters directly. The function to call is `configure_base_minter` with a proper set of `collection_params` and `minter_params`. Here is an example: \r\n```rs\r\n    let mut router = custom_mock_app();\r\n    let (creator, buyer) = setup_accounts(&mut router);\r\n    let start_time = Timestamp::from_nanos(GENESIS_MINT_START_TIME);\r\n    let collection_params = mock_collection_params_1(Some(start_time));\r\n    let minter_params = minter_params_token(num_tokens);\r\n    let code_ids = base_minter_sg721_nt_code_ids(&mut router);\r\n    let minter_collection_response = configure_base_minter(\r\n        &mut router,\r\n        creator.clone(),\r\n        vec![collection_params],\r\n        vec![minter_params],\r\n        code_ids,\r\n    );\r\n ```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/486/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/486/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, "chosen_detail": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/pulls/486", "id": 1169201941, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG4vgis5FsJsV", "html_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/486", "diff_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/486.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/486.patch", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/public-awesome/launchpad/issues/486", "number": 486, "state": "closed", "locked": false, "title": "Move all remaining tests to test suite", "user": {"login": "humanalgorithm", "id": 32441941, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQxOTQx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32441941?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm", "html_url": "https://github.com/humanalgorithm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanalgorithm/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Part 3\r\nThere are 3 PRs in this series: \r\n1) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/479  => Refactors the vending minter tests that will serve as the common core for other similar tests\r\n2) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/483  => Create the test-suite folder where all tests will eventually go and move the two contracts affected most to the test-suite\r\n3) https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/pull/486  => Shape and move all of the remaining tests to the test-suite folder\r\n\r\nHere we move all of the remaining tests to the test-suite folder.\r\n\r\n1)  Note that the test-suite/common_setup folder now gets a new folder /setup_minter.
