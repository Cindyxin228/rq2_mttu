The test `test_old_and_new_runtime_config_format_match` then\r\niterates through all existing versions and compares the serde\r\ndeserialization with configs loaded from TXT files. This is all we need to\r\nverify correctness of the parameters loaded through the new files.\r\n\r\nThe new TXT file format also comes with custom parsing logic.
