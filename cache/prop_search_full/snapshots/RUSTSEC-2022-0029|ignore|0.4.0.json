The commit messages have most of the details (including some goodies like a 2x decrease in release build time), but the TL;DR is that ripgrep now recognizes a `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. When set and non-empty, ripgrep will read shell arguments from it (one per line) and prepend them to whatever explicit CLI arguments have been given. A new flag, `--no-config`, prevents any sort of configuration from being loaded from a file.\r\n\r\nThis does not add any support for auto-loading config files from pre-determined locations like one's `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory.
