The SSO credentials provider is no longer enabled by default in <code>aws-config</code>, and so SSO profile config will no longer work out of box. The <code>credentials-sso</code> feature in <code>aws-config</code> was removed from the default features, and renamed to <code>sso</code>.

Use <code>into_parts()</code> instead</li>\n<li>The arguments of <code>SignableRequest::new</code> were changed to accept string types instead of types from the HTTP crate</li>\n<li><code>SigningInstructions::apply_to_request</code> was gated beyond an <code>http0-compat</code> feature flag for backwards compatibility. This API MAY be removed in a future release.</li>\n<li>Several public accessors were removed from <code>SigningInstructions</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>:warning: (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/2911\">smithy-rs#2911</a>) In sigV4-related code, rename 'signing service' to 'signing name'.

To determine if the field was actually set use <code>.&lt;field_name&gt;.is_some()</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>:warning: (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/2978\">smithy-rs#2978</a>) The <code>futures_core::stream::Stream</code> trait has been removed from public API. It should not affect usual SDK use cases. If your code uses paginators, you do not need to use the <code>Stream</code> trait or its exntension traits, but only the <code>next</code>, <code>try_next</code>, <code>collect</code>, and <code>try_collect</code> methods are supported on <code>PaginationStream</code>. Other stream operations that were previously available through the trait or its extension traits can be added later in a backward compatible manner.
