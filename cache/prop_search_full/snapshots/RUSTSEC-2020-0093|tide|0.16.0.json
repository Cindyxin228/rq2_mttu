https://github.com/rust-lang/log/issues/437\r\n\r\nThe `log` crate has an unstable structured logging API under the `kv_unstable` feature. In previous releases, if you specified both the `kv_unstable` and `std` features of `log` like so:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nlog = { features = [\"std\", \"kv_unstable\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou'd get support for standard library types in `log`'s structured logging API.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, this functionality is now gated under `kv_unstable_std`:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nlog = { features = [\"kv_unstable_std\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was made because we need to enable features in optional dependencies when both the `std` and `kv_unstable` features are enabled, which isn't currently supported by Cargo.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates this library to follow the new approach. It can be merged at any time and is currently non-blocking, but on 2020-01-18 the version of `log` requiring `kv_unstable_std` instead of `kv_unstable` and `std` will be published.\r\n\r\nThanks for trying out `log`'s structured logging API and sorry for any disruption! :bow:", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/776/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":
