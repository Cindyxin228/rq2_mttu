Simple -> Expand\r\n    * If we start with `api` as a module in the beta, we are free to expand to a separate crate in the future without it being a breaking change. We cannot go from `tauri-api` -> `mod api` however since some projects may have an explicit dependency on the `tauri-api` crate. Having the option to go either way seems the best as we see how ergonomic it can be in the future.\r\n\r\n2. Easier to keep track of and reduce transitive dependencies.\r\n    * We have close to ~400 transitive dependencies. This makes it a bit easier to try and reduce dependency usage by having everything in once place. This is something I want to explore in the future since the current high dependency count creates a lot of linker time. Not only straight up removing dependencies, but also having cleaner separation between them and features.\r\n\r\n3. Easier to keep versions in sync\r\n    * Not only for publishing, but it makes it harder for someone to accidentally upgrade `tauri` while having an un-upgraded version of `tauri-api` if they happen to have both in their manifest. (and vice versa).\r\n---\r\n### Why is `tauri-utils` not included?\r\n\r\n1. We need to use items from it inside `tauri-build`/`tauri-codegen`/`tauri-macros`. Since this would create a circular dependency, we keep it split. \r\n2. In the future I want to expand the config functionality to include items the rust cli needs, and have it depend on `tauri-utils`.\r\n\r\nIn short, `tauri-utils` can be thought of as \"Tauri specific things that are useful outside of the actual application\".  Currently this is basically the config parser/(de)serializer/token builder and the asset key parser.  They are very specific to Tauri, but their output is useful in more places than just inside the application. Sometimes called `tauri-common` by a lot of crates, but `utils` means basically the same thing and we already have it published.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis was kept as non-changing as possible because it's already a 1500 line diff. I think the items exported right now are probably fine, as it's basically what it was before - although maybe we refine it in the future. Also, I think some type aliases exported at the crate root like `ApiError` and `UpdaterError` are useful instead of having `crate::Error`, `crate::api::Error`, `crate::updater::Error`.

Unsafe\r\n     * #1370 introduces the first unsafe code to be directly used in `tauri`. Of course `wry` uses a lot of unsafe under the hood, but it's mostly self contained. We should probably be avoiding unsafe in `tauri` unless there is a good, measurable reason to use it.\r\n    * IMO the introduced unsafe code seems relatively useless because the unsafely manipulated String (as a Vec) is then later used to concatenate into a new String allocation. I think effort is better spent to just build it normally and avoid `format!`.\r\n    * I'm not against all unsafe code, but there should probably be a measurable benchmark against a safe alternative so that we can understand the benefits.\r\n \r\n2. Minimum size to escape at\r\n    * The gains of `JSON.parse` are only seen after a certain size, otherwise it's slower for small items. `10KiB` was just set arbitrarily from the [advice given in the blog post that introduced the practice.](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json).\r\n    * Not only is it slower for small items on the JS side, but it introduces at a minimum 1 extra allocation if we decide to escape an item on the rust side. In the unsafe code it's two extra allocations minimum.\r\n    * I think it could useful to make a benchmark to measure what this minimum threshold is if we wish to absolutely maximize performance of this function. Since we build for different targets, we might even be able to set different sizes for different `target_os`'s.\r\n \r\n3. API exposure\r\n    * I moved the constants and the escaping function out of the `pub` scope. I'm not sure if this was planned to expose, but I'm not sure of the use-case of calling either the constants or the escaping function outside of `fn format_callback`. If possible we should avoid putting it in pub scope so that we don't need to worry about backwards compatibility with them in the future.\r\n\r\nHere's some notes of the specifics of this implementation change:\r\n* `fn format_callback` now returns a `crate::Result<String>` instead of `String`. This is because constructing a `RawValue` is a bit of a pain, so the next easiest parameter to use is a `Serialize`.  We can just accept a `RawValue` if that's desired and leave it up to the caller. Also, it takes a reference of the serializable item now.\r\n* `debug_assert!` for passing string literal too large to be represented as a JavaScript string literal\r\n* I left 2 `todo` comments that I am interested to know your thoughts on\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the spirit of minimizing allocations to allow this callback serialization to stay as fast as possible. It would be helpful to have benchmarks for this because I have no idea how much this specific serialization matters in the larger picture, and some data would be great.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1443/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1443/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1442", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1442/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1442/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1442/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/1442", "id": 852070117, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjEwMzgzMjEz", "number": 1442, "title": "feat: create-tauri-app wiring", "user": {"login": "jbolda", "id": 2019387, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTkzODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2019387?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda", "html_url": "https://github.com/jbolda", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jbolda/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-07T06:46:41Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-07T18:32:17Z", "closed_at": "2021-04-11T09:22:08Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/pulls/1442", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/1442", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/1442.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/1442.patch", "merged_at": "2021-04-11T09:22:08Z"}, "body": "This PR is wiring up all the existing code / PRs into the same bundle.\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are introducing a new binding, you must reference an issue where this binding has been proposed, discussed and approved by the maintainers.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] New Binding Issue #___\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications in an attached issue.

The goal being as fast as possible asset inclusion for debug builds.\r\n\r\nThis first commit is mostly for release builds, but I'm curious how it handles on debug. Doing more work to prevent later work is pretty iffy for proc-macros because they are also compiled in debug mode for debug builds - which can make any fast (--release) computation work rather slow. The steps will go from trying to prevent excess work in the macro being done, to including uncompressed files, to finally reading straight from disk.
