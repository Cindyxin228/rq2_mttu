Improved metrics gathering.\r\n- Stabilization and better test coverage of the `fuel-vm`. We removed almost all unsafe code and added test cases for each opcode. Fixed some edge cases with memory in the `fuel-vm`.\r\n- Fully integrated Merkle trees and filled all malleable fields in the transactions.\r\n- Added retryable messages, removed redundant fields from it, and updated the API to support a new commitment schema.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Breaking\r\n\r\n- All unsafe functions were replaced with safe analog in the `fuel-crypto` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/346\r\n- `$hp` holds the address of the last available byte in a heap, while previously it was `$hp - 1` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/377\r\n- Each variant in the `fuel_tx::Input` enum now has its own type - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/364\r\n- Message nonce is unified and now `Bytes32` everywhere - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/394\r\n- Removed the `message_id` field from all places - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/397, https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/373, \r\n- Unified the block height in all places with the introduction of a new `BlockHeigh` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/410\r\n- Make SMO instruction take data ptr as an argument -  https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/404\r\n- Now the chain id affects the signature and predicate's owner and should be passed into the `sign` function - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/406\r\n- Updated the `produce_blocks` endpoint to accept the start time and the number of blocks. All new blocks will use the previous timestamp as a base - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1059\r\n- The `fuel-core` stores only unspent coins and messages, so all API that previously returned spent coins is affected - Prune owned coin idx when inputs are spent by @Voxelot in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1055\r\n- The message proof API has been changed to be compatible with a new version - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1071\r\n- The `fuel-core` now has retryable messages and coin messages. Retryable messages can only be consumed during successful transaction execution. The coin message acts as common coins. `resouces_to_spend` API was replaced with `coins_to_spend` that returns a new `CoinType` type. - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1067\r\n\r\n## All

most of the changes from the https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1157 but for the `master` branch.\r\nIt adds two e2e tests, but they fail because of new changes in the `fuel-vm`(the change to the `PC` register). It is not critical, but replacing them with the correct scripts later would be nice.\r\n- One test uploads the contract with a huge large state and executes it. The test takes a lot of time to execute and highlights that we have performance problems with the state calculation: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1143\r\n- Another test is more of a base for spamming the testnets. We can put any hex-encoded transaction and dry run it on the network. It contains a simple transfer transaction right now.\r\n\r\nThe change improves the `fuel-core snapshot` command to accept the arguments, and you can either snap the whole state of the blockchain via the `everyone` command, or the state only of the contract. In the follow-up PRs we can snapping of the coins and messages too.\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n- Use a lru cache to store the uncompressed data in the DB. The size is configurable via CLI `max-database-cache-size`.\r\n- Added a `DryRun` execution type that skips the coinbase `Mint` transaction. In the future, we can skip some non-actual steps too.\r\n- Updated the `PrometheusExtension` to not use the lock.\r\n- Removed usage of the tracing extension in the graph QL because we have `PrometheusExtension` to gather the statistic about requests. https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1152 removes the honeycomb, so I didn't duplicate it here.\r\n- Replaced the `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + `Semaphore` by `tokio_rayon::spawn_fifo`.\r\n- Replaced the concatenated `column_key` with the array for separate hash maps per column in the `MemoryStore` and `MemoryTransactionView`.\r\n- Replaced the `Vec<u8>` in the KV API by the `Arc<Vec<u8>>`, because in most cases, we use it only for deserialization, and the memory database can continue to store the type. It helps reduce the number of clones.\r\n- Used `BTreeMap` in the `MemoryStore`, because it allows to have a more optimized `iter_all` method. Without this change, a new e2e test fails with a timeout.\r\n- Dry run doesn't wait for relayer anymore.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1158/reactions",

It is helpful for `MemoryStore` and `MemoryTransactionView`.\r\n- Added a new e2e test for the contract with a large state. \r\n- Updated the `snapshot`command to do a snapshot only of the contract's state.\r\n- Updated the `MemoryStore` to use `BTreeMap` instead of `HashMap`. It significantly improved the performance of the `iter_all` without `RocksDB`. Without this optimization, a new e2e failed for `--no-default-features` build with a timeout(but worked with `RocksDB`).", "reactions": {"url":

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/373.\r\n\r\n- Updated the code to use named input types.\r\n- Removed the usage of the `MessageId` from all places except the `BlockHeader` and related to the block stuff.\r\n- Used `Nonce` as a primary key for messages instead of `MessageId`. Because of it, we don't need `CheckedMessage` anymore. Also, several tests failed because the nonce was the same.\r\n- Updated the `Nonce` from `u64` to 32 bytes. Updated the ABI to use `uint256` instead of `uint64` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-v2-contracts/pull/35\r\n- Renamed `Resources` into `Coins`. Renamed all comments and GraphQL API. Moved `coin.rs` and `resource.rs` into one `coins.rs`.\r\n- Fixed some tests for https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/377 not to increase the `HP`.\r\n- Removed usage of the `Output::Message`.\r\n- Renamed `message_output_count` - > `message_receipt_count` and `message_output_root` -> `message_receipt_root`\r\n\r\nAnd the main feature of why this change was created(implemented by several lines): \r\n`MessageData` aren't marked as spent unless included in a successfully executed script tx", "reactions": {"url":

`sync_max_get_txns` in the helm chart.\r\n\r\n# Release 0.18.0\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nA new release brings:\r\n- Optimization for the execution based on the performance from beta 3 and on internal benchmarks. Improved metrics gathering.\r\n- Stabilization and better test coverage of the `fuel-vm`. We removed almost all unsafe code and added test cases for each opcode. Fixed some edge cases with memory in the `fuel-vm`.\r\n- Fully integrated Merkle trees and filled all malleable fields in the transactions.\r\n- Added retryable messages, removed redundant fields from it, and updated the API to support a new commitment schema.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Breaking\r\n\r\n- All unsafe functions were replaced with safe analog in the `fuel-crypto` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/346\r\n- `$hp` holds the address of the last available byte in a heap, while previously it was `$hp - 1` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/377\r\n- Each variant in the `fuel_tx::Input` enum now has its own type - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/364\r\n- Message nonce is unified and now `Bytes32` everywhere - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/394\r\n- Removed the `message_id` field from all places - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/397, https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/373, \r\n- Unified the block height in all places with the introduction of a new `BlockHeigh` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/410\r\n- Make SMO instruction take data ptr as an argument -  https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/404\r\n- Now the chain id affects the signature and predicate's owner and should be passed into the `sign` function - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/406\r\n- Updated the `produce_blocks` endpoint to accept the start time and the number of blocks. All new blocks will use the previous timestamp as a base - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1059\r\n- The `fuel-core` stores only unspent coins and messages, so all API that previously returned spent coins is affected - Prune owned coin idx when inputs are spent by @Voxelot in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1055\r\n- The message proof API has been changed to be compatible with a new version - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1071\r\n- The `fuel-core` now has retryable messages and coin messages. Retryable messages can only be consumed during successful transaction execution. The coin message acts as common coins. `resouces_to_spend` API was replaced with `coins_to_spend` that returns a new `CoinType` type. - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1067\r\n\r\n## All
