Callers wanting to\nprocess the contents of a symlink (e.g. for remove_dir_contents) should\nresolve the symlink themselves. This is an API break from 0.7.0, but the previous behaviour was insecure.</p>\n<p>This is due to the same code pattern as caused CVE-2022-21658 in Rust itself:\nit was possible to trick a privileged process doing a recursive delete in an\nattacker controlled directory into deleting privileged files, on all operating\nsystems.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider deleting a tree called 'etc' in a parent directory\ncalled 'p'. Between calling <code>remove_dir_all(&quot;a&quot;)</code> and remove_dir_all(&quot;a&quot;)\nactually starting its work, the attacker can move 'p' to 'p-prime', and\nreplace 'p' with a symlink to '/'. Then the privileged process deletes 'p/etc'\nwhich is actually /etc, and now your system is broken. There are some\nmitigations for this exact scenario, such as CWD relative file lookup, but\nthey are not guaranteed - any code using absolute paths will not have that\nprotection in place.</p>\n<p>The same attack could be performed at any point in the directory tree being\ndeleted: if 'a' contains a child directory called 'etc', attacking the\ndeletion by replacing 'a' with a link is possible.</p>\n<p>The new code in this release mitigates the attack within the directory tree\nbeing deleted by using file-handle relative operations: to open 'a/etc', the\npath 'etc' relative to 'a' is opened, where 'a' is represented by a file\ndescriptor (Unix) or handle (Windows). With the exception of the entry points\ninto the directory deletion logic, this is robust against manipulation of the\ndirectory hierarchy, and remove_dir_all will only delete files and directories\ncontained in the tree it is deleting.</p>\n<p>The entry path however is a challenge - as described above, there are some\npotential mitigations, but since using them must be done by the calling code,\nit is hard to be confident about the security properties of the path based\ninterface.</p>\n<p>The new extension trait <code>RemoveDir</code> provides an interface where it is much\nharder to get it wrong.</p>\n<p><code>somedir.remove_dir_contents(&quot;name-of-child&quot;)</code>.</p>\n<p>Callers can then make their own security evaluation about how to securely get\na directory handle. That is still not particularly obvious, and we're going to\nfollow up with a helper of some sort (probably in the <code>fs_at</code> crate). Once\nthat is available, the path based entry points will get deprecated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
