decryption password.\n\nIn scenarios where a Vault-like server is used to emit PKI certificates,\nPFX files are not really used and certificates private key material is\ninstalled in non swappable RAM locations directly without any decryption\npassword required.\n\nThis simplifies automatic rotation and rollouts to production\ndeployments when this is available.\n\nBefore this, it would be necessary to re-encode PEM-encoded DER private\nkey via openssl with an empty password and store it in another runtime\nlocation.\n\nI'm not exactly sure yet if this is the right design for it (in the context of the library),\ne.g. I don't know if I'm breaking needlessly backward compatibility.\n\nI'm also a bit dubious whether I should concatenate the CA cert chain to configure `rusttls`\nif it's available.\n\nSigned-off-by: Raito Bezarius <masterancpp@gmail.com>\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amqp-rs/tcp-stream/issues/7/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
