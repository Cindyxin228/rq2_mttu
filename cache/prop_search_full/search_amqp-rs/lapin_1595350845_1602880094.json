seems to solve the particular issue we bumped into).\r\n\r\nWhen a queue was re-declared over the same channel we would lose track of the associated consumers.\r\nWhen a message arrived on the connection directed at one of those \"orphan\" consumers we would get an UNEXPECTED_FRAME error, because when handling the method frame we would not find a corresponding consumer associated to the queue (given that it was re-declared after the consumer started).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want me to add a test to prevent regressions to the PR, but I thought it was worth it to flag it as early as
