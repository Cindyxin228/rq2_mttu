Types that derive `Decode` can declare fields as borrowing from input. This activates some special handling of `Cow`s, i.e. if they hold string or byte slices, the derived code will produce borrowed `Cow`s. This special handling does not kick in for types that do not derive `Decode`, e.g. `Vec`, `Option`, `BTreeMap` etc. `Cow`s as element types of such types will therefore not borrow from input data. To enable borrowing `Cow`s for such types, this PR adds two newtypes for `Cow<'_, str>` and `Cow<'_, [u8]>` that will always borrow from input, hence they are intended for use with `Vec`tors, `Option`s etc for cases where the usual `Cow` semantics are desired.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2807/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

provides initial support for message flow authorization within\r\nOckam nodes.\r\n\r\nAll incoming messages for an Ockam `Address` are now subject to an\r\nauthorization check implemented via the `AccessControl` trait before\r\nit will be accepted for further processing.\r\n\r\nMajor new api's introduced are:\r\n\r\n* `Context::start_worker_with_access_control(Address, Worker, AccessControl)`\r\n* `Context::new_repeater(AccessControl) -> RepeaterContext`\r\n* `Worker::is_authorized(&mut Self, Self::Context, Routed<Self::Message>)`\r\n* A new `access_control` attribute for the `#[ockam::node]` macro\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n\r\n### `DetachedContext`, `RepeaterContext`\r\n\r\nA `Context` with no associated worker or processor that can still send and receive messages.\r\n\r\nA `DetachedContext` inherits the access control of the parent `Context` which created it.\r\nA `RepeaterContext` requires that you specify access control for it on creation.\r\n\r\n### `Mailbox`\r\n\r\nA `Mailbox` is a single `Address` combined with `AccessControl`.\r\n\r\nPreviously a `Context` had a single `AccessControl` which was shared with all `Address`es.\r\n\r\n### `Mailboxes`\r\n\r\nReplaces `Context::address` with `Context::mailboxes`\r\n\r\nA collection of `Mailbox`es (`Address` + `AccessControl`)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n`Worker::handle_message` implementations that may have used a pattern like:\r\n\r\n    let msg = LocalMessage::decode(msg.payload())?;\r\n    self.handle_route(ctx, msg).await?;\r\n\r\nShould now use:\r\n\r\n    self.handle_route(ctx, msg.into_local_message()).await?;\r\n\r\n\r\n## A word about defaults\r\n\r\nAt present message flow authorization defaults to an `AllowAll` policy.\r\n\r\nThis is set by:\r\n\r\n* The `#[ockam::node]` macro creates the node's app `Context` with an\r\n  `AllowAll` policy when one has not been specified.\r\n* The `ockam::node::start_node()` function starts new nodes with an\r\n  `AllowAll` policy. You can use\r\n  `ockam::node::start_node_with_access_control()` to specify an\r\n  alternate policy.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this will migrate to a default of\r\n`LocalOriginOnly` as we update the rest of the codebase to use message\r\nflow authorization.\r\n\r\nAnother worthy goal may be to think about ways where we could set it\r\nto `DenyAll` by default without complectifying the ockam api learning\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The new `access_control` attribute for the `#[ockam::node]` macro\r\n\r\nBy default all nodes are started with an access control of `AllowAll`\r\nfor the `\"app\"` address.\r\n\r\nWhile we could have used the more restrictive `LocalOriginOnly` by\r\ndefault this would make our \"getting started\" examples more complex.\r\n\r\nAn example of overriding the default \"app\" access control is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    use hello_ockam::Echoer;\r\n    use ockam::access_control::{AllowedTransport, LocalOriginOnly};\r\n    use ockam::{Context, Result, TcpTransport, TCP};\r\n    use std::sync::Arc;\r\n\r\n    #[ockam::node(access_control = \"LocalOriginOnly\")]\r\n    async fn main(ctx: Context) -> Result<()> {\r\n        // Initialize the TCP Transport.\r\n        let tcp = TcpTransport::create(&ctx).await?;\r\n\r\n        // Create a TCP listener and wait for incoming connections.\r\n        tcp.listen(\"127.0.0.1:4000\").await?;\r\n\r\n        // Create an echoer worker\r\n        ctx.start_worker_with_access_control(\r\n            \"echoer\",\r\n            Echoer,\r\n            Arc::new(AllowedTransport::single(TCP))\r\n        )\r\n        .await?;\r\n\r\n        // Don't call ctx.stop() here so this node runs forever.\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom worker authorization handling with `Worker::is_authorized`\r\n\r\nThe worker trait has been extended with an optional `is_authorized` method:\r\n\r\n    async fn is_authorized(\r\n        &mut self,\r\n        _context: &mut Self::Context,\r\n        _msg: Routed<Self::Message>,\r\n    ) -> Result<bool> {\r\n        crate::allow()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis method will be invoked after any authorization performed on the\r\n`Address` of the worker and before the message is forwarded to the\r\nworker's `handle_message()` method is called.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for adding this trait instead of simply performing any\r\nextended authorization within the `Worker::handle_message()` call is\r\ntwofold:\r\n\r\n1. At some future point we may want to implement functionality to\r\n   optionally disable authorization checks for trouble-shooting\r\n   purposes.\r\n1.

payload)\r\nFixed in elixir on the worker level, but it's weird considering we're exchanging raw binary data anyway.\r\n\r\nMaybe in future Rust can work on `TransportMessage` level instead, because it's already doing double-encoding: https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/develop/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_channel/src/secure_channel_worker.rs#L176\r\n\r\nRust encodes first request (message1 initiator->responder) as `CreateResponderChannelMessage`, which has an optional `extra_payload` (in newer versions) or `completed_callback_address` (in current version)\r\nAdded `InitHandshake` structure to handle that, currently decoding the extra field as `:data`, which might break with the current version.\r\n\r\nNonce size was different for elixir (16bit) and rust (64bit) - changed to 64\r\n\r\nAlso in the encrypted communication there is no hash (it's empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the changes proposed in this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- If this pull request

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.1.0</h2>\n<h2>Main changes</h2>\n<p>This release lets you run Scorecards without creating a PAT token. If you don't provide a PAT token, Scorecards will use the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> available in the workflow. Due to limitations of the permissions model and GitHub APIs, be aware of the following limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Without a PAT, the Branch-Protection is not supported, so it will be disabled. You will not receive alerts for this check.</li>\n<li>Scorecards only supports PAT on private repositories. If you want to install Scorecards on a private repository, you still need to use a PAT.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/tree/v1.1.0#readme\">README.md</a></p>\n<h2>New Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rohankh532\"><code>@\u200brohankh532</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/112\">ossf/scorecard-action#112</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/justaugustus\"><code>@\u200bjustaugustus</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/126\">ossf/scorecard-action#126</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jamietanna\"><code>@\u200bjamietanna</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/145\">ossf/scorecard-action#145</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonasbb\"><code>@\u200bjonasbb</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/129\">ossf/scorecard-action#129</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/azeemshaikh38\"><code>@\u200bazeemshaikh38</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/pull/247\">ossf/scorecard-action#247</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/v1.0.4...v1.1.0\">https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/v1.0.4...v1.1.0</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/5c8bc69dc88b65c66584e07611df79d3579b0377\"><code>5c8bc69</code></a> multi-repo-action: Cleanups (1/n) (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/301\">#301</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/adf2f6d1429b0f0d08284f7f79ac9470edf6c8e2\"><code>adf2f6d</code></a> Update container hash for v1.1.0 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/314\">#314</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/f10ec7151e838890a3fbfa27875a33f80869977b\"><code>f10ec71</code></a> :seedling: Bump github.com/google/go-cmp from 0.5.7 to 0.5.8 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/206\">#206</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/13d967d55a9678d971de8a3def614d3fd573be5d\"><code>13d967d</code></a> :seedling: Bump actions/setup-go from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/3ed028d1a70c66985ea2bc24e7dcfda43b0b7894\"><code>3ed028d</code></a> :seedling: Bump golangci/golangci-lint-action from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/23e005799db4bb32470691854cc864118add832f\"><code>23e0057</code></a> :seedling: Bump github/codeql-action from 2.1.9 to 2.1.10 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/305\">#305</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/71abf05f45b0150b5de82249aae88b08bc3abde7\"><code>71abf05</code></a> :seedling: Bump github.com/caarlos0/env/v6 from 6.9.1 to 6.9.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/c9afc0ecb9701872b4e4791262a8cce4f330a97c\"><code>c9afc0e</code></a> :seedling: Bump github.com/sigstore/cosign from 1.7.2 to 1.8.0 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/212\">#212</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/e6b77425a0977a015e5ef16656f771c5b605af3b\"><code>e6b7742</code></a> :seedling: Bump debian from <code>f75d8a3</code> to <code>fbaacd5</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/287\">#287</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/commit/025c54db873c339c8323daedf723153801f00139\"><code>025c54d</code></a> update (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/ossf/scorecard-action/issues/293\">#293</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/compare/c1aec4ac820532bab364f02a81873c555a0ba3a1...5c8bc69dc88b65c66584e07611df79d3579b0377\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=ossf/scorecard-action&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=1.0.4&new-version=1.1.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

When transferring a 132MB file across Ockam the Outlet router allocated up to 14 THOUSAND addresses that were never cleared.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n\r\n1. adds some debug logging so that we can have a better understanding of how many addresses are registered on a system.  In the future we may also want to extend this metrics reporting to numbers of clusters, channel load, etc\r\n2. side-steps the normal shutdown mechanism for bare context records, which don't have a relay and can't interact with the \"new\" shutdown ACK mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis seems to fix the memory leak present in the demo.", "reactions": {"url":

finishes the worker pair may have already read the first message from the socket and when resolving the route, the router may in turn auto-connect to the address and will then make another registration attempt, ultimately causing an error as there can be only one mapping for a given address. See issue #2730 for details.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by deferring the spawning of the worker pair until the registration was completed.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2733/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2733/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2732", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2732/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2732/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2732/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2732", "id": 1232423905, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCYdddc43o-3O", "number": 2732, "title": "Vault persistence", "user": {"login": "SanjoDeundiak", "id": 6513916, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTM5MTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6513916?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak", "html_url": "https://github.com/SanjoDeundiak", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SanjoDeundiak/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-05-11T10:48:05Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-25T13:33:06Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-24T15:24:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/pulls/2732", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2732", "diff_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2732.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/2732.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-24T15:24:45Z"}, "body": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2732/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/2732/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
