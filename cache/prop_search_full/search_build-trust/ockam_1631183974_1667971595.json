You do not need to alter your code scanning workflows. If you encounter any problems, please <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues\">file an issue</a> or open a private ticket with GitHub Support and request an escalation to engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.26 - 29 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1267\">#1267</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.25 - 21 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We will soon be rolling out a feature of the CodeQL Action that stores some information used to make future runs faster in the GitHub Actions cache. Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step. Previously, CodeQL packs were downloaded during the <code>analyze</code> step. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1218\">#1218</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.4. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1224\">#1224</a></li>\n<li>The newly released <a href=\"https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0\">Poetry 1.2</a> is not yet supported. In the most common case where the CodeQL Action is automatically installing Python dependencies, it will continue to install and use Poetry 1.1 on its own. However, in certain cases such as with self-hosted runners, you may need to ensure Poetry 1.1 is installed yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.21 - 25 Aug 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve error messages when the code scanning configuration file includes an invalid <code>queries</code> block or an invalid <code>query-filters</code> block. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1208\">#1208</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

version to 2.11.2. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1320\">#1320</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.28 - 18 Oct 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1294\">#1294</a></li>\n<li>Replace uses of GitHub Actions command <code>set-output</code> because it is now deprecated. See more information in the <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/\">GitHub Changelog</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1301\">#1301</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.27 - 06 Oct 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature of the CodeQL Action in October 2022 that changes the way that Go code is analyzed to be more consistent with other compiled languages like C/C++, C#, and Java. You do not need to alter your code scanning workflows. If you encounter any problems, please <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues\">file an issue</a> or open a private ticket with GitHub Support and request an escalation to engineering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.26 - 29 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1267\">#1267</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.25 - 21 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We will soon be rolling out a feature of the CodeQL Action that stores some information used to make future runs faster in the GitHub Actions cache. Initially, this will only be enabled on JavaScript repositories, but we plan to add more languages to this soon. The new feature can be disabled by passing the <code>trap-caching: false</code> option to your workflow's <code>init</code> step, for example if you are already using the GitHub Actions cache for a different purpose and are near the storage limit for it.</li>\n<li>Add support for Python automatic dependency installation with Poetry 1.2 <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1258\">#1258</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.24 - 16 Sep 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.1.23 - 14 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow CodeQL packs to be downloaded from GitHub Enterprise Server instances, using the new <code>registries</code> input for the <code>init</code> action.  <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1221\">#1221</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1240\">#1240</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.22 - 01 Sep 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading CodeQL packs has been moved to the <code>init</code> step. Previously, CodeQL packs were downloaded during the <code>analyze</code> step. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1218\">#1218</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.10.4. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1224\">#1224</a></li>\n<li>The newly released <a href=\"https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0\">Poetry 1.2</a> is not yet supported. In the most common case where the CodeQL Action is automatically installing Python dependencies, it will continue to install and use Poetry 1.1 on its own. However, in certain cases such as with self-hosted runners, you may need to ensure Poetry 1.1 is installed yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.21 - 25 Aug 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve error messages when the code scanning configuration file includes an invalid <code>queries</code> block or an invalid <code>query-filters</code> block. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1208\">#1208</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug where Go build tracing could fail on Windows. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1209\">#1209</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.20 - 22 Aug 2022</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

okta`: the user passes the okta's certificate, tenant and client_id as arguments.

[here](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/polvorin/fix-services-from-startup-config/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_command/src/node/create.rs#L300) , passing it to  services start calls like [here](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/polvorin/fix-services-from-startup-config/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_command/src/node/create.rs#L364)  .\r\n\r\nNote: didn't pass it to the[ secure_channel_listener creator ](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/polvorin/fix-services-from-startup-config/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_command/src/node/create.rs#L381),  as its implementation is different than the rest :man_shrugging: .   But this one didn't cause the problem that the others did.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the changes proposed in this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- If this pull request resolves an already recorded bug or a feature request, please add a link to that issue. -->\r\n\r\n## Checks\r\n\r\n<!-- To help us review and merge this pull request quickly, please confirm the following:  -->\r\n\r\n- [X] All commits in this Pull Request are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and Verified by Github.\r\n- [X] All commits in this Pull Request follow the Ockam [commit message convention](https://github.com/build-trust/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [X] I accept the Ockam Community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/build-trust/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [X] I have accepted the Ockam [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CLA.md) by adding my Git/Github details in a row at the end of the [CONTRIBUTORS.csv](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.csv) file in a separate pull request to the [build-trust/ockam-contributors](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors) repository.\r\n\r\n<!-- Looking forward to merging your contribution!! -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3656/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3656/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3655", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3655/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3655/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3655/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/3655", "id": 1408493084, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCYdddc5AxdB3", "number": 3655, "title": "chore(typescript): remove wasm and napi prototypes", "user": {"login": "mrinalwadhwa", "id": 159583, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU4Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159583?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa", "html_url": "https://github.com/mrinalwadhwa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrinalwadhwa/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-10-13T22:23:28Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-09T07:07:51Z", "closed_at": "2022-10-13T22:40:29Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/pulls/3655", "html_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/3655", "diff_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/3655.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/pull/3655.patch", "merged_at": "2022-10-13T22:40:29Z"}, "body": "remove stale typescript prototypes\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3655/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/3655/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
