changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.7.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleDoc</code> works for Phoenix 1.7+ views</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now ignores custom operators</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Refactor.Apply</code> now works in pipes</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Consistency.ExceptionNames</code> does no longer yield an issue if there is only one match</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleNames</code> now supports an <code>:ignore</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Design.AliasUsage</code> now supports an <code>:if_referenced</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now works for acronyms in predicate functions</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.NestedFunctionCalls</code> now works for calls already in a pipeline and local function calls</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Add SARIF support</h3>\n<p>Credo 1.7 provides a formatter that will output data in <a href=\"http://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net\">SARIF</a> format, allowing <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github\">direct GitHub support</a> via the <code>Security</code> tab.</p>\n<p>You can now use <code>mix credo --format=sarif</code> to output results in SARIF format.</p>\n<h3>Add IDs to checks</h3>\n<p>This was requested for SARIF support and has been added to provide a unique identifier for checks that is more technical than the check name.</p>\n<p>Check authors can add IDs to their custom checks by using the <code>:id</code> option:</p>\n<pre><code>defmodule MyCheck do\n  use Credo.Check,\n    id: &quot;EX5042&quot;,\n    category: :warning,\n    # ...\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>Credo's naming scheme for these IDs is simple:</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n^^\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>EX</code> stands for Elixir.</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n  ^\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first digit represents the category.</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n   ^\n</code></pre>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

views</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now ignores custom operators</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Refactor.Apply</code> now works in pipes</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Consistency.ExceptionNames</code> does no longer yield an issue if there is only one match</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleNames</code> now supports an <code>:ignore</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Design.AliasUsage</code> now supports an <code>:if_referenced</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now works for acronyms in predicate functions</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.NestedFunctionCalls</code> now works for calls already in a pipeline and local function calls</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Add SARIF support</h3>\n<p>Credo 1.7 provides a formatter that will output data in <a href=\"http://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net\">SARIF</a> format, allowing <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github\">direct GitHub support</a> via the <code>Security</code> tab.</p>\n<p>You can now use <code>mix credo --format=sarif</code> to output results in SARIF format.</p>\n<h3>Add IDs to checks</h3>\n<p>This was requested for SARIF support and has been added to provide a unique identifier for checks that is more technical than the check name.</p>\n<p>Check authors can add IDs to their custom checks by using the <code>:id</code> option:</p>\n<pre><code>defmodule MyCheck do\n  use Credo.Check,\n    id: &quot;EX5042&quot;,\n    category: :warning,\n    # ...\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>Credo's naming scheme for these IDs is simple:</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n^^\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>EX</code> stands for Elixir.</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n  ^\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first digit represents the

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.7.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleDoc</code> works for Phoenix 1.7+ views</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now ignores custom operators</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Refactor.Apply</code> now works in pipes</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Consistency.ExceptionNames</code> does no longer yield an issue if there is only one match</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleNames</code> now supports an <code>:ignore</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Design.AliasUsage</code> now supports an <code>:if_referenced</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now works for acronyms in predicate functions</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.NestedFunctionCalls</code> now works for calls already in a pipeline and local function calls</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Add SARIF support</h3>\n<p>Credo 1.7 provides a formatter that will output data in <a href=\"http://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net\">SARIF</a> format, allowing <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github\">direct GitHub support</a> via the <code>Security</code> tab.</p>\n<p>You can now use <code>mix credo --format=sarif</code> to output results in SARIF format.</p>\n<h3>Add IDs to checks</h3>\n<p>This was requested for SARIF support and has been added to provide a unique identifier for checks that is more technical than the check name.</p>\n<p>Check authors can add IDs to their custom checks by using the <code>:id</code> option:</p>\n<pre><code>defmodule MyCheck do\n  use Credo.Check,\n    id: &quot;EX5042&quot;,\n    category: :warning,\n    # ...\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>Credo's naming scheme for these IDs is simple:</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n^^\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>EX</code> stands for Elixir.</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n  ^\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first digit represents the category.</p>\n<pre><code>EX5042\n   ^\n</code></pre>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.7.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleDoc</code> works for Phoenix 1.7+ views</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now ignores custom operators</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Refactor.Apply</code> now works in pipes</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Consistency.ExceptionNames</code> does no longer yield an issue if there is only one match</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleNames</code> now supports an <code>:ignore</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Design.AliasUsage</code> now supports an <code>:if_referenced</code> parameter</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames</code> now works for acronyms in predicate functions</li>\n<li><code>Credo.Check.Readability.NestedFunctionCalls</code> now works for calls already in a pipeline and local function calls</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Add SARIF support</h3>\n<p>Credo 1.7 provides a formatter that will output data in <a href=\"http://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net\">SARIF</a> format, allowing <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github\">direct GitHub support</a> via the <code>Security</code> tab.</p>\n<p>You can now use <code>mix credo --format=sarif</code> to output results in SARIF format.</p>\n<h3>Add IDs to checks</h3>\n<p>This was requested for SARIF support and has been added to provide a unique identifier for checks that is more technical than the check name.</p>\n<p>Check authors can add IDs to their custom checks by using the <code>:id</code> option:</p>\n<pre><code>defmodule MyCheck do\n  use Credo.Check,\n    id: &quot;EX5042&quot;,\n    category: :warning,\n    # ...\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>Credo's naming scheme for these IDs is

Then, on the teardown stage of the test, when running the `teardown_home_dir` function, we iterate through that list and remove all the resources automatically.\r\n\r\nThere is no need now to explicitly teardown OCKAM_HOME's.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/build-trust/ockam/issues/4654/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

behavior\r\n\r\n- Trust Context relies on a JSON file always\r\n- No Default Trust Context\r\n- Trust Context parameter can only be a json file\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior of the code before the changes in this pull request is applied. -->\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- `ockam trust-context create` \r\n    -  Creates and stores a trust context from the Project Files/States, Credentials, Trust Context JSON files, and auto defaults to the default project\r\n- removes `--as-trust-context` option from project and credential\r\n    - A user can use the following to create and store a trust context\r\n    - `ockam trust-context create [name]` (defaults to default project)\r\n    - `ockam trust-context create [name] --project [PROJECT_NAME]`\r\n    - `ockam trust-context create [name] --credential [CREDENTIAL_NAME]`\r\n- Trust Context is stored within the CLI state\r\n- Trust Context has a default option\r\n- Commands using `--trust-context` [ockam node create, enroll, auth, etc] will use the default trust context if available\r\n- `--trust-context` option accepts both a path and cli state name\r\n\r\n \r\n<!-- Please describe the changes proposed in this

Later on, cargo-deny [implemented their own version of the same setting](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/420).\n\nAt the time of writing, `cargo-deny` does not permit any kind of layered configuration, configuration inheritance, or environment variables to tune this behavior in a way that does not require changes in-repo to enable. In practice this would switch all users to use the `git` CLI directly any time `cargo-deny advisories fetch` is implicitly or explicitly run, while not affecting other `cargo` usage. This shouldn't have negative implications, other than the very slight overhead of shelling out to a new command as a separate subprocess.\n\n## Checks\n\n<!-- To help us review and merge this pull request quickly, please confirm the following:  -->\n\n- [X] All commits in this Pull Request are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and Verified by Github.\n- [X] All commits in this Pull Request follow the Ockam [commit message convention](https://github.com/build-trust/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\n- [X] I accept the Ockam Community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/build-trust/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- [X] I have accepted the Ockam [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CLA.md) by adding my Git/Github details in a row at the end of the [CONTRIBUTORS.csv](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.csv) file in a separate pull request to the [build-trust/ockam-contributors](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors) repository.

Issue credentials for each, and start each node with a trust_context using this info, outlet from one to the other => OK\r\n* Start an authority node and two nodes, configure a trust_context on them with an online authority, pointing to the one started. outlet from one to the other => OK (nodes will need to be enrolled with the authority, use the ockam authority enroll for that)\r\n\r\n2. Add a way to configure \"routes\" at ockam node creation (and other commands like \"ockam message\", etc).\r\n\r\n3. Add new commands to the cli. Like ockam project trust_context --output json to output a .json that can be ingested as trust context, and ockam project route aliases to output the routes.json one. For now, implement both of these based on the existing \"project info\" RPC call that returns these two things together.\r\n\r\n4. Update bats test to not use project-path\r\n## Checks\r\n\r\n<!-- To help us review and merge this pull request quickly, please confirm the following:  -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] All commits in this Pull Request are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and Verified by Github.\r\n- [ ] All commits in this Pull Request follow the Ockam [commit message convention](https://github.com/build-trust/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [ ] I accept the Ockam Community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/build-trust/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [ ] I have accepted the Ockam [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CLA.md) by adding my Git/Github details in a row at the end of the [CONTRIBUTORS.csv](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.csv) file in a separate pull request to the [build-trust/ockam-contributors](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam-contributors) repository.

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dtolnay/syn/issues/1409\">#1409</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.0</h2>\n<p>This release contains a batch of syntax tree improvements to incorporate ongoing Rust language development from the past 3.5 years since syn 1.</p>\n<p>It never seems like an ideal time to finalize a syntax tree design, considering the frankly alarming number of syntax-disrupting language features currently in flight: keyword generics, restrictions, capabilities and contexts, conditional constness, new varieties of literals, dyn revamp such as explicitly dyn-safe traits and dyn-star, expression syntax in various phases of being added or being torn out (const blocks, try blocks, raw references), auto traits and negative impls, generalizations to higher rank trait bounds, async closures and static async trait methods, postfix keywords, pattern types, return type notation, unsafe attributes, \u2026</p>\n<p>The plan continues to be the same as laid out originally in the 1.0.0 release announcement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be aware that the underlying Rust language will continue to evolve. Syn is able to accommodate most kinds of Rust grammar changes via the nonexhaustive enums and <code>Verbatim</code> variants in the syntax tree, but we will plan to put out new major versions on a 12 to 24 month cadence to incorporate ongoing language changes as needed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If anything, the takeaway from the 3.5 year longevity of syn 1 is that this period was tamer from a language development perspective than anticipated, but that is unlikely to last and I think around 24 months is still the correct cadence to expect between releases going forward.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h1>Breaking changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum required Rust version is raised from rustc 1.31 to 1.56.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Expressions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Support for <code>box expr</code> syntax has been deleted, as it has been deleted recently from rustc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for type ascription syntax <code>expr: Type</code> in expression position has been deleted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
