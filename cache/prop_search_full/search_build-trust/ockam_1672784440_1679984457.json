Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Windows URL encoding for multiple query params\nPreviously, passing a URL with multiple query parameters on Windows would result in\nimproper escaping, causing unexpected behavior when using it with &quot;cmd /c&quot;.\nThis commit addresses this issue by properly escaping all query parameters in the URL.\nNow, URLs with multiple query parameters are handled correctly on Windows.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

1.62.\nThis version is motivated only when compiling on windows (but we can't differentiate that)\ndue to the recent addition of <code>CommandExt::raw_arg()</code>.</p>\n<p>This might be a breaking

`node`.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Solves https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/issues/4421 and https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/issues/4435 by introducing the `tcp-outlet show` and `tcp-inlet show` commands\r\n\r\n- Adds corresponding bats tests\r\n\r\n- Refactored `DeleteInlet` and `DeleteOutlet` into an in-route `alias` param\r\n\r\n- Adjusted previous `tcp-inlet`/`tcp-outlet` CRUD tests to use output from `tcp-inlet`/`tcp-outlet` `show` commands in assertions\r\n\r\n- Added missing `tcp-outlet list` test\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `tcp-inlet CRUD` test would fail to properly assert the deletion of a non existing inlet\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checks\r\n\r\n<!-- To help us review and merge this pull request quickly, please confirm the following:  -->\r\n\r\n- [X] All commits
