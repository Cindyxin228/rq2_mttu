precomputed tables for basepoint\nscalar multiplication.</li>\n<li>Fix an unused import.</li>\n<li>Add support for using the <code>zeroize</code> traits with all point types.\nNote that points are not automatically zeroized on Drop, but that\nconsumers of <code>curve25519-dalek</code> should call these methods manually\nwhen
