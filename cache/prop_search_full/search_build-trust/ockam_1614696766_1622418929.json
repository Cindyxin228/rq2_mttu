Application workers can exchange messages\r\n1. Application worker ONLY use Ockam Routing protocol\r\n1. Messages can be persisted and re-delivered after network outages\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nIn order to establish bidirectional communication between ockam workers,\r\nockam routing protocol is using route tracing.\r\n\r\nEach communication hop should produce a return route, which should be usable to\r\nroute the message back.\r\n\r\nTo use unidirectional channels (like streams) to deliver messages, a message on\r\nthe channel should contain an other channel ID to produce a response.\r\n\r\nSince the return stream information is in the messages, there may be different\r\nreturn streams in those.\r\n\r\n## Routing\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes routing to NODES, meaning that messages will be routed\r\non receiving nodes using the Ockam Routing protocol.\r\n\r\nThis is done to simplify route tracing.\r\n\r\nStream APIs in this proposal are accessed using LOCAL worker addresses.\r\n\r\nExample sending a message through stream:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonward_route: [\"bds_publisher_local_address_on_remote\", \"remote_destination\"]\r\nreturn_route: [\"sender\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming publishers and consumers are properly set up, the response might be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonward_route: [\"bds_publisher_local_address_on_sender\", \"sender\"]\r\nreturn_route: [\"remote_destination\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Stream Client API\r\n\r\nStream client consists of Consumer workers and Publisher workers, which can be set\r\nup to receive/send message to a stream.\r\n\r\nConsumer constantly fetches messages using the stream API.\r\nPublishers send messages using the stream API on demand.\r\n\r\nAssumption is that we can attach additional logic to consumer and publisher either\r\nvia additional workers or functions.\r\n\r\n## Bidirectional stream client API\r\n\r\nBidirectional stream client is implemented on top of Stream Client and implements\r\nadditional message processing for Consumers and Publishers\r\n\r\n### BiDirectional Publisher\r\n\r\nPublisher is a worker, which has a local address. Application workers use publisher\r\naddress to send messages through streams.\r\n\r\nPublisher state contains a stream to send messages to and a return stream to add to\r\nmessage metadata\r\n\r\nWhen handling an ockam message, the publisher encodes the message as binary together\r\nwith return stream and sends it as a stream protocol payload\r\n\r\n### BiDirectional consumer\r\n\r\nBidirectional consumer implements a message handling logic to Stream Consumer\r\n\r\n1. Decode stream payload\r\n1. Ensure return stream publisher exists\r\n1. Add return stream publisher to return route of the message\r\n1. Route message to the onward route on the local node\r\n\r\nTo create return stream publisher, consumer needs to have some sort of registry,\r\nto map return stream to local publisher name\r\n\r\n### Setting up communication\r\n\r\nSERVER:\r\n1. Create consumer for stream \"SERVER_STREAM\"\r\n\r\nCLIENT:\r\n1. Create consumer for stream \"CLIENT_STREAM\"\r\n1. Create publisher for stream \"SERVER_STREAM\" and return stream \"CLIENT_STREAM\"\r\n1. Send messages to through publisher address in the route\r\n\r\n\r\n### Message exchange:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSERVER                       consumer:SERVER   stream_service\r\n | create (subscribe)

regenerated for all changed crates.\r\n- All crates are checked via `cargo check`  and  will fail on problems\r\n- Runs a final `gradle test_rust`.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

precomputed tables for basepoint\nscalar multiplication.</li>\n<li>Fix an unused import.</li>\n<li>Add support for using the <code>zeroize</code> traits with all point types.\nNote that points are not automatically zeroized on Drop, but that\nconsumers of <code>curve25519-dalek</code> should call these methods manually\nwhen
