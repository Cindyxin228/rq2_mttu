[RUSTSEC_2023-0042](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0042) has flagged versions `<0.16.0` as unsound.\r\n\r\nI can update the other dependencies if you think it's worth doing as part of this PR.\r\nI quickly scanned the CHANGELOG and it doesn't seem like you mark dependency updates (other than `embedded-graphics`) so I did not add this change to the log.\r\n\r\n### (edit) Rust MSRV\r\n\r\nIt looks CI is failing because `half v2.3.1` requires Rust version `>= v1.70.0`. Seeing as `jamwaffles` provides the `circleci-embedded-graphics` container with rust version 1.71.1, I've bumped the MSRV to that.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/embedded-graphics/simulator/issues/49/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/embedded-graphics/simulator/issues/49/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
