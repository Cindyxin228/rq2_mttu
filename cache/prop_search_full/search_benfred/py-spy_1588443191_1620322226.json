The error message is printing out, and the py-spy process exits - but this doesn't clean up or kill the profiled python subprocess that py-spy launches. The test is using ```check_output``` https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/blob/c77c5439a2f36051f527a918eb98ccee03422dec/tests/integration_test.py#L41  which waits for all the subprocesses (python script as well as py-spy process) , so it ends up running forever.\r\n\r\nFix by not using std::process::exit, and just returning a normal rust error in this case if we're being asked to profile a process with ```--gil``` and we don't support gil for that version of process (which will hit the process cleanup code).\r\n\r\nFor python 3.9.5 the console output looks like:\r\n```\r\nCannot detect GIL holding in version '3.9.5' on the current platform (reason: unknown pyruntime.gilstate.tstate_current offset)\r\nPlease open an issue in https://github.com/benfred/py-spy with the Python version and

not libpython-based; the latter is inaccessible if deleted... perhaps only\r\npartially accessible via /proc/pid/map_files).\r\n\r\nNote: this depends on https://github.com/rbspy/proc-maps/pull/8

fails.\r\n\r\nWith this PR (and the `proc-maps` fix) I managed to `py-spy dump` Python processes that were started before I upgraded Python on my local box :) (so they now run `/usr/bin/python3.8
