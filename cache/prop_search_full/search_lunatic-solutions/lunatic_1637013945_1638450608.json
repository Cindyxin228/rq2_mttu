The underlaying implementation may change, but I believe that the host functions exposed to the guest should stay mostly the same. This allows us to already start building on top of those APIs while testing the implementation and keep improving the stability and performance of it.\r\n\r\n### Guest\r\n\r\nThere is only one change to the host functions, the addition of `lunatic::process::create_remote_environment`. It works the same as `create_environment `, but expects one more argument, the name of the remote node to create the environment on. Everything else is completely transparent to the user, like spawning processes or message sending.\r\n\r\nThe abstraction of an `Environment` that we used previously to sandbox and limit process resources, fits perfectly into the world of distributed lunatic. Every time you create a new `Environment` you need to explicitly add Wasm `Modules` to it, because we may need to JIT re-compile the module with the new limitations that have been set. Spawning a process from the same function in different `Environments` may use different machine generated code to be more efficient in regards to the provided sandbox. Now that a `Module` may be sent over the network to a computer running a different operating system or even using a different CPU architecture, no changes need to be done on this already existing pattern inside of lunatic.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of using the new API from Rust guest code:\r\n```rust\r\nuse lunatic::{Config, Environment, Mailbox};\r\n\r\n#[lunatic::main]\r\nfn main(_: Mailbox<()>) {\r\n    let mut config = Config::new(0xA00000000, None);\r\n    config.allow_namespace(\"\");\r\n    let mut env = Environment::new_remote(\"foo\", config).unwrap();\r\n    let module = env.add_this_module().unwrap();\r\n\r\n    let _ = module.spawn(|_: Mailbox<()>| println!(\"Hello world\"));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will print out `Hello world` on the node labeled `foo` inside of the cluster. Adding this to the rust library required only a few lines of code changes. The whole implementation complexity stays inside of the VM. From the developer's perspective it's trivial to just send a closure to be executed on a completely different machine.\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\nThere are a few changes to the `lunatic` cli. To start a node you can just run:\r\n```\r\nlunatic --node 0.0.0.0:8333 --node-name foo --no-entry\r\n```\r\nThis starts a lunatic node with the name `foo` on the specified port. The `--no-entry` flag means that this node doesn't have a start function, it will just forever block.\r\n\r\nIf you want to connect to a node you can pass in the `--peer` flag:\r\n```\r\nlunatic --node localhost:8334 --node-name bar --peer 0.0.0.0:8333 file.wasm\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you connect to one node all others will be dynamically discovered. At the moment nodes send plain text messages between each other and each node connects to each other over TCP. In the future I would like to add support for different transport protocols, encryption, flow optimisations, etc. Until now I was mostly focused on developer experience and getting the abstractions right. \r\n\r\nI'm happy with how everything turned out and fitted together. I would also love to hear feedback from the community on what they think about this approach to distributed lunatic.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/72/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 9, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/72/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/71", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/71/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/71/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/71/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/pull/71", "id": 1065965862, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEVCc0c4vH9db", "number": 71, "title": "(docs): update README.md grammar", "user": {"login": "vladdoster", "id": 10052309, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUyMzA5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10052309?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster", "html_url": "https://github.com/vladdoster", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vladdoster/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-11-29T12:13:22Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-29T13:54:10Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-29T13:54:10Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/pulls/71", "html_url": "https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/pull/71", "diff_url": "https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/pull/71.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/pull/71.patch", "merged_at": "2021-11-29T13:54:10Z"}, "body": "- add punctuation where applicable to improve readability\r\n- correct proper pronoun\r\n- remove redundant use of `will`\r\n\r\nCool project -- found via HN on `in-browser CPython`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/71/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/71/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
