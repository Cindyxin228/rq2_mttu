This requires also that the `#[lunatic_test::test]` macro from the [lunatic-test crate](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/rust-lib/tree/high-level-processes/lunatic-test) is used instead of rust's stdlib `#[test]`.\r\n\r\nDifferent from the #92 and #93 PRs, this one doesn't add an additional `lunatic test` command and is not meant to be a general purpose WebAssembly testing system. It's specifically made as a drop in replacement to provide a nice experience to developers that are already familiar with `cargo test`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is the following, if `lunatic` is set as the runner for wasm32 targets in `.cargo/config.toml` it will be used by `cargo` to prefix all the generated .wasm files. E.g. `cargo run` is going to generate a .wasm file from the main.rs entry point and run the app with `lunatic generated-file.wasm`. `cargo test` is going to generated a test .wasm file and invoke it with `lunatic generated-test-file.wasm`.\r\n\r\nBecause the `wasm32` target doesn't support panic catching and the default rust testing logic (`#[test]` macro) heavily depends on it, we can't use it. And [we can't use a different runner for `cargo test`](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-config-toml-different-runner-for-tests/16342). So we are forced during runtime to detect when `cargo test` was invoked and load specifically annotated export functions. In practice this works ok, except some corner cases like `cargo test --example <example-name>`.\r\n\r\n### New `#[lunatic_test::test]` macro\r\n\r\nThe new macro is meant to be used as a drop-in replacement for `#[test]`. It should work together with existing test annotations, like `#[should_panic]` and `#[ignore]`. In case the build target is not `wasm32`, it will fall back to the stdlib `#[test]`. This allows us to easily switch between lunatic's and rust's testing engines by setting the `--target=\"\"` flag on `cargo test`. Here are some examples of it:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/rust-lib/blob/high-level-processes/lunatic-test/tests/panic.rs\r\n* https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/rust-lib/blob/high-level-processes/lunatic-test/tests/failing.rs\r\n\r\n### Supported `cargo test` features\r\n\r\n#### Flags:\r\n\r\n* [x] `--nocapture`\r\n* [x] `--show-output`\r\n* [x] `--ignored`\r\n* [ ] `--include-ignored`\r\n\r\n#### Output:\r\n\r\nRunning `cargo test` with `lunatic` as the runner should produce identical output as the standalone executable. There are some small differences in the color of the output and test function module prefixes. However, most of the info should be preserved, including the ability to show/hide output and automatically displaying output of failed tests.\r\n\r\n**~NOTE: Capturing output of spawned sub-processes is not supported at the moment.~** (now it is)\r\n\r\n#### Filters\r\n\r\nFiltering out tests with `cargo test <filter>` should work as expected. Filtering out integration tests with `cargo test --test <integration_test>` should work as expected.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Running tests in examples with `cargo test --example <example_name>` is not supported**.\r\n\r\n#### Doc tests\r\n\r\nDocumentation tests can't be enabled for the `wasm32` target and are not supported.\r\n\r\n#### Multi-threaded execution\r\n\r\nAll tests are executed in parallel and there is currently no way of limiting the number of concurrent executions.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nI'm satisfied with the result and think that the needs of most unite and integration tests should be cowered with this PR. I think that we should try to iron out all small differences between the test outputs in the future. Then set up a test-suite that will automatically run all combinations of flags and tests to compare lunatic's output to rust's. This would give us confidence that new releases of rust don't break the expected output format.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/101/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/issues/101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
