`ElementBuilder` entrypoints, we avoid an exponential explosion in the size of the resulting Builder object type and thereby dodge limits on mangled symbol size.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be recommending using `v0` name mangling (`RUSTFLAGS=-Csymbol-mangling-version=v0`) but that seems less convenient for users and anyway we should probably avoid generating exponential types in case the compiler takes a peek and gets very sad and slow.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of hard to add an automatic (stress) test for, as testing requires poking the generated `.wasm` file to see if any of the mangled names are looking exponential-ish.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sycamore-rs/sycamore/issues/591/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

**BREAKING**: Use `Cow<str>` instead of `&str` everywhere in `GenericNode`.\r\n- **BREAKING**: Make `from_web_sys` a trait method on `Html`.\r\n- Make the baes view/node macros backend independent and re-export HTML specific macros.\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems like there are a lot of breaking changes, most users won't be affected because these are mostly low-level APIs which are rarely used
