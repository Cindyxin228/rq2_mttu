new constructor function `new_cached` that allows users to create a parser that caches remote content to a local directory. The cache file name is generated using the format `cache-<crc32 of file name>-<file name>`. For example, a remote file located at `http://archive.routeviews.org/route-views.chile/bgpdata/2023.03/RIBS/rib.20230326.0600.bz2` will be cached as `cache-682cb1eb-rib.20230326.0600.bz2` in the cache directory.\r\n\r\nCaching remote content can help reduce network traffic and improve performance, especially when the same remote content is accessed multiple times. The use of a CRC32 hash of the file name in the cache file name ensures that the file name is unique and minimizes collisions.\r\n\r\nRelevant issue: #96 ", "reactions": {"url":

The effect of this bug is that the benchmarks re-download the aforementioned test file regardless of whether the file is already present on the system.\r\n\r\nDue to how easy it is to forget or accidentally provide an incorrect checksum, this pull request also adds code to check the checksums of downloaded files. When a checksum mismatch is found, the downloaded file's computed checksum is printed and the program will error.

`download.sh` was replaced with the module `data_source.rs`. In theory this should work on any platform. Instead of storing files to `/tmp`, files are stored within `target/test_data`. This has the benefit of working in non-unix environments (windows) and means test data will be removed upon running `cargo clean`.\r\n - Test data is downloaded as part of running `cargo bench`. MD5 checksums (calculated via the `md5` crate) are used to check if current test data is up-to-date. If a file is not present or the checksum does not match then the file is downloaded. This should not effect the perceived time to run benchmarks after the initial download and has the added bonus of ensuring that anyone running the benchmarks has the correct version of the test data.\r\n - As part of implementing #12, the benchmark will attempt to search for each BGP parsing program on the system (using the `which` crate). The programs that are found and their respective paths are printed before the benchmark begins. Benchmarks are grouped by the data file being read so they will be compared on the same page within criterion's generated reports.\r\n - To more fairly compare `bgpkit-parser` against other programs, the `bgpkit-parser` executable is used instead of directly calling into the library. Despite the increased overhead of calling a separate executable, `bgpkit-parser` has still managed to beat `bgpdump` in every benchmark I have done. Using the executable is possible because Cargo treats benchmarks and tests placed within the `benches` and `tests` folders separate from the `src` directory as integration tests. To support integration tests/benchmarks, all binary targets are built prior to starting. In the case of benches, binary targets are built in release mode.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- While I included all of the programs listed under #12, I only tested it with `bgpkit-parser` and `bgpdump`. In theory it should work automatically when those additional tools are installed to the system, but it may need some tweaks for the exact command line arguments.\r\n- Are there any smaller table dump test files available than `rib-example.bz2`? `bgpdump` takes an extremely long time to go through this file. By criterion's estimate, it would take a full hour on my machine to collect the minimum 10 samples required and I did not want to wait that long.", "reactions": {"url":

This messes up the parsing of the remaining bytes.\r\n\r\nThe route-views5's RIB dump encoding is correct in this example.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nInstead of we parse prefix based on whether it has `add_path` (`let prefix = input.read_nlri_prefix(&afi, add_path)?;`), we change it to always only parse length and prefix based on RFC 6396 (`let prefix = input.read_nlri_prefix(&afi, false)?;`).\r\n\r\nThis fixes issue #67.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/68/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/68/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/65", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/65/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/65/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/65/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/pull/65", "id": 1299841098, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGRDI1M47Jjl7", "number": 65, "title": "Support RFC9234", "user": {"login": "digizeph", "id": 659667, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTY2Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659667?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph", "html_url": "https://github.com/digizeph", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/digizeph/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-07-10T06:23:34Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-23T23:38:14Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-23T22:26:55Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/pulls/65", "html_url": "https://github.com/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/pull/65", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/pull/65.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/pull/65.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-23T22:26:55Z"}, "body": "This pull request adds support for parsing BGP Attribute 35 (OnlyToCustomer attribute) from [RFC9234][rfc9234].\r\n\r\n[rfc9234]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9234.html#name-bgp-only-to-customer-otc-at", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/65/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bgpkit/bgpkit-parser/issues/65/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
