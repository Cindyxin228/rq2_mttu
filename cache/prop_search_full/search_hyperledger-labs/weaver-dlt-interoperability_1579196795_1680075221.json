This meant that <code>rustc</code> was not checking the\nborrows for <code>bumpalo::collections::IntoIter</code> and this could result in\nuse-after-free bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>3.11.0</h2>\n<p>Released 2022-08-17.</p>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for per-<code>Bump</code> allocation limits.
