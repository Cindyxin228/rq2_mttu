The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.\n\n##### Breaking Changes\n\n-   The Codecov Action runs as a `node20` action due to `node16` deprecation. See [this post from GitHub](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/) on how to migrate.\n-   Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This [doc](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions) shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.\n-   OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our [CLI download page](https://cli.codecov.io)\n-   Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs\n\n`v3` versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n-
