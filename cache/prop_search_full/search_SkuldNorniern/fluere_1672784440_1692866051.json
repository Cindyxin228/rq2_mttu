It also implements proper log level handling and follows the conventional commit rule for the commit message title. The changes are made without using any external crate.\n\n## Summary\n- Modified the `new()` function in the `Log` struct to create a log file using the standard library's `std::fs::File::create()` function.\n- Conditionally compiled code based on the target OS using the `#[cfg(target_os = \"~\")]` attribute. The log file is created at `/var/log/fluere/` for Linux, at the installation directory for Windows, and at the appropriate directories for MacOS and BSD.\n- Modified the `log()` function in the `Log` struct to handle different log levels. Implemented a match statement to handle different log levels and write the appropriate log messages to the log file.\n- Used the `std::io::Write` trait's `write()` function to write log messages to the log file. Handled any errors that may occur during file IO.\n\nPlease review and merge this PR. Thank you!\n\nFixes #31.\n\n---\nTo checkout this PR branch, run the following command in your terminal:\n```zsh\ngit checkout {pull_request.branch_name}\n```\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Latest mprovements to Sweep:\n* Getting Sweep to format before committing!
