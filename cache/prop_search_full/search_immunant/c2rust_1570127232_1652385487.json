But don't give up all hope for cleaning up your unsafe c2rust-generated Rust code--good things may show up on this front in the future.\r\n- Comments are no longer preserved in translated code. This is not a permanent change (expect a follow-up PR to reintroduce comments in most AST positions), but comment translation has to be implemented in a substantially different way when using syn+prettyplease for AST generation and pretty-printing, and this is still WIP.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/immunant/c2rust/issues/374/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
