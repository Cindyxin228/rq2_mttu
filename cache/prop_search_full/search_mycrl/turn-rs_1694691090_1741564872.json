There are some problems with this, if the external system is slow to respond, this will block the current thread's udp packet processing process, although there are multiple threads, but if each thread is waiting, then the server will be stuck, which is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nSo, in version 3.4, the hooks api was removed, no interaction with the outside is generated, and udp uses a single thread to process messages, which will improve throughput performance most of the time.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the driver isn't really necessary, as it's purely an HTTP interface, so there's not much need to have to maintain a driver.\r\n\r\n# Change\r\n\r\n- Remove the HTTP hooks interface.\r\n- UDP packet processing uses a single thread.\r\n- Events are pushed to the client via SSE.\r\n- Remove the password from the api session information.\r\n- mimalloc went from optional to always used.\r\n- No more separate crates for turn and stun.\r\n- Overall project editor upgrade to 2024.\r\n-
