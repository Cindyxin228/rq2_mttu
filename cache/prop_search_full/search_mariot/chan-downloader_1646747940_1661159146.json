This is possible to do using 4chan and 4pleb's API. I gave an example of each of their API links for ease of reference when this does end up getting added.\r\n\r\nIf there is something you don't like you can take/modify whatever it is that you want, I just figured I'd help as much as I can.\r\n\r\nThis closes [mariot/chan-downloader#15](https://github.com/mariot/chan-downloader/issues/15)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mariot/chan-downloader/issues/16/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mariot/chan-downloader/issues/16/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
