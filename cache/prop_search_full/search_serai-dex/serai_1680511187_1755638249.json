The payment ID is tied to an output received by the subaddress account that spent Monero in the tx (i.e. a self-spend).\r\n2.

would have a different number of elements than required.\r\n\r\nThis isn't an issue for current txs as from [hf 12 Monero requires all inputs to have the same number of decoys
