The cleanest way to do this seemed to be to pass in the StreamDescription to `handle_response` in the same way it's done in `build` (which is trivial to do from the execution layer), so I updated the Operation trait to include that in the signature.

so I handled each of those places (along with cascading changes due to other places related to that code) in a separate commit to make it easier to follow along with each one. The final commit removes the Arc and the Clone derive from the Error type. Because of this, I think the easier way to review this PR is to review each commit separately so that all of the different unrelated changes don't make things confusing. I'll push a separate commit for each change that's suggested during review, and then once everything looks okay, I'll rebase to move each change into the commit associated with the part that changed and request one final review to make sure that all of the changes look okay after that rebase.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/301/reactions",

Note that a significant portion of the diff is the unified tests runner, which I squashed in from #249. I plan to keep this PR up to date as that PR progresses.\r\n\r\nTodo list\r\n- [x] Allow declaring an API version in a language idiomatic matter\r\n- [x] Submit declared API version fields with every command\r\n- [x] Figure out where to append Versioned API fields to command\r\n- [x] Format code according to style guide\r\n- [x] Verify correct behaviour using spec tests\r\n- [x] Provide easier way to create `ApiVersion`\r\n\r\nSee below for notes about open issues in the list above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Figure out where to append versioned API fields\r\n\r\nI initially planned to append the Versioned API fields in `Client::execute_operation_on_connection`, but realised that this is only used when running commands that are part of an operation. Other commands, such as `isMaster` or all authentication commands are not run through this path, which makes this unfeasible.\r\nThe common code point would be `Message::with_command`, which will have to receive the declared API version from the connection that the message is being sent on. This has two downsides: instead of only keeping the API version declared on the client, we need to pass it down through connection options. Furthermore, since command monitoring is hooked into `Client::execute_operation_on_connection` instead of `Connection::send_command`, we need to manually append Versioned API fields to command documents for command monitoring. I'm not particularly happy about this as I'd like to keep the logic as contained as possible, but with `Connection::send_command` being used in multiple places I feel that passing the declared API version as part of the command is not feasible. I'm happy about any ideas how to best implement this.\r\n\r\n### Format code\r\n\r\nWill be done at the end - please forgive me for visually butchering the language.\r\n\r\n### Spec tests\r\n\r\nWhile the unified test runner POC is being worked on, not all tests may pass. Currently it fails to compare command objects, but I haven't investigated any further aside from making sure that the Versioned API fields appear as expected.\r\nDue to this driver not implementing the transaction spec, the transaction tests will be verified using the second POC driver.\r\n\r\n### Easier API for ApiVersion\r\n\r\nThe API version is currently declared as follows:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut options = ClientOptions::parse_uri(uri, None).await.unwrap();\r\noptions.server_api = ServerApi {\r\n    version: ServerApiVersion::Version1,\r\n    strict: None,\r\n    deprecation_errors: None,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feels cumbersome, as users are required to pass values for `strict` and `deprecation_errors` explicitly, even when they want to rely on the default. A factory would be useful, but I'm not sure what an idiomatic factory in Rust would look like. Following options come to mind:\r\n```rust\r\n// Variant 1: Factory to create ServerApi object from string, set other fields directly:\r\nlet mut server_api = ServerApi::from_string(\"1\");\r\nserver_api.strict = true;\r\nserver_api.deprecation_errors = true;\r\n\r\n// Variant 2: Have methods to modify initially created object\r\nlet server_api = ServerApi::from_string(\"1\");\r\n// Example: enable strict mode and deprecation errors directly\r\nlet server_api = ServerApi::from_string(\"1\").strict(true).deprecation_errors(true);\r\n```",
