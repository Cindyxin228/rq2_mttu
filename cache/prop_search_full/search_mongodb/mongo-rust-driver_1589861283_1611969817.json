Note that a significant portion of the diff is the unified tests runner, which I squashed in from #249. I plan to keep this PR up to date as that PR progresses.\r\n\r\nTodo list\r\n- [x] Allow declaring an API version in a language idiomatic matter\r\n- [x] Submit declared API version fields with every command\r\n- [x] Figure out where to append Versioned API fields to command\r\n- [x] Format code according to style guide\r\n- [x] Verify correct behaviour using spec tests\r\n- [x] Provide easier way to create `ApiVersion`\r\n\r\nSee below for notes about open issues in the list above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Figure out where to append versioned API fields\r\n\r\nI initially planned to append the Versioned API fields in `Client::execute_operation_on_connection`, but realised that this is only used when running commands that are part of an operation. Other commands, such as `isMaster` or all authentication commands are not run through this path, which makes this unfeasible.\r\nThe common code point would be `Message::with_command`, which will have to receive the declared API version from the connection that the message is being sent on. This has two downsides: instead of only keeping the API version declared on the client, we need to pass it down through connection options. Furthermore, since command monitoring is hooked into `Client::execute_operation_on_connection` instead of `Connection::send_command`, we need to manually append Versioned API fields to command documents for command monitoring. I'm not particularly happy about this as I'd like to keep the logic as contained as possible, but with `Connection::send_command` being used in multiple places I feel that passing the declared API version as part of the command is not feasible. I'm happy about any ideas how to best implement this.\r\n\r\n### Format code\r\n\r\nWill be done at the end - please forgive me for visually butchering the language.\r\n\r\n### Spec tests\r\n\r\nWhile the unified test runner POC is being worked on, not all tests may pass. Currently it fails to compare command objects, but I haven't investigated any further aside from making sure that the Versioned API fields appear as expected.\r\nDue to this driver not implementing the transaction spec, the transaction tests will be verified using the second POC driver.\r\n\r\n### Easier API for ApiVersion\r\n\r\nThe API version is currently declared as follows:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut options = ClientOptions::parse_uri(uri, None).await.unwrap();\r\noptions.server_api = ServerApi {\r\n    version: ServerApiVersion::Version1,\r\n    strict: None,\r\n    deprecation_errors: None,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feels cumbersome, as users are required to pass values for `strict` and `deprecation_errors` explicitly, even when they want to rely on the default. A factory would be useful, but I'm not sure what an idiomatic factory in Rust would look like. Following options come to mind:\r\n```rust\r\n// Variant 1: Factory to create ServerApi object from string, set other fields directly:\r\nlet mut server_api = ServerApi::from_string(\"1\");\r\nserver_api.strict = true;\r\nserver_api.deprecation_errors = true;\r\n\r\n// Variant 2: Have methods to modify initially created object\r\nlet server_api = ServerApi::from_string(\"1\");\r\n// Example: enable strict mode and deprecation errors directly\r\nlet server_api = ServerApi::from_string(\"1\").strict(true).deprecation_errors(true);\r\n```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/266/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/266/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/265", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/265/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/265/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/265/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/265", "id": 728575155, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTA5MjYwNDAw", "number": 265, "title": "RUST-576 Fix count_documents fails when writeConcern set on Collection", "user": {"login": "patrickfreed", "id": 936020, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjAyMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/936020?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed", "html_url": "https://github.com/patrickfreed", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-10-23T22:52:42Z", "updated_at": "2020-11-10T23:54:21Z", "closed_at": "2020-11-10T23:54:20Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pulls/265", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/265", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/265.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/265.patch", "merged_at": "2020-11-10T23:54:20Z"}, "body": "RUST-576\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where `count_documents` would return an error if called on a client that had a write concern set.

"RUST-556\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a POC of the maxConnecting requirement of the \"Avoiding Connection Storms\" project. In doing so, it also re-architects the connection pool to use a channel based WaitQueue rather than semaphore based one. This was done to allow for easier and more effective maintenance of the wait queue now that we need to support arbitrary conditions for exiting the queue (e.g. maxConnecting). \r\n\r\nI realize that a rewrite of this magnitude typically goes through a design phase, so I apologize for suddenly dropping it like this. I decided it was the preferable choice for this POC largely because a counting semaphore wait queue was frustrating to extend to use in this case, and that this lockless + channel-based pattern is a [much more common aproach in the async world for accessing shared state](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.22/tokio/sync/index.html#mpsc-channel) than our previous lock heavy one. Maintaining the old pool and adding support for maxConnecting would introduce even _more_ locking while also producing a suboptimal solution (impossible or difficult to ensure fairness with multiple semaphores/locks in this case), so this seemed like an good time for a rewrite. Additionally, this is a proof-of-concept after all, so I figured it would be a good time to proof-of-concept what an idiomatic async pool would look like too. I think that I should have opted for a pool like this back when I originally converted the old pool to async, but I was lacking in experience with async patterns at the time. Ironically, the original sync pool with its queue of condvars was somewhat similar to this one.\r\n\r\n## Overview of new pool\r\n\r\nI'll give a brief overview of the layout of the new pool here to make digesting the actual code a little easier. We have the same clonable `ConnectionPool` type as before with the same functionality; however, when we create a new pool, instead of creating a `ConnectionPoolInner` type that is arc'd and wrapping that, we start a worker task (`ConnectionPoolWorker`) that opens up a few different channels, and we store senders to those channels (`ConnectionRequester`, `PoolManager`) on the `ConnectionPool`. The worker task is in charge of all changes and access to the connection pool state; to do anything with the pool, a you need to send a request via one of the two senders mentioned before. To check out a connection for example, a thread sends a `ConnectionRequest` via a `ConnectionRequester` and waits for the worker to respond. To perform any other pool interactions (e.g. clearing, checking in), a thread uses the `PoolManager` to send the appropriate requests. The `ConnectionRequesters` act like strong references to the pool in that they keep the worker alive until they are all dropped, whereas `PoolManagers` are like weak references and can still be in scope when the worker ceases execution. A `ConnectionPool` instance holds onto both a `ConnectionRequester` and a `PoolManager`, but a `Connection` for example only holds on to a `PoolManager` in order to check itself back in. Instead of having a separate background task for ensuring minPoolSize, the worker task just takes care of that.\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n- `ConnectionPoolInner` gone, replaced with a background worker task `ConnectionPoolWorker` that has exclusive access to pool state\r\n- `ConnectionPoolWorker` listens on a few channels for incoming requests, responding to them as necessary\r\n- Threads can check out connections via `ConnectionRequester`s. The `ConnectionPoolWorker` quits once all the requesters are dropped\r\n- Threads can modify the pool state via `PoolManager`s. These do _not_ keep the worker running and may no-op if outlive the worker.\r\n- `Connection`s use `PoolManager`s to check themselves back in\r\n\r\n### Some notes\r\nGiven this architecture, it was trivially easy to introduce maxConnecting: we simply don't poll the `ConnectionRequestReceiver` when the pool is empty and has too many pending connections. The actual changes required to implement that part are all in the last few commits or so. Additionally, we now have a context which always has exclusive access to the pool state, making it much easier to reason about. Lastly, the `drop` implementations of the various connection types have been simplified with the removal of `ConnectionPoolInner` and `DroppedConnectionState`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/259/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/259/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/258", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/258/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/258/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/258/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/258", "id": 712339724, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk1ODM3OTM1", "number": 258, "title": "RUST-565 Properly report connection closures due to error", "user": {"login": "patrickfreed", "id": 936020, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjAyMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/936020?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed", "html_url": "https://github.com/patrickfreed", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-09-30T23:12:15Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-21T17:49:59Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-21T17:49:59Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pulls/258", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/258", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/258.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/258.patch", "merged_at": "2020-10-21T17:49:59Z"}, "body": "RUST-565\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where connection closure events emitted due to errors never contained the `ConnectionClosedReason::Error` as a reason.

OCSP client verification is not currently implemented in `rustls` (see: https://github.com/ctz/rustls/issues/31), so any test which requires the driver to fail creating a connection will not pass.\r\n\r\nAccording to the spec, we are [required to document](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/ocsp-support/ocsp-support.rst#documentation-requirements) that such verification is not implemented. I didn't write this documentation yet since I wasn't sure if we were going to go ahead and try to implement these features anyways. If we think that won't be for a while then I can go ahead and write it now.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the tests will always be failing, I was wondering if we should just park this on a separate branch or
