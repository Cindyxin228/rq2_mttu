"RUST-1103\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new benchmarks: find many (raw BSON) and find many (serde struct). It also updates the multi export benchmark to use raw BSON, resulting in a speedup.\r\n\r\nI didn't include any new versions of the find one by id benchmark, since using raw BSON didn't actually change anything there. I believe this is due to the test being bottlenecked by network I/O rather than BSON serialization. \r\n\r\nI also didn't include any borrowed deserialization benchmarks for any case, since it also didn't make any noticeable difference. I think we'd need to use a data set that has documents much larger than the tweet one provided with the microbenchmarks.\r\n\r\nLastly, I didn't update the multi-import benchmark to use raw documents, since it currently doesn't result in a speedup due to RUST-1132.\r\n\r\nexample patch: https://evergreen.mongodb.com/version/61bbc5421e2d177b9452baf4\r\n\r\nSome numbers from my machine:\r\n| benchmark                | median iteration time |\r\n|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|\r\n| find many (Document)     | 0.166s                |\r\n| find many (raw BSON)     | 0.022s                |\r\n| find many (serde struct) | 0.068s                |\r\n| find many (C, raw BSON)            | 0.019                 |\r\n| find many (Go, raw BSON)           | 0.012                 |\r\n| find many (Go, bson.M)   | 0.366                 |\r\n\r\nSo overall, performance is quite good (especially serde struct, which used to be 0.15ish but improved due to the internal use of `RawDocumentBuf`), but we are a bit slower than Go and C in the raw BSON case. This is likely due to extra copies incurred by going through `serde` and could be avoided, but it didn't seem like a high enough priority to focus on now.", "reactions": {"url":

From initial benchmarking, these cursors are _really_ fast, nearly C fast. Furthermore, users can now perform borrowed deserialization from the values retrieved from these cursors, which seems to be much faster than owned deserialization. I filed a follow up ticket for creating benchmarks for these cases to ensure we have an actual measurement of the performance differences.\r\n\r\nIt also seems that regular `Document` cursors may have been sped up by this change, though it's not immediately clear why. My guess is that we stopped using `#[serde(flatten)]`, which may be doing extra copies under the hood.\r\n\r\nNote that the way this is implemented involves copying the results, so it's not truly zero-copy (the deserialization part from `RawDocumentBuf` to `T` can be, but iterating the cursor involves copies). I opted for this more straightforward path after doing some benchmarking that showed a true-zero-copy approach netted very little benefit when doing no deserialization at all and essentially zero benefit when doing borrowed deserialization.

provides support for [causal consistency](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/causal-consistency/causal-consistency.rst).\r\n\r\nThe change that is needed to support causally consistent sessions is that `readConcern.afterClusterTime` now needs to be included in all commands that are part of a causally consistent session that take a `readConcern`.  `readConcern.afterClusterTime` must be set to the `operationTime` field of the `ClientSession` struct (initialized to `None`).  The `operationTime` field of the `ClientSession` struct must get updated to the `operationTime` field of the server's response to any command that is part of a causally consistent session (this field is included on success or error).\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty is that `readConcern.level` now is not always included when `readConcern` is included.  To address that I introduced a new type `readConcernInternal` that takes the role of `readConcern` in certain cases (when `level` is optional).  \r\n\r\nCurrently there is a bug in this implementation where there are duplicate `readConcern` fields being included.  Most likely this is because the readConcern in `FindOptions` (for example) and the `readConcern` that is set on the session are both being serialized.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/493/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/492", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/492/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/492/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/issues/492/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/492", "id": 1026809272, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCvnhg84tOLDy", "number": 492, "title": "minor: add snippets for connecting with sync API and x509 authentication", "user": {"login": "patrickfreed", "id": 936020, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjAyMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/936020?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed", "html_url": "https://github.com/patrickfreed", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrickfreed/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-10-14T20:50:55Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-18T17:37:56Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-18T17:37:56Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pulls/492", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/492", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/492.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/pull/492.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-18T17:37:56Z"}, "body": "This PR adds a few connection examples for connecting with the sync API and also or connecting with x509 authentication.

Option<Database>\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think make `default_database(&self)` returned an `Option<Database>` is easiler to use.  And the behavior is more matches for the function name.\r\n\r\nIf user want to get default database name, we can get it from `ClientOptions.default_database`, or using something like `client.default_database().unwrap().name()`.\r\n\r\nMaybe something is missing, any review suggestion is appreciated :-)", "reactions": {"url":
