types.\r\n\r\ne.g. the following is now possible:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]\r\nstruct MyData<'a> {\r\n    name: &'a str,\r\n\r\n    #[serde(borrow)]\r\n    binary: RawBinary<'a>,\r\n\r\n    #[serde(borrow)]\r\n    doc: &'a RawDocument,\r\n\r\n    #[serde(borrow)]\r\n    some_field: RawBson<'a>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementations behave as follows:\r\n- `&RawDocument`:\r\n  - for human readable formats: iterate over document and serialize each kvp\r\n  - for binary formats: serialize the document as a newtype around a slice of bytes.\r\n      - The BSON serializers handle this by interpreting the name of the newtype\r\n  - Open Question: should this use something like `{ \"$rawBsonDocument\": <bytes> }` for binary, non-BSON formats? This will allow `RawBson` to round trip, but that's about it.\r\n- `RawDocumentBuf`: same as `RawDocument`. In a future PR it will be able to deserialize from arbitrary maps, but that requires the ability to append.\r\n- `RawBson`:\r\n  - Defer to the wrapped type\r\n   - The types that map directly to the serde data model (e.g. integers) are deserialized as-is, similar to `Bson`.\r\n    - For everything else, the extended JSON serde data model equivalent is used, also similar to `Bson`\r\n        - for many types, the model needed to be changed a little bit to ensure to extra allocations are done\r\n- `&RawArray`\r\n  - Same as `&RawDocument`, but uses a different newtype name to signal an array.\r\n- `RawJavaScriptCodeWithScope`\r\n  - serialize to/from: `{ \"$code\": <borrowed string>, \"$scope\": <borrowed string> }`\r\n- `RawDbPointer`\r\n  - serialize to/from: `{ \"$ref\": <borrowed string>, \"$id\": <objectid> }`\r\n- `ObjectId`\r\n  - Same as before, but it can now also deserialize from `{ \"$oid\": <12 byte slice> }`\r\n- `RawBinary`\r\n  - On human readable platforms, serializes to ext JSON format in serde data model\r\n  - On binary formats, serializes to `{ \"$binary\": { \"bytes\": <borrowed bytes>, subType: <u8> } }` in the serde data model\r\n  - In both cases, the corresponding serializer handles it and correctly encodes as BSON\r\n  - In order for `RawBinary` to round trip on non-BSON formats, the separate bytes model (rather than base64 string model) was required. It is also much faster.\r\n  - Unfortunately, we can't also update `Binary` to exhibit this behavior, as it would technically be a breaking change.\r\n- `RawRegex`:\r\n  - serialize to/from extended JSON format but uses borrowed instead of owned strings\r\n- `DateTime`: updated to also deserialize from `{ \"$date\": <i64> }` to avoid a string allocation during deserialization.\r\n", "reactions":

This type requires no feature flags to be used, though the existing flag can be enabled to allow for easy conversion between it and `uuid::Uuid` (similar to `bson::DateTime`).\r\n\r\nAs part of this, I updated the UUID spec implementation to operate on the new `bson::Uuid` type rather than `uuid::Uuid`, and as a result, was able to move that out from behind a feature flag too. Since these methods haven't been included in a release yet, this isn't a breaking change.\r\n\r\nWhen serialized/deserializing from other formats, I opted to have `bson::Uuid` use `uuid::Uuid`'s implementation, rather than sticking with extended JSON (unlike `bson::DateTime`). Based on past experience, I think users will prefer this, but let me know if this doesn't seem like the right choice.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/311#issuecomment-940421299

make the conversions between it and `chrono::DateTime` and `std::SystemTime` more obvious / easier to use, as well as to make it more functional on its own. To allow us to make these changes without the fear of polluting the API with old versions of `chrono`, any methods interacting with `chrono` were moved behind the feature flag `\"chrono-0_4\"`. For consistency, the same was done for `uuid`.\r\n\r\nSummary of the new methods:\r\n- `DateTime::now`\r\n- `DateTime::from_millis`\r\n- `DateTime::from_chrono` \r\n- `DateTime::to_chrono`\r\n  - the `to_chrono` and `from_chrono` naming takes inspiration from tokio's [`from_std`](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.6.0/tokio/fs/struct.File.html#method.from_std)\r\n- `DateTime::from_system_time` \r\n- `DateTime::to_system_time`\r\n\r\nNotably, the following were _not_ included:\r\n- `DateTime::as_chrono(&self) -> &chrono::DateTime`\r\n  - This was not added because it can only be implemented if the inner value is in fact a `chrono::DateTime`. However, `chrono::DateTime` doesn't support the full range of `i64` milliseconds from the Unix epoch, which BSON does support (RUST-799). This means that there could be a situation where valid data resides in a MongoDB deployment that the Rust driver could not read (pymongo has this issue, see [PYTHON-1824](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-1824)). To fix this issue, the interior value of `DateTime` was updated to be an `i64` to match BSON, meaning this helper could not be implemented.\r\n- `impl AsRef<chrono::DateTime> for crate::DateTime`\r\n  - same reasoning as the previous one\r\n- `impl Deref<chrono::DateTime> for `crate::DateTime`\r\n  - same reasoning as before\r\n  - `crate::DateTime` is also not a smart pointer type, and the Rust API guidelines recommend that exclusively smart pointer types implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` ([C-DEREF](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/predictability.html#c-deref))\r\n\r\nIn a related change, I noticed that our ISO-8601 string helpers weren't actually adhering to ISO-8601 (see RUST-825). This was fixed, and the helpers were renamed to be a bit more explicit about the standards they work with.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/258/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/258/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/257", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/257/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/257/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/257/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust/pull/257", "id": 896479218, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjQ4NTgyMjQ2", "number": 257, "title": "RUST-815 Truncate to millisecond precision in `bson::DateTime`'s `From<chrono::DateTime>`", "user": {"login": "vkill", "id": 610852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/610852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill", "html_url": "https://github.com/vkill", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vkill/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2546110148, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ2MTEwMTQ4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/labels/tracked-in-jira", "name": "tracked-in-jira", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Ticket filed in Mongo's Jira system"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-05-20T08:32:05Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-24T20:23:08Z", "closed_at": "2021-05-24T20:23:08Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/pulls/257", "html_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust/pull/257", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust/pull/257.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust/pull/257.patch", "merged_at": "2021-05-24T20:23:08Z"}, "body": "Hi, there\r\n\r\nThe auto remove microseconds and nanoseconds feature was removed from This [commit](https://github.com/mongodb/bson-rust/commit/8a92a568ba9de1192e8fb4217ae541c98b335cad#diff-d6adfba5b9892574146927e3f707649f3b601313211502ff5ae3c796f83dcee4L160).

(This is also why the PR build will fail for now). However, renaming the existing function would be a breaking change. How would we deal with this?\r\n\r\n- I marked the existing function as deprecated, I assume this would need an additional version argument. The function could also be removed altogether of course, since it was moved into the newly created module.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
