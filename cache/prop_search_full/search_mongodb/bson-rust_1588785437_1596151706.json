errors\" and \"parse errors\" sections of the BSON corpus spec tests.\r\n\r\nAs part of implementing the parse tests, there ended up being far more changes (both in implementation and API) than I would have liked, but I believe they were all necessary. The changes stem from the fact that our current extJSON parser would not fail if extJSON wasn't formatted properly--it would just parse it as a document. The spec's indicate we should actually reject such inputs, which required adding failability to all the extJSON parsing mechanisms (`From<Value> for Bson => TryFrom<Value> for Bson`).\r\n\r\nTo implement these changes, I started by trying to modify `from_extended_document` to shake the boat as little as possible, but I quickly realized that doing the error checking there would require a ton of boilerplate. I instead opted to leverage `serde` as much as possible by defining models for the various extJSON representations of things, while still leaving `from_extended_document` around so as to not break the `serde` implementation.\r\n\r\nFrom an API perspective, I needed a new error type for extJSON parsing errors. To that end, I added an `extjson` and `extjson::de` module to house that type. In the future, I think we could add further generic functions for extJSON deserialization/serialization in there too.", "reactions": {"url":

`ElementType` enum cases to be more consistent with each other, with other MongoDB drivers, and with the Rust ecosystem as a whole, in that order of priority.\r\n\r\nThe names were chosen according to the following guidelines: What other drivers have settled on calling the various types defines the name of the \"BSON type\". From there, if there is a Rust type (including from popular community libraries) that shares a name with that type, name the case according to that. \r\n\r\nFor instance, all drivers refer to what we used to call `Bson::FloatingPoint` as a \"Double\", which de-facto makes the name of the \"BSON type\" \"Double\". Since there is no Rust \"double\" type, we simply name the enum case `Bson::Double`. For regular expression, there is a popular `regex` crate which names the type `Regex`, so we name the case `Bson::Regex`. The same goes for `Bson::I32` and `Bson::I64`.\r\n\r\nChanges to `Bson`:\r\n- `FloatingPoint` -> `Double`\r\n- `Utf8String` -> `String`\r\n- `Boolean` -> `Bool`\r\n- `TimeStamp` -> `Timestamp` (timestamp is rarely if ever camelCased)\r\n- `UtcDatetime` -> `DateTime` (`chrono::DateTime` uses camelCase)\r\n\r\nIn the next step, I made sure each `ElementType` case shared the same name with its' corresponding `Bson` case:\r\n- `FloatingPoint` -> `Double`\r\n- `Utf8String` -> `String`\r\n- `Boolean` -> `Bool`\r\n- `UtcDatetime` -> `DateTime`\r\n- `NullValue` -> `Null`\r\n- `RegularExpression` -> `Regex`\r\n- `Integer32Bit` -> `I32`\r\n- `TimeStamp` -> `Timestamp`\r\n- `Integer64Bit` -> `I64`\r\n- `Decimal128Bit` -> `Decimal128`\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that I did not rename `ElementType::EmbeddedDocument`, since a top level document by definition does not have an element type, since it isn't an element. Let me know if this should just be `Document` to reduce confusion.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/bson-rust/issues/164/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
