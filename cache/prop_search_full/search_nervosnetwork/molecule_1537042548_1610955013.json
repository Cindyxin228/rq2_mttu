can change the internal logic more easily.\r\n- Why I rename a lot of variables?\r\n  - At first, I wanted to use `serde` on `ast::verified::Ast` directly, so changed their names for readability. (But I met a lot of problems, I removed those code)\r\n  - Too many variables have same names (`inner`, `typ`, and so on), lots of them are `String`, it brought a lot of troubles (when I did typos, for example: `inner().typ()` and `.typ()`).\r\n- At present, there all three set of structs look like each others: `ast::raw::Ast`, `ast::verified::Ast`, `ir::Ir`. (I tried to merge `ast::verified::Ast` and `ir::Ir`, but failed, and it wasted me a lot of time.)\r\n  - After parsing a schema file, we get `ast::raw::Ast`.\r\n  - After checking the `ast::raw::Ast`, we get `ast::verified::Ast`.\r\n  - `ir::Ir` is used between compiler and compiler plugins, it can be convert with `ast::verified::Ast`.\r\n- **Generated code is not changed in this PR.**", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/16/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/16/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/13", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/13/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/13/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/13/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/pull/13", "id": 541883696, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU2NDM1ODE2", "number": 13, "title": "feat: rust support `#![no_std]`", "user": {"login": "chaoticlonghair", "id": 30993023, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkzMDIz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30993023?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaoticlonghair", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chaoticlonghair/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-12-23T19:53:51Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-27T07:07:43Z", "closed_at": "2019-12-31T06:18:14Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/molecule/pulls/13", "html_url": "https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/pull/13", "diff_url": "https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/pull/13.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/pull/13.patch", "merged_at": "2019-12-31T06:18:14Z"}, "body": "### Brief\r\n\r\nAt first, I try to do just few changes on #12, but after a lot of tests, I think there are lots of things could be remove or update in that PR, so I use the master branch as my base branch and implement it in another way.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThe reasons why I didn't just approve that PR or just updated from that PR:\r\n\r\n- The test for `no-std` in that PR (`examples/nostd-tests`) didn't work correctly.\r\n\r\n  Reason:\r\n  - `std` is the default feature for `molecule`.\r\n  - `codegen` is dependent on `molecule`.\r\n  - `build.rs` for `examples/nostd-tests` is dependent on `molecule`.\r\n  - Since rust had compiled the moleculewith `feature = \"std\"`, it will use the molecule with `feature = \"std\"`, even though we had written the `default-features = false` in `Cargo.toml`.\r\n  - So, at last, `examples/nostd-tests` is dependent on `molecule`with `feature = \"std\"`, not `no-std`.\r\n  - [A simple example is HERE (CLICK TO DOWNLOAD).](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/files/3995975/example.zip)\r\n\r\n  References:\r\n  - [Cargo Issue-5730: Features of dependencies are enabled if they're enabled in build-dependencies; breaks no_std libs](../../../rust-lang/cargo/issues/5730#)\r\n  - [Cargo Issue-4866: build-dependencies and dependencies should not have features unified](../../../rust-lang/cargo/issues/4866#)\r\n  - [Cargo Issue-4463: Feature selection in workspace depends on the set of packages compiled](../../../rust-lang/cargo/issues/4463#)\r\n\r\n- The code for test can be reusable, coping more than 350 lines is unnecessary (could be controlled by features).\r\n\r\n- Since `Builder::write()` for `no-std` couldn't throw errors, that PR remove the return `Result` from function signature, so we can't handle the errors for some scenes with `std`.\r\n\r\n  I just keep the function signature as previous, and I use `Result<(), std::io::Error>` for `std` and `Result<(), NeverType>` for `no-std` ([`NeverType` haven't released in lastest `Rust`, so I use `core::convert::Infallible` temporarily](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/convert/enum.Infallible.html#future-compatibility)).\r\n\r\n- Threads is not supported in `no-std`, so we don't have to use `bytes`.\r\n  (`bytes::Bytes::slice(..)` is significantly slower than `&slice[..]` or `&vector[..]`, I have ran benchmark for getters 3 month ago.)\r\n\r\n  I use a new type of `Vec<u8>` for `no-std`.\r\n\r\n  It will cost more memory if we use `Entity` to access fields or items (since it will clone a part of memory), but we can just use the `Reader`to instead of.\r\n  The `Reader` is significantly more effective no matter the `Entity` is base on `Vec<u8>` or `bytes::Bytes`.\r\n\r\n  And we can remove almost all dependencies to reduce the size of the binary.\r\n  For the `ci-tests/src/main.rs`: `411K -> 371K: 10%` (`release`, `debug=false`, `lto=true`, `codegen-units=1`, `strip`).\r\n\r\n- We don't have to upgrade `bytes`. (We can do it later. )\r\n\r\n  **TODO**: We can use a feature to support `thread-safe Entity` for `no-std`(**someday**).\r\n\r\n- I disagree to introduce `failure` because of the same reason as above (unnecessary dependency and smaller binary for `no-std`).\r\n\r\n  And `failure` is not the recommend for rust community any more, see [`thiserror`] and [`anyhow`] for more details.\r\n\r\n[`thiserror`]: https://crates.io/crates/thiserror\r\n[`anyhow`]: https://crates.io/crates/anyhow\r\n\r\n- We don't have to handle error for the function `hex_string`, it could not be failed.\r\n\r\n### Tips for Review\r\n\r\n- [`#![no_std]` doesn't mean it will NOT use the `std` crate or it will compile this crate in `no-std` mode. It just prevents rust from loading the standard library automatically, **for current crate only**.](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/embedonomicon/smallest-no-std.html#what-does-no_std-mean)",
