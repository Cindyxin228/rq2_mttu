data was changed.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>See the differences.</summary>\r\n\r\n- In CKB v0.43.0, `Script` is:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/bbbe5a58f7024f1157fba75f26ab4e2fdfee1e38/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L75-L82\r\n\r\n- In CKB 0.100.0-rc1, `Script` is\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/c472ca3a924152c1a82adb0810ba5afa09548c79/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L80-L87\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Details about How it Happened\r\n\r\nIn the next hardfork, CKB 2021, a new version of CKB VM will be introduced, so we have to change the `hash_type` in `Script`.\r\n\r\n- In my first solution, the spec hash wasn't changed.\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>I just added an optional field <code>vm_version</code> and skipped serialization when its value was 0.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/e4dac8a043e9fd240c0afc90f594b6413e97bca0/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L20-L29\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n- Then, according to the review suggestions, I changed the `hash_type` from `String` to `Object`.\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>In this solution, the spec hash was changed since the serialized data was changed.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/40b449792f17acd23f910233f502991b6843da16/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L27-L35\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>So I introduced a new filed <code>edition</code> to keep the compatibility.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/40b449792f17acd23f910233f502991b6843da16/spec/src/lib.rs#L451-L460\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>Worse still, we had to face to an already known bug.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/40b449792f17acd23f910233f502991b6843da16/spec/src/lib.rs#L9-L11\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>I had no choice, except to change the order of fields.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/40b449792f17acd23f910233f502991b6843da16/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L157-L164\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n- Things are volatile. Almost the last days before we released the rc1, new opinion said the `hash_type` should be an enumeration type as the same as before.\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>Then I changed it back to an enumeration type.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/4aadeb90f552532cf93834f954e0c259b2a2ce6b/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L20-L27\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>After that, I reverted the design of `edition` according to the result of a new discussion, and used the new compatibility policy for configuration files to instead of it.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/8d1301d074e19a5dee8974d575e81d70adde414f/spec/src/lib.rs#L452-L461\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  The spec should be changed back to the original value since we decided to revert a compatible design.\r\n\r\n  But I didn't recall this incident.\r\n\r\n  So, the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\n### Affected Version\r\n\r\nOnly 0.100.0-rc1.",

construction functions which based on versions\r\n\r\n  Before this commit, constructing a core vm requires complicated arguments:\r\n\r\n  ```rust\r\n  #[cfg(has_asm)]\r\n  let v0_asm_machine = AsmCoreMachine::new(ISA_IMC, VERSION0, max_cycles);\r\n\r\n  #[cfg(not(has_asm))]\r\n  let v1_not_asm_machine = DefaultCoreMachine::<u64, WXorXMemory<SparseMemory<u64>>>::new(\r\n      ISA_IMC | ISA_B | ISA_MOP,\r\n      VERSION1,\r\n      u64::max_value(),\r\n  );\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  After this commit, no longer care about cargo features, CKB VM versions or IMC sets:\r\n\r\n  ```rust\r\n  let v0_asm_machine = ScriptVersion:V0.init_core_machine(max_cycles);\r\n\r\n  let v1_not_asm_machine = ScriptVersion::V1.init_core_machine_without_limit();\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- refactor(tests): simplify tx script verify construction functions\r\n\r\n  Before this commit, verifying requires complicated arguments:\r\n\r\n  ```rust\r\n  let fork_at = 10;\r\n  let store = new_store();\r\n  let data_loader = DataLoaderWrapper::new(&store);\r\n  let hardfork_switch = HardForkSwitch::new_without_any_enabled()\r\n      .as_builder()\r\n      .rfc_pr_0237(fork_at)\r\n      .rfc_pr_0234(fork_at)\r\n      .build()\r\n      .unwrap();\r\n  let consensus = ConsensusBuilder::default()\r\n      .hardfork_switch(hardfork_switch)\r\n      .build();\r\n  let tx_env0 = {\r\n      let epoch = EpochNumberWithFraction::new(0, 0, 1);\r\n      let header = HeaderView::new_advanced_builder()\r\n          .epoch(epoch.pack())\r\n          .build();\r\n      TxVerifyEnv::new_commit(&header)\r\n  };\r\n  let tx_env1 = {\r\n      let epoch = EpochNumberWithFraction::new(fork_at, 0, 1);\r\n      let header = HeaderView::new_advanced_builder()\r\n          .epoch(epoch.pack())\r\n          .build();\r\n      TxVerifyEnv::new_commit(&header)\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  let v0_result = TransactionScriptsVerifier::new(&rtx, &consensus, &data_loader, &tx_env0).verify(100_000_000);\r\n  let v1_result = TransactionScriptsVerifier::new(&rtx, &consensus, &data_loader, &tx_env1).verify(100_000_000);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  After this commit, no longer care about store, consensus or tx-env:\r\n\r\n  ```rust\r\n  let verifier = TransactionScriptsVerifierWithEnv::new();\r\n  let v0_result = verifier.verify_without_limit(ScriptVersion::V0, &rtx);\r\n  let v1_result = verifier.verify_without_limit(ScriptVersion::V1, &rtx);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  For customize verification rules, try the follow method:\r\n  ```rust\r\n  fn verify_map<R, F>(\r\n      &self,\r\n      version: ScriptVersion,\r\n      rtx: &ResolvedTransaction,\r\n      mut verify_func: F,\r\n  ) -> R\r\n  where\r\n      F: FnMut(TransactionScriptsVerifier<'_, DataLoaderWrapper<'_, ChainDB>>) -> R;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- test: add more unit tests\r\n\r\n  - test: test both vm version 0 and vm version 1 for all syscalls\r\n\r\n  - test: test both ckb 2019 and ckb 2021 for ckb script features\r\n\r\n  Before this PR, old features are only tested for version 0 and new features are only tested for version 1.", "reactions": {"url":

cause a few unintended consequences.\r\nFor example, the RPC return `\"0x\"` as the epoch of genesis block, but the integration tests checks if its length is `1`.\r\n\r\nAnd we couldn't convert it back with the same value.\r\n```rust\r\nlet original = Uint64::default();\r\nlet epoch: EpochNumberWithFraction = original.unpack();\r\nlet result: Uint64 = epoch.pack();\r\nassert_eq!(result,

`HeaderVerifier`:\r\n  - Check if the epoch is well formed.\r\n  - Check if the epoch is continuous.\r\n  So we can reject those blocks which have invalid epochs earlier.\r\n\r\n- If an `EpochNumberWithFraction`'s full value is `0`, returns `RationalU256::zero()` when calling `to_rational()`.\r\n  Because the full value of a genesis block' epoch is `0`.", "reactions": {"url":

building it twice, once with opt-level 0 and once with opt-level 3.\"\r\n\r\nSo, in this PR I customize the `opt-level` to the default values, to make sure each crates only be compiled once.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nWhen `make prod`  for `v0.42.0`:\r\n- This PR can reduce the number of compiled dependencies 9.56%  (`596 -> 544`).\r\n- This PR can reduce the size of target directory 14.2% (`1_813_100 bytes -> 1_587_780 bytes`).\r\n- Save total compile time.\r\n\r\n**Notice: the size of final binary won't be chaneged.**\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- [Cargo PR-8500: Build host

Comment `/execute basic-checks` will execute the `basic-checks` workflow.\r\n  - Comment `/execute unit-tests-checks` will execute the `unit-tests-checks` workflow.\r\n\r\n  [Slash Command Dispatch]: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slash-command-dispatch\r\n\r\nOther features:\r\n- Enable GitHub Actions that **require GitHub-hosted runners** for the forked repositories as default.\r\n- Allow disabling or enabling the GitHub-hosted CI tests for any branches in any repositories.\r\n  - If the HEAD commit message contains `enable github-hosted ci`, the GitHub-hosted CI tests will **be required**.\r\n  - If the HEAD commit message contains `disable github-hosted ci`, the GitHub-hosted CI tests will **be skipped**.\r\n\r\n### Default Workflows\r\n\r\nIn the follow flowchart, each node is a workflow and it has two cost time:\r\n- 1st is the time cost without cache;\r\n- 2nd is the time cost with cache.\r\n- So only 50 minutes real time (not total time) for each commit to run all checks.\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                                Preflight Checks ---------------> Check If Workflow is Required\r\n                                                    (39s, 32s)\r\n                                                        |                \r\n                                                        V                   |---> Rustfmt\r\n                                                No Compile Checks ----------+                          |-> Check Cargo.toml\r\n                                                  (3m20s, 2m54s)            |---> Check Coding Styles -+-> Check Whitespaces\r\n                                                        |                                              |-> Check Cyclic Dependencies\r\n       Clippy                <-|                        V\r\n       Compile               <-+            |-----------+-----------|\r\n(New!)

[CKB-RFCs PR 237: RFC: vm syscalls 2](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/237)\r\n\r\n  -  [CKB-RFCs PR 238: CKB VM version selection](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/238)\r\n\r\n- All changes are followed to the latest RFCs, except:\r\n\r\n  - Add a \"edition\" field to all configuration files: CKB chain specification or app configurations.\r\n\r\n#### CKB Chain Edition\r\n\r\n- If no `edition` field, the default edition is `\"2019\"`.\r\n\r\n-  After this PR, the default files created by `ckb init` will be edition `\"2021\"` files.\r\n\r\n   But the public chains will still use the edition `\"2019\"` CKB chain specification as the built-in spec.\r\n\r\n   At present, there are only to public chains: \"mainnet\" and \"testnet\".\r\n\r\n- The edition `\"2019\"` doesn't support hardfork parameters.\r\n\r\n- How to upgrade from edition `\"2019\"` to `\"2021\"`?\r\n\r\n  Modify your spec file (default is `specs/dev.toml`), `ckb.toml` and `ckb-miner.toml`:\r\n\r\n    - Update all `hash_type = \"data\"` to `hash_type.kind = \"data\"` and `hash_type.vm_version = 0`.\r\n\r\n    - Update all `hash_type = \"type\"` to `hash_type.kind = \"type\"`.\r\n\r\n    - Insert `edition = \"2021\"` into the head of the files.\r\n\r\n  After upgrade the edition of chain specification,  the first time to run the CKB, you have to use `--overwrite-spec` parameter. The details of this parameter can be found with `ckb run --help`.\r\n\r\n### BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n- The field `hash_type` in `Script` is changed from a `String` to an `Object` for all JSON RPC methods.\r\n\r\n  The details can be found in the latest RFCs.\r\n\r\n- The argument `--ba-hash-type` for `ckb init` is split into two arguments: `--ba-hash-type-kind` and `--ba-hash-type-vm-version`.\r\n\r\n  More details can be found with `ckb-release init --help`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/ckb/issues/2756/reactions",

<code>in_place_scope</code> and <code>in_place_scope_fifo</code> are variations of <code>scope</code>\nand <code>scope_fifo</code>, running the initial non-<code>Send</code> callback directly on the\ncurrent thread, rather than moving execution to the thread pool.</li>\n<li>With Rust 1.51 or later, arrays now implement <code>IntoParallelIterator</code>.</li>\n<li>New implementations of <code>FromParallelIterator</code> make it possible to <code>collect</code>\ncomplicated nestings of items.\n<ul>\n<li><code>FromParallelIterator&lt;(A, B)&gt; for (FromA, FromB)</code> works like <code>unzip</code>.</li>\n<li><code>FromParallelIterator&lt;Either&lt;L, R&gt;&gt; for (A, B)</code> works like <code>partition_map</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Type inference now works better with parallel <code>Range</code> and <code>RangeInclusive</code>.</li>\n<li>The implementation of <code>FromParallelIterator</code> and <code>ParallelExtend</code> for\n<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> now uses <code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code> internally to avoid creating any\nreferences to uninitialized data.</li>\n<li><code>ParallelBridge</code> fixed a bug with threads missing available work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n<p>Thanks to all of the contributors for this release!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/atouchet\"><code>@\u200batouchet</code></a></li>\n<li><a

hardfork Features\r\n\r\n**All following features can be found in RFC PRs.**\r\n\r\n- feat(hardfork): in the \"since epoch\", the index should be less than length\r\n\r\n  Ref: [CKB-RFCs PR 223: Ensure that index < length in input since field using epoch](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/223)\r\n\r\n- feat(hardfork): use block timestamp of input cells as relative since start timestamp\r\n\r\n  Ref: [CKB-RFCs PR 221: Use Block Timestamp as Start Timestamp in Since](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/221)\r\n\r\n- **[Reverted]** ~~feat(hardfork): allow unknown block versions and transactions versions~~\r\n\r\n  ~~Ref: [CKB-RFCs PR 230: Allow unknown tx & block version](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/230)~~\r\n\r\n- feat(hardfork): allow script multiple matches on identical data for type hash-type scripts\r\n\r\n  Ref: [CKB-RFCs PR 222: Allow script multiple matches on identical code](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/222)\r\n\r\n- feat(hardfork): reuse the uncles hash in the header as the extra hash\r\n\r\n  Ref: [CKB-RFCs PR 224: Add a variable length field in the block header](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/224)\r\n\r\n- **[Reverted]** ~~feat(hardfork): allow loading uncommitted cell data hashes from tx pool~~\r\n\r\n  ~~Ref: [CKB-RFCs PR 228: ckb2021: fix load_cell_data_hash syscall](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/228)~~\r\n\r\n#### Other Important Commits\r\n\r\n- feat(hardfork): setup the components for hard fork features\r\n\r\n- refactor: let verifiers know the real environment that the transaction is in\r\n\r\n  Almost all features require this refactor commit.\r\n\r\n- refactor: remove useless parameter \"with_data\" because it always be true (tricky)\r\n\r\n  So I can change less APIs and less code to apply the feature: allow loading uncommitted cell data hashes from tx pool.\r\n\r\n### About Tests\r\n\r\nAlmost all features have detailed integration tests (or unit tests):\r\n- Many blocks before hardfork;\r\n- Only one block before hardfork;\r\n- The block at hardfork;\r\n- Many blocks after hardfork.\r\n\r\nAll commits can passed all integration tests and unit tests.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nervosnetwork/ckb/issues/2715/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
