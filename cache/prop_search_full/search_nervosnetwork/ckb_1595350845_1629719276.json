well, so the chain works well.\r\n\r\nThe only things could be observed is that there are uncles in logs, but no real uncles in blocks.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and how it works?\r\n\r\nI checked all `Block::new_builder(..)`, and found 2 locations.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThis bug is not in  `version < 0.100`, so no release note is needed for the next release

`BlockBuilder`, all extra fields will be ignored, because the generated code of `BlockBuilder` couldn't know any about extra fields.\r\n\r\nAnd the extension field is an extra field on the molecule-serialized `struct Block`, it will be ignored, too.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nWe already have the advanced `Block` builder, which is not generated.\r\n\r\nThe `as_advanced_builder` will handle the extension field.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce the issue and test the solution?\r\n\r\n- Set the `extension` in the [`TxPoolService::build_block_template(..)`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/fb27f98b699768f6723b11b904abeacf8fae093a/tx-pool/src/process.rs#L305) to the follow value:\r\n    ```rust\r\n    let extension = if candidate_number % 2 == 0 {\r\n        let bytes: Bytes = format!(\"block number = {}\", candidate_number).as_bytes().pack();\r\n        Some(bytes.into())\r\n    } else {\r\n        None\r\n    };\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Start a dev chain with [`func = \"Eaglesong\"`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/fb27f98b699768f6723b11b904abeacf8fae093a/resource/specs/dev.toml#L107) and

v0.43.0. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- **(BREAK CHANGES)** Due to the refactor of [`metrics-rs`] `>0.12.1`, we couldn't keep the same configurations as before.\r\n\r\n  Since the metrics feature  is an experimental and development-only feature, I just made some break changes.\r\n\r\n- According to the suggestion from @doitian, replaces [`metrics-rs`] with [`opentelemetry-rust`].\r\n\r\n  As [`opentelemetry-rust`] said, [it is not stable, too](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry/0.15.0/opentelemetry/#metrics), so I didn't change the APIs. I just wrote a series of compatible macros.\r\n\r\n  Due to the difference of those two crates, the presentation of data couldn't be totally the same as before.\r\n\r\n  We could tweak them later according to actual requirements.\r\n\r\n### In the Further\r\n\r\nI just let it works again, it only supports export data over a Prometheus endpoint with a preset settings, now.\r\n\r\nAny more changes should be added later,  according to actual requirements.\r\n\r\n[`opentelemetry-rust`]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust\r\n[`metrics-rs`]:

v1.0.\r\n\r\n#### To Be Continued\r\n\r\nThis PR still left one dependency which is depended on tokio v0.2, because that upgrade will change a lot of code, I prefer to put that in another PR later.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Bump jsonrpc-* from 0.17.1 to 0.18.0.\r\n\r\n- Bump reqwest from 0.10.9 to 0.11.4.\r\n\r\n- Bump hyper from 0.13 to 0.14.\r\n\r\n- Bump hyper-tls from 0.4 to 0.5.\r\n\r\n- Bump trust-dns-resolver from 0.19 to 0.20.\r\n\r\n- Bump ckb-sentry 0.21.0 to sentry 0.23.0.\r\n\r\n  - We forked sentry to fix [RUSTSEC-2020-0041](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0041.html), now that issue was fixed in upstream.\r\n\r\n- Use `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel(1)` instead of `tokio::sync::oneshot::channel()` in `tx_pool`.\r\n\r\n  - To fix error \"Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime.\" after upgrading RPC server's tokio.\r\n\r\n    - JSON RPC server doesn't allow to use customize tokio executor.\r\n\r\n      Ref: [`pub fn event_loop_executor(self, executor: tokio::Handle) -> Self;`](https://docs.rs/jsonrpc-http-server/18.0.0/jsonrpc_http_server/struct.ServerBuilder.html#method.event_loop_executor)\r\n\r\n  - Use `block_in_place(|| response.recv())` instead of `self.handle.block_on(response)`.\r\n\r\n    Without `block_in_place`, RPC service will be blocked very frequently.", "reactions": {"url":

It cannot be considered that this node is always at the highest just because it is synchronized to the highest one time. That is to say, the completed state of sync should be dynamically converted to need sync again. \r\n\r\nThe `TipSynced` status indicates that this node has synchronized the headers and will try to synchronize again after 28s. At the same time, such a node can be used as the request object of `Getblocks`\r\n\r\n`Suspend` and `TipSynced` are not exactly the same. Suspend thinks that the node may have some problems, such as being in the ibd state and suspending the sync request to it. Such a node cannot be used as the request object of the sync block, and it does not need to be based on the frequency of the block time to detection status ", "reactions": {"url":

next hardfork, CKB 2021, a new version of CKB VM will be introduced, so we have to change the `hash_type` in `Script`.\r\n\r\n- In my first solution, the spec hash wasn't changed.\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>I just added an optional field <code>vm_version</code> and skipped serialization when its value was 0.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/e4dac8a043e9fd240c0afc90f594b6413e97bca0/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L20-L29\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n- Then, according to the review suggestions, I changed the `hash_type` from `String` to `Object`.\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>In this solution, the spec hash was changed since the serialized data was changed.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/40b449792f17acd23f910233f502991b6843da16/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L27-L35\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>So I introduced a new

</details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>Worse still, we had to face to an already known bug.</summary>\r\n\r\n

fields.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/40b449792f17acd23f910233f502991b6843da16/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L157-L164\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n- Things are volatile. Almost the last days before we released the rc1, new opinion said the `hash_type` should be an enumeration type as the same as before.\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>Then I changed it back to an enumeration type.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/4aadeb90f552532cf93834f954e0c259b2a2ce6b/util/jsonrpc-types/src/blockchain.rs#L20-L27\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  <details><summary>After that, I reverted the design of `edition` according to the result of a new discussion, and used the new compatibility policy for configuration files to instead of it.</summary>\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/8d1301d074e19a5dee8974d575e81d70adde414f/spec/src/lib.rs#L452-L461\r\n\r\n  </details>\r\n\r\n  The spec should be changed back to the original value since we decided to revert a compatible design.\r\n\r\n  But I didn't recall this incident.\r\n\r\n  So, the bug was introduced.\r\n\r\n### Affected Version\r\n\r\nOnly 0.100.0-rc1.",
