"merged_at": "2023-02-01T12:37:14Z"}, "body": "## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n### Update to Federation v2.3.0 ([Issue #2465](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2465), [Issue #2485](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2485) and [Issue #2489](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489))\n\nThis brings in Federation v2.3.0 execution support for:\n- `@interfaceObject` (added to federation in [federation#2277](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/2277)).\n- the bug fix from [federation#2294](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2294).\n\nBy [@abernix](https://github.com/abernix) and [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2462\nBy [@pcmanus](https://github.com/pcmanus) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2485 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489\n\n### Always deduplicate variables ([Issue #2387](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2387))\n\nVariable deduplication allows the router to reduce the number of entities that are requested from subgraphs if some of them are redundant, and as such reduce the size of subgraph responses. It has been available for a while but was not active by default. This is now always on.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2445\n\n### Add optional `Access-Control-Max-Age` header to CORS plugin ([Issue #2212](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2212))\n\nAdds new option called `max_age` to the existing `cors` object which will set the value returned in the [`Access-Control-Max-Age`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Max-Age) header. As was the case previously, when this value is not set **no** value is returned.\n\nIt can be enabled using our standard time notation, as follows:\n\n```\ncors:\n  max_age: 1day\n```\n\nBy [@osamra-rbi](https://github.com/osamra-rbi) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2331\n\n### Improved support for wildcards in `supergraph.path` configuration ([Issue #2406](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2406))\n\nYou can now use a wildcard in supergraph endpoint `path` like this:\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  listen: 0.0.0.0:4000\n  path: /graph*\n```\n\nIn this example, the Router would respond to requests on both `/graphql` and `/graphiql`.\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2410\n\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Fixes\n\n### Forbid caching `PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND` responses ([Issue #2502](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2502))\n\nThe router now sends a `cache-control: private, no-cache, must-revalidate` response header to clients, in addition to the existing `PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND` error code on the response which was being sent previously.  This expanded behaviour occurs when when a persisted query hash could not be found and is important since such responses should **not** be cached by intermediary proxies/CDNs since the client will need to be able to send the full query directly to the Router on a subsequent request.\n\nBy [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2503\n### Listen on root URL when `/*` is set in `supergraph.path` configuration ([Issue #2471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2471))\n\nThis resolves a regression which occurred in Router 1.8 when using wildcard notation on a path-boundary, as such:\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  path: /*\n```\n\nThis occurred due to an underlying [Axum upgrade](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/releases/tag/axum-v0.6.0) and resulted in failure to listen on `localhost` when a path was absent. We now special case `/*` to also listen to the URL without a path so you're able to call `http://localhost` (for example).\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2472\n\n### Return a proper timeout response ([Issue #2360](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2360) [Issue #2400](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/240))\n\nThere was a regression where timeouts resulted in a HTTP response of `500 Internal Server Error`. This is now fixed with a test to guarantee it, the status code is now `504 Gateway Timeout` (instead of the previous `408 Request Timeout` which, was also incorrect in that it blamed the client).\n\nThere is also a new metric emitted called `apollo_router_timeout` to track when timeouts are triggered.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2419\n\n### Fix panic in schema parse error reporting ([Issue #2269](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2269))\n\nIn order to support introspection, some definitions like `type __Field { \u2026 }` are implicitly added to schemas. This addition was done by string concatenation at the source level. In some cases like unclosed braces, a parse error could be reported at a position beyond the size of the original source. This would cause a panic because only the unconcatenated string is sent to the error reporting library `miette`.\n\nInstead, the Router now parses introspection types separately and \"concatenates\" the definitions at the AST level.\n\nBy [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2448\n\n### Always accept compressed subgraph responses  ([Issue #2415](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2415))\n\nPreviously, subgraph response decompression was only supported when subgraph request compression was _explicitly_ configured. This is now always active.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2450\n\n### Fix handling of root query operations not named `Query`\n\nIf you'd mapped your default `Query` type to something other than the default using `schema { query: OtherQuery }`, some parsing code in the Router would incorrectly return an error because it had previously assumed the default name of `Query`. The same case would have occurred if the root mutation type was not named `Mutation`.\n\nThis is now corrected and the Router understands the mapping.\n\nBy [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2459\n\n### Remove the `locations` field from subgraph errors ([Issue #2297](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2297))\n\nSubgraph errors can come with a `locations` field indicating which part of the query was causing issues, but it refers to the subgraph query generated by the query planner, and we have no way of translating it to locations in the client query. To avoid confusion, we've removed this field from the response until we can provide a more coherent way to map these errors back to the original operation.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2442\n\n### Emit metrics showing number of client connections ([issue #2384](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2384))\n\nNew metrics are available to track the client connections:\n\n- `apollo_router_session_count_total` indicates the number of currently connected clients\n- `apollo_router_session_count_active` indicates the number of in flight GraphQL requests from connected clients.\n\nThis also fixes the behaviour when we reach the maximum number of file descriptors: instead of going into a busy loop, the router will wait a bit before accepting a new connection.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2395\n\n### `--dev` will no longer modify configuration that it does not directly touch ([Issue #2404](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2404), [Issue #2481](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2481))\n\nPreviously, the Router's `--dev` mode was operating against the configuration object model. This meant that it would sometimes replace pieces of configuration where it should have merely modified it.  Now, `--dev` mode will _override_ the following properties in the YAML config, but it will leave any adjacent configuration as it was:\n\n```yaml\nhomepage:\n  enabled: false\ninclude_subgraph_errors:\n  all: true\nplugins:\n  experimental.expose_query_plan: true\nsandbox:\n  enabled: true\nsupergraph:\n  introspection: true\ntelemetry:\n  tracing:\n    experimental_response_trace_id:\n      enabled: true\n```\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Maintenance\n\n### Improve #[serde(default)] attribute on structs ([Issue #2424](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2424))\n\nIf all the fields of your `struct` have their default value then use the `#[serde(default)]` on the `struct` instead of on each field. If you have specific default values for a field, you'll have to create your own `impl Default` for the `struct`.\n\n#### Correct approach\n\n```rust\n#[serde(deny_unknown_fields, default)]\nstruct Export {\n    url: Url,\n    enabled: bool\n}\n\nimpl Default for Export {\n  fn default() -> Self {\n    Self {\n      url: default_url_fn(),\n      enabled: false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Discouraged approach\n\n```rust\n#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]\nstruct Export {\n    #[serde(default=\"default_url_fn\")\n    url: Url,\n    #[serde(default)]\n    enabled: bool\n}\n```\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2424\n\n## \ud83d\udcc3 Configuration\n\nConfiguration changes will be [automatically migrated on load](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview#upgrading-your-router-configuration). However, you should update your source configuration files as these will become breaking changes in a future major release.\n\n### `health-check` has been renamed to `health_check` ([Issue #2161](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2161))\n\nThe `health_check` option in the configuration has been renamed to use `snake_case` rather than `kebab-case` for consistency with the other properties in the configuration:\n\n```diff\n-health-check:\n+health_check:\n   enabled: true\n```\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2451 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2463\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\n### Disabling anonymous usage metrics ([Issue #2478](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2478))\n\nTo disable the anonymous usage metrics, you set `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in the environment.  The documentation previously said to use `1` as the value instead of `true`.  In the future, either will work, so this is primarily a bandaid for the immediate error.\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2479\n\n### `send_headers` and `send_variable_values` in `telemetry.apollo` ([Issue #2149](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2149))\n\n+ `send_headers`\n\n  Provide this field to configure which request header names and values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are: `only` with an array, `except` with an array, `none`, `all`.\n\n  The default value is `none``, which means no header names or values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from potentially reaching the Router.\n\n+ `send_variable_values`\n\n  Provide this field to configure which variable values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are: `only` with an array, `except` with an array, `none`, `all`.\n\n  The default value is `none`, which means no variable values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from potentially reaching the Router.\n\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2435\n\n### Propagating headers between subgraphs ([Issue #2128](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2128))\n\nPassing headers between subgraph services is possible via Rhai script and we've added an example to the [header propagation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/header-propagation) documentation.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2446\n\n### Propagating response headers to clients ([Issue #1284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1284))\n\nPassing headers from subgraph services to clients is possible via Rhai script and we've added an example to the [header propagation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/header-propagation) documentation.\n\nBy [@lennyburdette](https://github.com/lennyburdette) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2474\n\n### IPv6 listening instructions ([Issue #1835](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1835))\n\nAdded instructions for how to represent IPv6 listening addresses to our [Overview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview) documentation.\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  # The socket address and port to listen on.\n  # Note that this must be quoted to avoid interpretation as a yaml array.\n  listen: '[::1]:4000'\n```\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2440\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Maintenance\n\n### Parse schemas and queries with `apollo-compiler`\n\nThe Router now uses the higher-level representation (HIR) from `apollo-compiler` instead of using the AST from `apollo-parser` directly.  This is a first step towards replacing a bunch of code that grew organically during the Router's early days, with a general-purpose library with intentional design.  Internal data structures are unchanged for now.  Parsing behavior has been tested to be identical on a large corpus of schemas and queries.\n\nBy [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2466\n\n### Disregard value of `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` in Orbiter unit tests ([Issue #2487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2487))\n\nThe `orbiter::test::test_visit_args` tests were failing in the event that `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` was set, however this is now corrected.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2488\n\n## \ud83e\udd7c Experimental\n\n### JWT authentication ([Issue #912](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/912))\n\nAs a result of UX feedback, we are modifying the experimental JWT configuration. The `jwks_url` parameter is renamed to `jwks_urls` and now expects to receive an array of URLs, rather than a single URL.\n\nWe've updated the [JWT Authentication documentation](apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authn-jwt) accordingly, however here's a short sample configuration example:\n\n```yaml\nauthentication:\n  experimental:\n    jwt:\n      jwks_urls:\n        - https://dev-abcd1234.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json\n```\n\nBy [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2500\n", "reactions":

The \"alg\" question will potentially be resolved by a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n- Fix #912\r\n\r\nThis modifies the experimental JWT authentication support so that multiple JWKS urls are now supported.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is draft; pending a review and feedback with product.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding multiple JWKS we need to resolve the following issue:\r\n\r\n### Not all JWKS entries contain \"alg\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the router can't find \"alg\" in the JWKS. Then it will fail the request. The JWKS spec notes that \"alg\" is optional, but if we don't know what the \"alg\" is, then we can't decode the JWT.\r\n\r\nHere are some alternatives:\r\n-  Preserve the existing behaviour (i.e. fail if \"alg\" isn't specified)\r\n-  Look for \"alg\" in the JWT header and use that value if not found in JWKSs\r\n-  Allow \"alg\" (per IDP) to be specified in configuration either as\r\n    -  A fallback or\r\n    -  An override\r\n\r\nWhich of the above would users prefer?\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\nComplete the checklist (and note appropriate exceptions) before a final PR is raised.\r\n\r\n~- [ ] Changes are compatible[^1]~\r\n- [x] Documentation[^2] completed\r\n- [x] Performance impact assessed and acceptable\r\n- Tests added and passing[^3]\r\n    - [x] Unit Tests\r\n    ~- [ ] Integration Tests~\r\n    ~- [ ] Manual Tests~\r\n\r\n**Exceptions**\r\n\r\nThe change is to experimental configuration and not compatible.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n[^1].

[#&#8203;7314](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/7314) [`f246ddb71`](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/f246ddb7142d978a927de743108b602c511be119) Thanks [@&#8203;trevor-scheer](https://togithub.com/trevor-scheer)! - Add an `__identity` property to `HeaderMap` class to disallow standard `Map`s (in TypeScript).\n\n    This ensures that typechecking occurs on fields which are declared to accept a\n    `HeaderMap` (notably, the `httpGraphQLRequest.headers` option to\n    `ApolloServer.executeHTTPGraphQLRequest` and the `http.headers` option to\n    `ApolloServer.executeOperation`). This might be a breaking change for\n    integration authors, but should be easily fixed by switching from `new\n    Map<string, string>()` to `new HeaderMap()`.\n\n-   [#&#8203;7326](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/pull/7326) [`e25cb58ff`](https://togithub.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/e25cb58fffe54301fec562a72f845394c8ff4408) Thanks [@&#8203;trevor-scheer](https://togithub.com/trevor-scheer)! - Pin `node-abort-controller` version to avoid breaking change.

`router-bridge@0.1.13-beta.0+v2.3.0-beta.3`.\r\n\r\nHowever, an underlying dependency, `deno_core`, has pinned a lot of dependencies in their latest release to versions which predate the versions which we now have in `apollo-router`, which we have updated to via `cargo update` and various Renovate-automated upgrades.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to make `0.1.13-beta.0+v2.3.0-beta.3` work, , we need to revert some of those dependency updates to allow the version dependencies to be resolved.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2462/reactions",

[GHSA-m4ch-rfv5-x5g3](https://togithub.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq)\n\nThe git2 and libgit2-sys crates are Rust wrappers around the [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) C library. It was discovered that libgit2 1.5.0 and below did not verify SSH host keys when establishing an SSH connection, exposing users of the library to Man-In-the-Middle attacks.\n\nThe libgit2 team assigned [CVE-2023-22742](https://togithub.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq) to this vulnerability. The following versions of the libgit2-sys Rust crate have been released:\n\n* libgit2-sys 0.14.2, updating the underlying libgit2 C library to version 1.5.1.\n* libgit2-sys 0.13.5, updating the underlying libgit2 C library to version 1.4.5.\n\nA new git2 crate version has also been released, 0.16.1. This version only bumps its libgit2-sys dependency to ensure no vulnerable libgit2-sys versions are used, but contains no code changes: if you update the libgit2-sys version there is no need to also update the git2 crate version.\n\n[You can learn more about this vulnerability in libgit2's advisory](https://togithub.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq)\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>rust-lang/git2-rs</summary>\n\n### [`v0.16.1`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/compare/0.16.0...0.16.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/compare/0.16.0...0.16.1)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

It has one commit in it which was not generated by the release script.  That commit fixes the release script.  The changelog is copied into this PR body for formatting preview purposes.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\n\n### Add support for `base64::encode()` / `base64::decode()` in Rhai ([Issue #2025](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2025))\n\nTwo new functions, `base64::encode()` and `base64::decode()`, have been added to the capabilities available within Rhai scripts to Base64-encode or Base64-decode strings, respectively.\n\nBy [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394\n\n### Override the root TLS certificate list for subgraph requests ([Issue #1503](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1503))\n\nIn some cases, users need to use self-signed certificates or use a custom certificate authority (CA) when communicating with subgraphs.\n\nIt is now possible to consigure these certificate-related details using configuration for either specific subgraphs or all subgraphs, as follows:\n\n```yaml\ntls:\n  subgraph:\n    all:\n      certificate_authorities: \"\"\n    # Use a separate certificate for the `products` subgraph.\n    subgraphs:\n      products:\n        certificate_authorities: \"\"\n```\n\nThe file referenced in the `certificate_authorities` value is expected to be the combination of several PEM certificates, concatenated together into a single file (as is commonplace with Apache TLS configuration).\n\nThese certificates are only configurable via the Router's configuration since using `SSL_CERT_FILE` would also override certificates for sending telemetry and communicating with Apollo Uplink.\n\nWhile we do not currently support terminating TLS at the Router (from clients), the `tls` is located at the root of the configuration file to allow all TLS-related configuration to be semantically grouped together in the future.\n\nNote: If you are attempting to use a self-signed certificate, it must be generated with the proper file extension and with `basicConstraints` disabled.  For example, a `v3.ext` extension file:\n\n```\nsubjectKeyIdentifier   = hash\nauthorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always\n# this has to be disabled\n# basicConstraints       = CA:TRUE\nkeyUsage               = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign\nsubjectAltName         = DNS:local.apollo.dev\nissuerAltName          = issuer:copy\n```\n\nUsing this `v3.ext` file, the certificate can be generated with the appropriate certificate signing request (CSR) - in this example, `server.csr` - using the following `openssl` command:\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -extfile v3.ext\n```\n\nThis will produce the file as `server.crt` which can be passed as `certificate_authorities`.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2008\n\n### Measure the Router's processing time ([Issue #1949](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1949) [Issue #2057](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2057))\n\nThe Router now emits a metric called `apollo_router_processing_time` which measures the time spent executing the request **minus** the time spent waiting for an external requests (e.g., subgraph request/response or external plugin request/response).  This measurement accounts both for the time spent actually executing the request sa well as the time spent waiting for concurrent client requests to be executed.  The unit of measurement for the metric is in seconds, though this is not meant to indicate in any way that the Router is going to add actual seconds of overhead.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2371\n\n### Automated persisted queries support for subgraph requests ([PR #2284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2284))\n\nAutomatic persisted queries (APQ) (See useful context [in our Apollo Server docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)) can now be used for subgraph requests. It is disabled by default, and can be configured for all subgraphs or per subgraph:\n\n```yaml title=\"router.yaml\"\nsupergraph:\n  apq:\n    subgraph:\n      # override for all subgraphs\n      all:\n        enabled: false\n      # override per subgraph\n      subgraphs:\n        products:\n          enabled: true\n```\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2284 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2418\n\n### Allow the disabling of automated persisted queries ([PR #2386](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2386))\n\nAutomatic persisted queries (APQ) support is still enabled by default, but can now be disabled using configuration:\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  apq:\n    enabled: false\n```\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2386\n\n### Anonymous product usage analytics ([Issue #2124](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2124), [Issue #2397](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2397), [Issue #2412](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2412))\n\nFollowing up on https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1630, the Router transmits anonymous usage telemetry about configurable feature usage which helps guide Router product development.  No information is transmitted in our usage collection that includes any request-specific information.  Knowing what features and configuration our users are depending on allows us to evaluate opportunities to reduce complexity and remain diligent about the surface area of the Router over time.  The privacy of your and your user's data is of critical importance to the core Router team and we handle it with great care in accordance with our [privacy policy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/privacy/), which clearly states which data we collect and transmit and offers information on how to opt-out.\n\nBooleans and numeric values are included, however, any strings are represented as `<redacted>` to avoid leaking confidential or sensitive information.\n\nFor example:\n```json\n{\n   \"session_id\": \"fbe09da3-ebdb-4863-8086-feb97464b8d7\", // Randomly generated at Router startup.\n   \"version\": \"1.4.0\", // The version of the router\n   \"os\": \"linux\",\n   \"ci\": null, // If CI is detected then this will name the CI vendor\n   \"usage\": {\n     \"configuration.headers.all.request.propagate.named.<redacted>\": 3,\n     \"configuration.headers.all.request.propagate.default.<redacted>\": 1,\n     \"configuration.headers.all.request.len\": 3,\n     \"configuration.headers.subgraphs.<redacted>.request.propagate.named.<redacted>\": 2,\n     \"configuration.headers.subgraphs.<redacted>.request.len\": 2,\n     \"configuration.headers.subgraphs.len\": 1,\n     \"configuration.homepage.enabled.true\": 1,\n     \"args.config-path.redacted\": 1,\n     \"args.hot-reload.true\": 1,\n     //Many more keys. This is dynamic and will change over time.\n     //More...\n     //More...\n     //More...\n   }\n }\n```\n\nUsers can disable this mechanism by setting the environment variable `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in their environment.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2173, https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2398, https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2413\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Fixes\n\n### Don't send header names to Studio if `send_headers` is `none` ([Issue #2403](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2403))\n\nWe no longer transmit header **names** to Apollo Studio when `send_headers` is set to `none` (the default).  Previously, when `send_headers` was set to `none` (like in the following example) the header names were still transmitted with _empty_ header values.   No actual values were ever being sent unless `send_headers` was sent to a more permissive option like `forward_headers_only` or `forward_headers_except`.\n\n```yaml\ntelemetry:\n  apollo:\n    send_headers: none\n```\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2425\n\n\n### Response with `Content-type: application/json` when encountering incompatible `Content-type` or `Accept` request headers ([Issue #2334](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2334))\n\nWhen receiving requests with `content-type` and `accept` header mismatches (e.g., on multipart requests) the Router now utilizes a correct `content-type` header in its response.\n\nBy [@Meemaw](https://github.com/Meemaw) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2370\n\n### Fix `APOLLO_USAGE_REPORTING_INGRESS_URL` behavior when Router was run without a configuration file\n\nThe environment variable `APOLLO_USAGE_REPORTING_INGRESS_URL` (not usually necessary under typical operation) was **not** being applied correctly when the Router was run without a configuration file.\nIn addition, defaulting of environment variables now directly injects the variable rather than injecting via expansion expression.  This means that the use of `APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_ENV_PREFIX` (even less common) doesn't affect injected configuration defaults.\n\nBy [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2432\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Maintenance\n\n### Remove unused factory traits ([Issue #2180](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2372))\n\nWe removed a factory trait that was only used in a single implementation, which removes the overall requirement that execution and subgraph building take place via that factory trait.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2372\n\n### Optimize header propagation plugin's regular expression matching ([PR #2392](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2392))\n\nWe've changed the header propagation plugins' behavior to reduce the chance of memory allocations occurring when applying regex-based header\u00a0propagation rules.\n\nBy [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2392\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\n### Creating custom metrics in plugins ([Issue #2294](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2294))\n\nTo create your custom metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) you can use the [`tracing` macros](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html#macros) to generate an event. If you observe a specific naming pattern for your event, you'll be able to generate your own custom metrics directly in Prometheus.\n\nTo publish a new metric, use tracing macros to generate an event that contains one of the following prefixes:\n\n`monotonic_counter.` _(non-negative numbers)_: Used when the metric will only ever increase.\n`counter.`: For when the metric may increase or decrease over time.\n`value.`: For discrete data points (i.e., when taking the sum of values does not make semantic sense)\n`histogram.`: For building histograms (takes `f64`)\n\nThis information is also available in [the Apollo Router documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/native#add-custom-metrics).\n\nBy [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2417\n\n## \ud83e\udd7c Experimental\n\n### JWT authentication ([Issue #912](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/912))\n\nExperimental JWT authentication is now configurable.  Here's a typical sample configuration fragment:\n\n```yaml\nauthentication:\n  experimental:\n    jwt:\n      jwks_url: https://dev-zzp5enui.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json\n```\n\nUntil the documentation is published, you can [read more about configuring it](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/dev/docs/source/configuration/authn-jwt.mdx) in our GitHub repository source.\n\nBy [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2348\n\n### Redis cache for APQ and query planning ([PR #2431](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2431))\n\nExperimental caching was [already available for APQ and query planning](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md#experimental--apq-and-query-planner-redis-caching-fixes-pr-2176) but required a custom router build with the `experimental_cache` Cargo feature. That feature is now removed to make that cache easier to test.\n\nBy [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2431\n\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2456/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2456/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2454", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2454/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2454/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2454/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2454", "id": 1551224643, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGU7c0s5IO6kf", "number": 2454, "title": "Fix spelling mistakes in documentation", "user": {"login": "dsul", "id": 16121610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTIxNjEw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16121610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul", "html_url": "https://github.com/dsul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dsul/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-01-20T17:36:41Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-29T23:12:40Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-23T09:13:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/pulls/2454", "html_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2454", "diff_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2454.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2454.patch", "merged_at": "2023-01-23T09:13:13Z"}, "body": "Hi.

Previously Configuration::default() was using the builder rather than the parse logic.\r\n\r\nIn addition the defaulting mechanism now works directly against config with the env variables, so prefixing no longer interferes.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\nComplete the checklist (and note appropriate exceptions) before a final PR is raised.\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes are compatible[^1]\r\n- [ ] ~~Documentation[^2] completed~~\r\n- [ ] ~~Performance impact assessed and acceptable~~\r\n- Tests added and passing[^3]\r\n    - [x] Unit Tests\r\n    - [ ] ~~Integration Tests~~\r\n    - [x] Manual Tests\r\n\r\n**Exceptions**\r\n\r\nNo docs needed as this is not a change or new  in functionality.\r\n\r\n*Note any exceptions here*\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nIn future we should consider removing the `Configuration::builder()`. We can leave the fake one. Goal would be that we have a single way of creating Configuration rather than the multiple that we have right now.\r\n\r\n[^1]. It may be appropriate to bring upcoming changes to the attention of other (impacted) groups. Please endeavour to do this before seeking PR approval. The mechanism for doing this will vary considerably, so use your judgement as to how and when to do this.\r\n[^2]. Configuration is an important part of many changes. Where applicable please try to document configuration examples.\r\n[^3]. Tick whichever testing boxes are applicable. If you are adding Manual Tests:\r\n    - please document the manual testing (extensively) in the Exceptions.\r\n    - please raise a separate issue to automate the test and label it (or ask for it to be labeled) as `manual test`\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2432/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

full release before they can be tested by interested/affected parties.\r\n\r\nThanks to work done in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2202 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2323, we now have just enough automation in our release pipeline to take care of some of the necessary work for building these releases.\r\n\r\nWith some follow-up work, we can have these triggered through:\r\n\r\n- [Manual triggers] through CircleCI\r\n- [Scheduled pipeline] runs in CircleCI\r\n\r\n[Scheduled pipeline]: https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines/\r\n[Manual triggers]: https://circleci.com/docs/triggers-overview/#run-a-pipeline-from-the-circleci-web-app\r\n\r\nThis work touches on ideas from https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/229 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/242, though neither of those issues are _directly_ \"build nightly releases\", though I did suggest it in my comments on one of them.\r\n\r\nOverall, this creates Router versions of the format `v0.0.0-nightly+YYYYMMDD.COMMIT_HASH`, which look roughly like `router-v0.0.0-nightly+20220102.abcd1234-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` as binaries which we can attach to non-latest releases on GitHub Releases.\r\n\r\n### Overall Plan / Follow-ups\r\n\r\nI haven't executed this full plan yet, but the near-term follow-ups to this are:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make these nightly releases available as [pre-releases on GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)\r\n- [ ] Publish the Docker containers to [our GitHub Container Registry repo](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router)\r\n- [ ] Publish nightly builds as Cargo crates to [our apollo-router crate](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-router)\r\n\r\nThese are still up for discussions.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nComplete the checklist (and note appropriate exceptions) before a final PR is raised.\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes are compatible[^1]\r\n- [x] Documentation[^2] completed\r\n        The documentation is definitely not finished, but that's covered in https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2261\r\n- [x] Performance impact assessed and acceptable\r\n- Tests added and passing[^3]\r\n    - ~Unit Tests~\r\n    - ~Integration Tests~\r\n    - [x] Manual Tests\r\n\r\n**Exceptions**\r\nAs with most CI-based workflows, testing can be a bit challenging.  Overall, this can be tested locally by emulating the steps in the CircleCI file:\r\n\r\n1. Being in a clean Git tree state with the PR checked out.\r\n2. Running `cargo xtask release prepare nightly`\r\n3. `mkdir -p artifacts`\r\n4. `cargo xtask package --output artifacts/`\r\n\r\nThis will need to be documented as part of https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2261\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n[^1].

At this point, trying to accept a new connection results in an error, and the router tries in a loop to accept connections.\r\nWhat makes the behaviour worse:\r\n- calling the `accept()` syscall makes the current thread block\r\n- since we're not accepting connections, the accept queue stays full so the syscall will never return the \"would block\" error\r\n- if the router only has one core available, this leaves no time for the rest of the router to work so it completely hangs (CTRL+C does not even work)\r\n\r\nThis PR will fix the behaviour of the router when reaching this limit:\r\n- [x] reduce the number of log messages that will appear\r\n- [x] add a metric tracking the number of client sessions\r\n- [ ] back off on accepting new connections until we have more file descriptors available\r\n\r\nThat last point will require some thought. Right now there's a small delay (1ms) to let the router perform other work, but it will go in a loop of accepting new connections, sleeping because it reaches the max, then accepting again, so some kind of hysteresis mechanism should be used to get some breathing room.\r\n\r\nManually limiting the maximum number of client sessions (#2385) would give us more flexibility:\r\n- we can set it lower than the max open file limit, to leave enough file descriptors for backend connections\r\n- we can check at startup that it is indeed lower than max open file (and prevent it from booting if not)\r\n- we can use a design similar to [BandAid](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/meet-bandaid-the-dropbox-service-proxy):\r\n  - accept connections as soon as possible, put them in a LIFO queue with a configurable timeout. Older connections get closed\r\n  - if we reach the maximum number of connections, we know we cannot handle the new traffic, so we aggressively close new connections as soon as they are accepted. This signals early to the client that they should retry with another server\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2395/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2395/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2394", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2394/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2394/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2394/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394", "id": 1530637905, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGU7c0s5HPfxI", "number": 2394, "title": "add support for base64 decode/encode to rhai", "user": {"login": "garypen", "id": 107218, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIxOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107218?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen", "html_url": "https://github.com/garypen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "garypen", "id": 107218, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIxOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107218?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen", "html_url": "https://github.com/garypen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "garypen", "id": 107218, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIxOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107218?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen", "html_url": "https://github.com/garypen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garypen/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-01-12T12:34:20Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-18T09:57:55Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-18T09:57:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/pulls/2394", "html_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394", "diff_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394.patch", "merged_at": "2023-01-18T09:57:54Z"}, "body": " -

This PR adds a new option called max_age that is used like so:\r\n```\r\ncors:\r\n  max_age: 86400\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not solve the Cache-Control header mentioned in issue as it's a bit separate from CORS.\r\n\r\nNew test(s) and documentation changes haven't been done yet as I wanted to confirm this is fine before proceeding further. If so, happy to do them. Thanks!\r\n\r\n(FYI I don't have the ability to assign a reviewer or anything, if we're able to do that)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2331/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apollographql/router/issues/2331/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
