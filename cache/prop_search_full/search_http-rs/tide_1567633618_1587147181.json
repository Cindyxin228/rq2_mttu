Current design is as follows:\r\n\r\n* `Route::middleware` applies given middleware to the route.\r\n* Following `Route::method` (and `Route::all`) will apply middleware given before.\r\n* Middleware list for the route can be reset using `Route::reset_middleware`.\r\n* When `Route::at` is called, per-route middleware applied to the parent will be applied to the child route by default. This can be reset using `.reset_middleware()`.\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment if there is better design!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCloses #320.", "reactions": {"url":

{\r\n   author: Option<String>,\r\n   theme: Option<String>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn master, this requires using `unwrap_or` on the outcome of `.query` which I think it's unnecessary.\r\nIf you forget about it, it leads to surprising behavior: calling the endpoint with any query parameter (none of which in the struct) would trigger a successful deserialisation, while a call without query params would result in a 400. \r\n\r\nI have also added, for the unhappy case, the deserialisation error in the response body: it makes for a much more pleasant experience when trying to debug why an

This disables a lot of work, but sets us up to carefully reintroduce later.\r\n\r\nThe biggest changes are that we have several core constructs:\r\n- `Server` is the main application struct (formerly called `App`).\r\n- `Endpoint` (trait) is the endpoint people work with.\r\n- `Request` is what is is passed to `Endpoint` and represents an incoming request. (formerly called `Context`).\r\n- `Response` is what is returned from `Endpoint` and represents an outgoing response.\r\n\r\nBoth `Request` and `Response` operate with `AsyncRead`, and have shorthand methods to send and receive json, forms, querystrings, etc.\r\n\r\nI believe this should dramatically streamline the experience of using Tide, and overall make writing HTTP services a lot nicer!\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n__echo server__\r\n```rust\r\nlet app = tide::new();\r\napp.at(\"/echo\").get(|req| async move { req });\r\napp.listen(\"localhost:8080\").await?;\r\n```\r\n__hello world__\r\n```rust\r\nlet app = tide::new();\r\napp.at(\"/echo\").get(|_| async move { \"hello world\" });\r\napp.listen(\"localhost:8080\").await?;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n![Screenshot_2019-11-04 tide - Rust(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2467194/68343602-78abde00-00ed-11ea-95f6-486942a33f6c.png)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/350/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/350/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/345", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/345/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/345/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/345/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/tide/pull/345", "id": 516771877, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzM1OTg1OTQ5", "number": 345, "title": "Rewind page 1", "user": {"login": "yoshuawuyts", "id": 2467194, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjcxOTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2467194?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts", "html_url": "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-11-03T02:33:32Z", "updated_at": "2019-11-03T22:29:06Z", "closed_at": "2019-11-03T22:28:59Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/pulls/345", "html_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/tide/pull/345", "diff_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/tide/pull/345.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/http-rs/tide/pull/345.patch", "merged_at": "2019-11-03T22:28:59Z"}, "body": "Rewinds page 1 of https://github.com/http-rs/tide/issues/336.
