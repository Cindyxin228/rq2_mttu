https://github.com/rust-lang/log/issues/437\r\n\r\nThe `log` crate has an unstable structured logging API under the `kv_unstable` feature. In previous releases, if you specified both the `kv_unstable` and `std` features of `log` like so:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nlog = { features = [\"std\", \"kv_unstable\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou'd get support for standard library types in `log`'s structured logging API.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, this functionality is now gated under `kv_unstable_std`:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nlog = { features = [\"kv_unstable_std\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was made because we need to enable features in optional dependencies when both the `std` and `kv_unstable` features are enabled, which isn't currently supported by Cargo.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates this library to follow the new approach. It can be merged at any time and is currently non-blocking, but on 2020-01-18 the version of `log` requiring `kv_unstable_std` instead of `kv_unstable` and `std` will be published.\r\n\r\nThanks for trying out `log`'s structured logging API and sorry for any disruption! :bow:", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/776/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":

There is still some duplicate code left between the `Route::method` and `'Route::all` but factoring this out will probably require some lambda magic and will not improve readablilty.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nA check to see if there was middleware present was done in the same way in several places. This small refactoring moves\r\nthat check into the code that adds middleware onto an endpoint. This reduces code duplication and improves readability\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nMiddleware has decent test coverage. The tests that touch this piece of code still succeed. This code does not add any functionality so no additional tests should be neccesary.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [X] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [X] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/700/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/http-rs/tide/issues/700/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
