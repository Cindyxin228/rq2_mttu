There have been a number of breaking releases of Ploutos fixing bugs, improving performance and simplifying its use:\r\n\r\n- [v2](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github/releases/v2.0.0) checks for RPM scriptlet errors, eliminates 23 annoying Github workflow run warnings (caused by deprecated actions and the coming upgrade by GH to NodeJS 16) and introduces (optional) support for systemd unit management in RPM scriptlets. This PR adopts the new RPM systemd unit management behaviour. A check of the new managed behaviour vs the old manual behaviour shows that the only difference is use of newer systemctl command syntax on systems that support it, e.g. use of `--now` to achieve in one command what requires two commands on older systemd versions. The new systemd managed script fragments also include an explicit `systemd-reload`.\r\n\r\n- [v3](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github/releases/v3.0.0) simplified usage by folding the `xxx_rules_path` functionality into the `xxx_rules` workflow inputs., fixes an issue with `minimal` profile selection on older O/S's, and removes the need for manual specification of cross-compilation targets (these are now determined automatically from the other workflow inputs). This PR updates the `pkg` workflow to follow the `xxx_rules` changes.\r\n\r\n- [v4](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github/releases/v4.0.0) of the packaging workflow enables cross-compilation to take place in parallel with non-cross compilation thereby speeding up the workflow. In the case of Routinator this seems to reduce the time from ~16m to ~8m, about a 50% reduction!\r\n\r\n- [v5](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/ploutos/releases/tag/v5.0.0) simplified usage by removing the need to specify redundant DEB maintainer name/email and package testing rule inputs, and fixes issues with slow `yum` operations and broken DEB changelog generation.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Adjusts the inputs passed in `pkg.yml` to Ploutou to match the breaking changes made to Ploutos.\r\n  - Remove no longer supported or needed `deb_maintainer` Ploutos input.\r\n  - Remove no longer needed `cross_build_rules` Ploutos input and associated `pkg/rules/cross-targets.yml` file, Ploutos will determine cross-compilation targets itself based on the `package_build_rules` input.\r\n  - Remove no longer needed `package_test_rules` Ploutos input and associated `pkg/rules/packages-to-test.yml` file.\r\n  - Updates `pkg/rules/packages-to-build.yml` to include the `mode` key used by the Ploutos `pkg-test` job now that `packages-to-test.yml` no longer defines it.\r\n  - Replaces manual invocation of systemd commands in `pkg/rpm/scriptlets.toml` with the `#RPM_SYSTEMD_MACROS#` placeholder instead which Ploutos replaces at package building time with appropriate systemd commands (just as cargo-deb does for DEBs).\r\n- Re-orders and groups related Ploutos workflow inputs in `pkg.yml`.\r\n- Removes the unused minimal-cross cargo-deb variant from `Cargo.toml` and the related `pkg/common/routinator-minimal-cross.routinator.service` file.\r\n\r\nA test run of the `pkg` workflow in this PR branch can be seen here: https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/actions/runs/3591659903.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

This is fine because the encoded data is currently collected into a vec before any of this happens, so reading cannot fail other than from malformed Base 64 data.\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested by using the TAL currently available at https://routinator.do.nlnetlabs.nl/test/rrdp/ta.tal.\r\n\r\nThis is the same PR as #781 accept applied to the main branch.

#776\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the current Packaging `pkg.yml` and Packaging Docker `pkg-docker.yml` workflows with a much simpler Packaging `pkg.yml` workflow that outsources the behaviour to a new equivalent reusable workflow defined in the NLnet Labs organisation wide https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github repository, which includes the functionality of the above obsoleted PRs.\r\n\r\nAs with the obsoleted PRs, this PR updates the `Dockerfile` to support both `build` and `copy` modes for the non-cross and cross-compiled cases respectively.\r\n\r\nA successful test run against this PR branch can be seen here: https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/actions/runs/3052909026\r\n\r\nThe test run doesn't exercise the behaviour of pushing Docker images and manifests to Docker Hub as that only happens when a release Git tag (i.e. a tag named `v*` without a `-XXX` suffix) is pushed to this Git repository, but was tested elsewhere as part of the development of the centralized reusable workflow (e.g. [here](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github/pull/6#issuecomment-1244335732)).\r\n\r\nThe centralized reusable packaging workflow (see https://github.com/NLnetLabs/.github/blob/master/.github/workflows/pkg-rust.yml) needs more documentation, but in short it is the result of combining and normalizing various fixes and improvements that were added to the Krill and Routinator workflows over time. While similar to the `pkg.yml` workflow defined in this repository prior to this PR, it is sufficiently changed so as to make a direct comparison via diff quite difficult. Changes have been made to make the workflow more generic and reusable and thus for example the set of architectures and operating systems to build for is no longer hard-coded but now passed in as a set of rules, and the scripts to run to test installed packages post install and upgrade are now stored as separate files in the repo and passed by filepath reference to the reusable workflow.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR also modifies the way RPM scriptlets are defined because changes were needed to fix issues seen in the Krill and Routinator projects due to the limited way that the [`cargo-generate-rpm`](https://github.com/cat-in-136/cargo-generate-rpm) cargo helper command permits RPM scriptlets to be defined (i.e. they must be defined inline in TOML, they cannot be defined as references to Bash files stored separately).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/780/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/780/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/771", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/771/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/771/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/771/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/771", "id": 1343307197, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCH2k9849Z0Q3", "number": 771, "title": "Introduce WriteOrPanic trait for write!-ing without unwrap.", "user": {"login": "partim", "id": 1318494, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg0OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1318494?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim", "html_url": "https://github.com/partim", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/partim/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-08-18T15:56:44Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-19T12:04:47Z", "closed_at": "2022-08-19T12:04:42Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/pulls/771", "html_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/771", "diff_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/771.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/771.patch", "merged_at": "2022-08-19T12:04:42Z"}, "body": "This PR introduces a new utility trait `WriteOrPanic` which provides the method `write_fmt` that is used by `write!` macro and friends.

That\u2019s fine, as we only use with data that can be formatted and with types where writing itself can never fail (which I _think_ is the actual reason for returning a result).

yesterday](https://github.com/kornelski/cargo-deb/commit/ec4e00358bc3cc1abc6d3dd10f9bbf58f31a2cf5) and the [upstream issue](https://github.com/kornelski/cargo-deb/issues/12) was resolved. The new commit of cargo-deb `main` was then tested in [this Routinator `pkg` workflow run](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/actions/runs/2863785101).\r\n\r\nThe root cause was use of LZMA compression via O/S provided `xz` binary while older `dpkg` lacks support for LZMA compression. The fix was to not use O/S provided LZMA compression when the `lzma` feature of cargo-deb is disabled (which until now only disabled LZMA compression via cargo-deb Rust code but did not disable LZMA compression via O/S provided `xz` binary, if available).\r\n\r\nThis DRAFT PR is a placeholder to upgrade cargo-deb in our `pkg` workflow so that we are not held back to an old version which may cause much more work when we in future try and upgrade, and prevents us taking bug fixes and improvements from the cargo-deb project, or even raising issues against the project.\r\n\r\nOnce a new release of

They should have been `0.11.0~rc1` but were `0.11.0-rc1` meaning that our packaging system published them in the `main` package repo instead of the `proposed` package repo (where release candidates are supposed to be published). Anyone who upgraded packages with `yum` who had an older Routinator RPM installed will have been prompted to install (or if `-y` was used will have installed) the RC version even if they didn't have the `proposed` repo configured.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the versioning issue, and a separate PR on the packaging system itself adds a check to prevent publication of mixed proposed and non-proposed packages to prevent such a mistake getting to the final package repos.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a couple of other packaging issues discovered at the same time. Firstly the GitHub Actions cache wrongly contained the `target` directory, other versions of our packaging workflow (e.g. the one for Krill) don't have this. With this a previous run that generated one RPM filename can fetch that RPM back from the cache on a subsequent run and then fail because it produces two RPMs unexpectedly instead of one. It could probably also fail in more interesting and painful ways.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it also fixes the tag URL in the DEB package `debian/changelog` file to use the actual Git tag without a minus sign instead of a tilda (as the tilda is only in the package version, not in the application version).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/717/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues/717/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
