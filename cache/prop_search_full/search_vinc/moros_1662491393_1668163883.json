bug introduced in <code>v0.10.2</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.10.2 \u2013 2022-09-06</h1>\n<p>Fix for potential out-of-bound writes that were possible on <code>Heap</code> initialization and <code>Heap::extend</code>. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j\">security advisory</a> for details. The issues were fixed in the following way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initialization functions now panic if the given size is not large enough to store the necessary metadata. Depending on the alignment of the heap bottom pointer, the minimum size is between <code>2 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code> and <code>3 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>extend</code> method now panics when trying to extend an unitialized heap.</li>\n<li>Extend calls with a size smaller than <code>size_of::&lt;usize&gt;() * 2</code> are now buffered internally and not added to the list directly. The buffered region will be merged with future <code>extend</code> calls.</li>\n<li>The <code>size()</code> method now returns the <em>usable</em> size of the heap, which might be slightly smaller than the <code>top() - bottom()</code> difference because of alignment constraints.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/9e5878a3e3cc5481442c01e3bb1abde4cdd1f0bb\"><code>9e5878a</code></a> Release version 0.10.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/a59ceede621d9ad12313096e20bf6cd0c9a7b0ff\"><code>a59ceed</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/phil-opp/linked-list-allocator/issues/67\">#67</a> from rust-osdev/fix-miri</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/0f24df1cd015d36b0ace89449cb16768bf0f2df8\"><code>0f24df1</code></a> Fix out of bounds extend in test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/47a1de25630847b7d8f9e7b597a575ca6148dee0\"><code>47a1de2</code></a> Update test to make miri happy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/1c2c9bbafceb7b113b2177a77908717eb7065b80\"><code>1c2c9bb</code></a> Update changelog for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/phil-opp/linked-list-allocator/issues/68\">#68</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/168d791cfd690c9eb35cd5d6757e6197f119911f\"><code>168d791</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/phil-opp/linked-list-allocator/issues/68\">#68</a> from rust-osdev/fix-build-on-stable</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/a04699df1eb11901f933409e68665396bb1744d1\"><code>a04699d</code></a> Fix build on stable by adding missing field in <code>HoleList</code> initializer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/798c9c6313c769e3d234db933bb9e07bc06ff65f\"><code>798c9c6</code></a> Update badges</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/38df00529c54102340e3e1bccfae8b1b75cd694f\"><code>38df005</code></a> Trim trailing whitespace</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/5eb2bc6e671e15f3953e74e7b108cf59e724c2a0\"><code>5eb2bc6</code></a> Release version 0.10.2</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/phil-opp/linked-list-allocator/compare/v0.10.1...v0.10.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=linked_list_allocator&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.10.1&new-version=0.10.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
