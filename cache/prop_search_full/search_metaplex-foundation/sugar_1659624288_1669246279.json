struct:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\npub struct AwsConfig {\r\n    pub bucket: String,\r\n    pub profile: String,\r\n    pub directory: String,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows the user to set a AWS credentials profile other than `default` to give them more flexibility. In addition, it allows specifying an optional folder name to store the assets in the S3 bucket. If no folder is provided they will be stored at the root level. This lets users store multiple collections in a single bucket.\r\n\r\n![Selection_934](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1684605/184995582-5389d384-f257-49b0-a1db-f1b5a0690998.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, this changes the file names to use the standard
