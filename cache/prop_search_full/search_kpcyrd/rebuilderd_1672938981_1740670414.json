So this makes sense to also support, even though first it will target \"development\" (rawhide) basically a rolling release repository.\r\n\r\nThe work in this pull request only makes the scheduling work, for comparison to work a modified `fedora-repro-build` and `rebuilderd` is required as Fedora's build rpm's still contain unreproducible bits such as the signature and buildtime and `fedora-repro-build` for that purpose generates a json file which contains differences.\r\n\r\nSupport is [here](https://github.com/jelly/rebuilderd/commit/c70dc40cad1bf748a53525af47ce6e61dffd249e#diff-e3b51f1afcddc5e2d1017df5f36a3bcc5357fafdec99dcf9532b170cf8c24c78R41) to check that file but that doesn't fit the packages must exactly be the same with rebuild philosophy of rebuilderd.\r\n\r\nI would still like to merge this initial work, Fedora will setup a rebuilderd with patches for their custom comparison. We can later discuss if we want to integrate support this in rebuilderd or if build rpm's can insert the repository package signature and required metadata. For now I think it is beneficial to merge experimental support while further details are worked out.
