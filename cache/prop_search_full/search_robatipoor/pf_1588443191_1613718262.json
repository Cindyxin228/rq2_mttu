Which is kinda useless if you think about it; what for people mostly use pastebin tools? For transferring/sharing _big text dumps_. If you were to share a single-line text \u2014 would you send a link to the paste of the line, or just the line itself directly?\r\n\r\nHere's also my patch to fix this, I hope you like it, merge & release.
