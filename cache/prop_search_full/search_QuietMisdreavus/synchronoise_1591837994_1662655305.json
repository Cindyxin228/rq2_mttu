I bumped the `crossbeam-queue` to `0.3.5` and fixed the other deprecation warning from the Rust standard library.\r\n\r\nI am not very confident about my fix for the `compare_and_swap` and `compare_exchange`, if you want to take a look at something, please make sure that it is correct. I simply followed [the small migration guide that is on the documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicUsize.html#migrating-to-compare_exchange-and-compare_exchange_weak). The tests are passing but, that is maybe not enough.\r\n\r\nI think it could be great and non-breaking to bump the patch very of this crate, what do you think?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/QuietMisdreavus/synchronoise/issues/5/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/QuietMisdreavus/synchronoise/issues/5/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
