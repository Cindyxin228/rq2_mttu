Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Peternator7/strum (strum)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.26.3`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0263-strummacros)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/compare/v0.26.2...v0.26.3)\n\n-   [#&#8203;344](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/344): Hide `EnumTable` because it's going to be deprecated in the next\n    version.\n-   [#&#8203;357](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/357): Fixes an incompatiblity with `itertools` by using the fully\n    qualified name rather than the inherent method.\n-   [#&#8203;345](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/345): Allows unnamed tuple like variants to use their variants in\n    string interpolation. `#[strum(to_string = \"Field 0: {0}, Field 1: {1})\")]` will now work for tuple variants\n\n### [`v0.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0262)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/compare/v0.26.1...v0.26.2)\n\n-   [#&#8203;337](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/337): Fix missing generic impls for `EnumTryAs`\n-   [#&#8203;334](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/334): Support prefix in `AsRefStr`. Technically a breaking change,\n    but `prefix` was just added in `0.26.0` so it's a newer feature and it makes the feature more consisent in general.\n\n### [`v0.26.1`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0261)\n\n-   [#&#8203;325](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/325): use `core` instead of `std` in VariantArray.\n\n### [`v0.26.0`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0260)\n\n##### Breaking Changes\n\n-   The `EnumVariantNames` macro has been renamed `VariantNames`. The deprecation warning should steer you in\n    the right direction for fixing the warning.\n-   The Iterator struct generated by EnumIter now has new bounds on it. This shouldn't break code unless you manually\n    added the implementation in your code.\n-   `Display` now supports format strings using named fields in the enum variant. This should be a no-op for most code.\n    However, if you were outputting a string like `\"Hello {field}\"`, this will now be interpretted as a format string.\n-   EnumDiscriminant now inherits the repr and discriminant values from your main enum. This makes the discriminant type\n    closer to a mirror of the original and that's always the goal.\n\n##### New features\n\n-   The `VariantArray` macro has been added. This macro adds an associated constant `VARIANTS` to your enum. The constant\n    is a `&'static [Self]` slice so that you can access all the variants of your enum. This only works on enums that only\n    have unit variants.\n\n    ```rust\n    use strum::VariantArray;\n\n    #[derive(Debug, VariantArray)]\n    enum Color {\n      Red,\n      Blue,\n      Green,\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n      println!(\"{:?}\", Color::VARIANTS); // prints: [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"]\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   The `EnumTable` macro has been *experimentally* added. This macro adds a new type that stores an item for each variant\n    of the enum. This is useful for storing a value for each variant of an enum. This is an experimental feature because\n    I'm not convinced the current api surface area is correct.\n\n    ```rust\n    use strum::EnumTable;\n\n    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumTable)]\n    enum Color {\n      Red,\n      Blue,\n      Green,\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n      let mut counts = ColorTable::filled(0);\n      for color in &[Color::Red, Color::Red, Color::Green]] {\n        counts[color] += 1;\n      }\n\n      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Red], 2);\n      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Blue], 0);\n      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Green], 1);\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   `Display` has 2 new features:\n    -   the `strum(prefix = \"some_value\")` attribute on an enum now allows you to prepend a string onto every\n        variant when you serialize it.\n\n    -   Custom `to_string` and `serialize` attributes now support string interopolation on serialization.\n\n##### PR's Merged\n\n-   [#&#8203;322](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/322): avoid collisions on `std::fmt::Debug`\n-   [#&#8203;321](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/321): avoid conflicts with consecutive underscores.\n-   [#&#8203;314](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/314): add additional bounds to EnumIterator\n-   [#&#8203;311](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/311): add FusedIterator bounds to EnumIterator\n-   [#&#8203;297](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/297): New macro, add `VariantArray`\n-   [#&#8203;296](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/296): adds prefix attribute to To/From String macros.\n-   [#&#8203;294](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/294): use named enum fields in to_string macro.\n-   [#&#8203;288](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/288): discriminant enums now inherit the repr from the original enum.\n-   [#&#8203;279](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/279): Add `EnumTable` macro to generate a mapping between fieldless variants and data.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

That is, `\\<` and `\\>`. The minimum supported Rust\nversion has also been raised to 1.65, which was released about one year ago.\n\nThe new word boundary assertions are:\n\n-   `\\<` or `\\b{start}`: a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the left,\n    `\\w` on the right).\n-   `\\>` or `\\b{end}`: a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\w` on the left, `\\W|\\z`\n    on the right)).\n-   `\\b{start-half}`: half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\A` on the\n    left).\n-   `\\b{end-half}`: half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (`\\W|\\z` on the\n    right).\n\nThe `\\<` and `\\>` are GNU extensions to POSIX regexes. They have been added\nto the `regex` crate because they enjoy somewhat broad support in other regex\nengines as well (for example, vim). The `\\b{start}` and `\\b{end}` assertions\nare aliases for `\\<` and `\\>`, respectively.\n\nThe `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` assertions are not found in any\nother regex engine (although regex engines with general look-around support\ncan certainly express them). They were added principally to support the\nimplementation of word matching in grep programs, where one generally wants to\nbe a bit more flexible in what is considered a word boundary.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;469](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469):\n    Add support for `\\<` and `\\>` word boundary assertions.\n-   [FEATURE(regex-automata) #&#8203;1031](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1031):\n    DFAs now have a `start_state` method that doesn't use an `Input`.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1051](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1051):\n    Unicode character class operations have been optimized in `regex-syntax`.\n-   [PERF #&#8203;1090](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1090):\n    Make patterns containing lots of literal characters use less memory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;1046](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1046):\n    Fix a bug that could result in incorrect match spans when using a Unicode word\n    boundary and searching non-ASCII strings.\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1047](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1047):\n    Fix panics that can occur in `Ast->Hir` translation (not reachable from `regex`\n    crate).\n-   [BUG(regex-syntax) #&#8203;1088](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1088):\n    Remove guarantees in the API that connect the `u` flag with a specific HIR\n    representation.\n\n`regex-automata` breaking change release:\n\nThis release includes a `regex-automata 0.4.0` breaking change release, which\nwas necessary in order to support the new word boundary assertions. For\nexample, the `Look` enum has new variants and the `LookSet` type now uses `u32`\ninstead of `u16` to represent a bitset of look-around assertions. These are\noverall very minor changes, and most users of `regex-automata` should be able\nto move to `0.4` from `0.3` without any changes at all.\n\n`regex-syntax` breaking change release:\n\nThis release also includes a `regex-syntax 0.8.0` breaking change release,\nwhich, like `regex-automata`, was necessary in order to support the new word\nboundary assertions. This release also includes some changes to the `Ast`\ntype to reduce heap usage in some cases. If you are using the `Ast` type\ndirectly, your code may require some minor modifications. Otherwise, users of\n`regex-syntax 0.7` should be able to migrate to `0.8` without any code changes.\n\n`regex-lite` release:\n\nThe `regex-lite 0.1.1` release contains support for the new word boundary\nassertions. There are no breaking changes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
