[#&#8203;344](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/344): Hide `EnumTable` because it's going to be deprecated in the next\n    version.\n-   [#&#8203;357](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/357): Fixes an incompatiblity with `itertools` by using the fully\n    qualified name rather than the inherent method.\n-   [#&#8203;345](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/345): Allows unnamed tuple like variants to use their variants in\n    string interpolation. `#[strum(to_string = \"Field 0: {0}, Field 1: {1})\")]` will now work for tuple variants\n\n### [`v0.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0262)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/compare/v0.26.1...v0.26.2)\n\n-   [#&#8203;337](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/337): Fix missing generic impls for `EnumTryAs`\n-   [#&#8203;334](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/334): Support prefix in `AsRefStr`. Technically a breaking change,\n    but `prefix` was just added in `0.26.0` so it's a newer feature and it makes the feature more consisent in general.\n\n### [`v0.26.1`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0261)\n\n-   [#&#8203;325](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/325): use `core` instead of `std` in VariantArray.\n\n### [`v0.26.0`](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0260)\n\n##### Breaking Changes\n\n-   The `EnumVariantNames` macro has been renamed `VariantNames`. The deprecation warning should steer you in\n    the right direction for fixing the warning.\n-   The Iterator struct generated by EnumIter now has new bounds on it. This shouldn't break code unless you manually\n    added the implementation in your code.\n-   `Display` now supports format strings using named fields in the enum variant. This should be a no-op for most code.\n    However, if you were outputting a string like `\"Hello {field}\"`, this will now be interpretted as a format string.\n-   EnumDiscriminant now inherits the repr and discriminant values from your main enum. This makes the discriminant type\n    closer to a mirror of the original and that's always the goal.\n\n##### New features\n\n-   The `VariantArray` macro has been added. This macro adds an associated constant `VARIANTS` to your enum. The constant\n    is a `&'static [Self]` slice so that you can access all the variants of your enum. This only works on enums that only\n    have unit variants.\n\n    ```rust\n    use strum::VariantArray;\n\n    #[derive(Debug, VariantArray)]\n    enum Color {\n      Red,\n      Blue,\n      Green,\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n      println!(\"{:?}\", Color::VARIANTS); // prints: [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"]\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   The `EnumTable` macro has been *experimentally* added. This macro adds a new type that stores an item for each variant\n    of the enum. This is useful for storing a value for each variant of an enum. This is an experimental feature because\n    I'm not convinced the current api surface area is correct.\n\n    ```rust\n    use strum::EnumTable;\n\n    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumTable)]\n    enum Color {\n      Red,\n      Blue,\n      Green,\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n      let mut counts = ColorTable::filled(0);\n      for color in &[Color::Red, Color::Red, Color::Green]] {\n        counts[color] += 1;\n      }\n\n      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Red], 2);\n      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Blue], 0);\n      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Green], 1);\n    }\n    ```\n\n-   `Display` has 2 new features:\n    -   the `strum(prefix = \"some_value\")` attribute on an enum now allows you to prepend a string onto every\n        variant when you serialize it.\n\n    -   Custom `to_string` and `serialize` attributes now support string interopolation on serialization.\n\n##### PR's Merged\n\n-   [#&#8203;322](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/322): avoid collisions on `std::fmt::Debug`\n-   [#&#8203;321](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/321): avoid conflicts with consecutive underscores.\n-   [#&#8203;314](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/314): add additional bounds to EnumIterator\n-   [#&#8203;311](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/311): add FusedIterator bounds to EnumIterator\n-   [#&#8203;297](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/297): New macro, add `VariantArray`\n-   [#&#8203;296](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/296): adds prefix attribute to To/From String macros.\n-   [#&#8203;294](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/294): use named enum fields in to_string macro.\n-   [#&#8203;288](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/288): discriminant enums now inherit the repr from the original enum.\n-   [#&#8203;279](https://redirect.github.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/279): Add `EnumTable` macro to generate a mapping between fieldless variants and data.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
