#36\r\n\r\n\r\n## Synopsis\r\n\r\nCurrently parsing fails on:\r\n\r\n```gherkin\r\n#comment\r\n@tag\r\nFeature: feature\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe problem is `nl()` rule currently tries to parse newline and then `comment()` rule. It leads to a recursion and possible stack overflow and can't parse file, that begins with a comment. Adding a newline to a beginning of the file removes error.\r\n\r\nParse comment first and then newline. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- Created PR:\r\n    - [x] In [draft mode][l:1]\r\n    - [x] Name contains `Draft: ` prefix\r\n    - [x] Name contains issue reference\r\n    - [x] Has assignee\r\n- [x] Documentation is updated (if required)\r\n- [x] Tests are updated (if required)\r\n- [x] Changes conform code style\r\n- [x] CHANGELOG entry is added (if required)\r\n- [x] FCM (final commit message) is posted\r\n    - [x] and approved\r\n- [x] [Review][l:2] is completed and changes are approved\r\n- Before merge:\r\n    - [x] Milestone is set\r\n    - [x] PR's name and description are correct and up-to-date\r\n    - [x] `Draft: ` prefix is removed\r\n    - [x] All temporary labels are removed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[l:1]: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests\r\n[l:2]: https://help.github.com/en/articles/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber-rs/gherkin/issues/37/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber-rs/gherkin/issues/37/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
