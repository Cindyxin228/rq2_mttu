is not allowed\r\n- The code should be improved to avoid Vecs and clone in order to follow Pinocchio principles by using zero copy and avoid heap allocations.\r\n- In this code I implemented a custom serialization to avoid Borsh but we can easily revert back to borsh.\r\n- All the instructions are in the instruction folder but I can store them as per SDK example\r\n- All instructions and helpers have been updated to use Pinocchio structs and implementations\r\n\r\nLet me know what changes you want to see and I shall do them but this is pretty much an re-implementation of the SDK to
