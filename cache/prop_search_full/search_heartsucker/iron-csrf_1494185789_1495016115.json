Unfortunately, this doesn't work, because the linker doesn't know to how to link *ring*'s C/asm code correctly in that kind of situation. *ring* 0.9.3 added a flag to its Cargo.toml to tell the Rust toolchain to stop allowing multiple versions of *ring* to be linked into the same program, to prevent any problems this may cause.\r\n\r\n*ring* 0.9.4 was released with an update to make some crates easier to update to 0.9.x.\r\n\r\nNote that this requires cookie-rs 0.8.0 to be released, because the previous version of cookie-rs depended on *ring* 0.7.6, which would cause exactly the kind of multi-linking problem that this is trying to (in the end) prevent.
