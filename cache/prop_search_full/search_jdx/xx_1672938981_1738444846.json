Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [bzip2](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs) | dependencies | minor | `0.4` -> `0.5` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs (bzip2)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.5.0`](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/releases/tag/v0.5.0): Version 0.5.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/compare/0.4.4...v0.5.0)\n\nThe 0.5.0 release is the first release in ~2 years. It sets an msrv of 1.65.0 and pins the 2021 edition. If the msrv or edition are a problem for your project: just stick with the 0.4.4 release.\n\nThe repository has moved from [@&#8203;alexcrichton](https://redirect.github.com/alexcrichton) to [@&#8203;trifectatechfoundation](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation), which takes on its maintainership from this point forward.\n\nThe main new feature of this release is the `libbz2-rs-sys` feature flag, which uses the pure rust https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/libbzip2-rs implementation of bzip2. Being all rust, and using (by default) the rust allocator infrastructure, cross-compilation (e.g. to webassembly) should be much easier.\n\nBesides that, the documentation was modernized (we can cross-link now) and several bugs were fixed.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   update `partial_io` to version `0.5.4` by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108)\n-   Remove tokio support by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/109](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/109)\n-   support `libbz2-rs-sys` by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/110](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/110)\n-   set msrv to 1.65.0 by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/111](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/111)\n-   set the edition to 2021 by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/112](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/112)\n-   fix clippy warnings by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/113](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/113)\n-   update documentation by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/114](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/114)\n-   Don't enable the stdio feature for the rust implementation of bzip2 by [@&#8203;bjorn3](https://redirect.github.com/bjorn3) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117)\n-   Fix infinite loop after invalid data by [@&#8203;jongiddy](https://redirect.github.com/jongiddy) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99)\n-   prepare release 0.5.0 by [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/115](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/115)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n-   [@&#8203;folkertdev](https://redirect.github.com/folkertdev) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/108)\n-   [@&#8203;bjorn3](https://redirect.github.com/bjorn3) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/117)\n-   [@&#8203;jongiddy](https://redirect.github.com/jongiddy) made their first contribution in [https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99](https://redirect.github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/pull/99)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/bzip2-rs/compare/0.4.4...v0.5.0\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Friday\" in timezone America/Chicago, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Source](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/compare/v2.1.3...v2.1.4)\n\n##### <!-- 1 -->\ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\n\n-   fix([#&#8203;215](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/215)): Upgrade to deflate64 0.1.9\n-   Panic when reading a file truncated in the middle of an XZ block header\n-   Some archives with over u16::MAX files were handled incorrectly or slowly ([#&#8203;189](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/189))\n-   Check number of files when deciding whether a CDE is the real one\n-   Could still select a fake CDE over a real one in some cases\n-   May have to consider multiple CDEs before filtering for validity\n-   We now keep searching for a real CDE header after read an invalid one from the file comment\n-   Always search for data start when opening an archive for append, and reject the header if data appears to start after central directory\n-   `deep_copy_file` no longer allows overwriting an existing file, to match the behavior of `shallow_copy_file`\n-   File start position was wrong when extra data was present\n-   Abort file if central extra data is too large\n-   Overflow panic when central directory extra data is too large\n-   ZIP64 header was being written twice when copying a file\n-   ZIP64 header was being written to central header twice\n-   Start position was incorrect when file had no extra data\n-   Allow all reserved headers we can create\n-   Fix a bug where alignment padding interacts with other extra-data fields\n-   Fix bugs involving alignment padding and Unicode extra fields\n-   Incorrect header when adding AES-encrypted files\n-   Parse the extra field and reject it if invalid\n-   Incorrect behavior following a rare combination of `merge_archive`, `abort_file` and `deep_copy_file`.
