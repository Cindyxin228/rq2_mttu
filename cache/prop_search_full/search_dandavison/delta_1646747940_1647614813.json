The\r\nregex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks\r\ncaused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes.\r\nThose (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks.\r\nThis guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API.\r\nUnfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent\r\nuntrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's\r\npossible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible\r\nto perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to\r\nservices accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex\r\ncrate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include\r\nstarting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are\r\nrecommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate.\r\nUnfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are\r\npractically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this\r\nvulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic\r\nregexes.\r\n\r\nUpstream commit:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/ae70b41d4f46641dbc45c7a4f87954aea356283e\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24713\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/regex/security/advisories/GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/ae70b41d4f46641dbc45c7a4f87954aea356283e\r\nhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24713\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/NcNNL1Jq7Yw", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1015/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1015/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1013", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1013/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1013/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1013/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1013", "id": 1170385776, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC4j8g840gA_s", "number": 1013, "title": "Librarification: git-delta-lib", "user": {"login": "th1000s", "id": 78380144, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzgwMTQ0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78380144?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s", "html_url": "https://github.com/th1000s", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/th1000s/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2022-03-16T00:08:13Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-18T02:53:37Z", "closed_at": "2022-03-18T02:53:08Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/pulls/1013", "html_url": "https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1013", "diff_url": "https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1013.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1013.patch", "merged_at": "2022-03-18T02:53:08Z"}, "body": "Split delta into a binary (`git-delta`) and library (`git-delta-lib`) crate, and enable using the `main` function in the `git-delta` crate[1].
