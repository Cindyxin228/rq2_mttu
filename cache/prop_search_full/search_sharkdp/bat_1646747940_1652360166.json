Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.\r\n      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.\r\n- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running\r\n      `grep '^\\s*MIN_SUPPORTED_RUST_VERSION' .github/workflows/CICD.yml`.\r\n- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and\r\n      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with\r\n      `git grep -i -e 'rust.*1\\.' -e '1\\..*rust' | grep README | grep -v tests/`.\r\n- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.\r\n\r\n## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)\r\n\r\n- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install --locked -f --path .`) and make\r\n      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the\r\n      new version).\r\n- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Review `-h`, `--help`, and the `man` page. All of these are shown in\r\n      the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.\r\n      The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.\r\n\r\n## Pre-release checks\r\n\r\n- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the\r\n      next section).\r\n- [ ] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do\r\n      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes\r\n      and themes).\r\n- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will\r\n      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).\r\n\r\n## Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.\r\n      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.\r\n      REMINDER: If your `origin` is a fork, don't forget to push to e.g. `upstream` instead!\r\n- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new\r\n      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the\r\n      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and\r\n      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.\r\n      Publish the release.\r\n- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should\r\n      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).\r\n- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.\r\n      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.\r\n\r\n## Post-release\r\n\r\n- [x] Prepare a new \"unreleased\" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2192/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2192/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2190", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2190/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2190/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2190/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2190", "id": 1231551614, "node_id": "PR_kwDOB8a8wc43mO3p", "number": 2190, "title": "Make `INI` syntax register as handler of `.inf` files", "user": {"login": "Enselic", "id": 115040, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA0MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115040?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic", "html_url": "https://github.com/Enselic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Enselic/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-05-10T18:40:55Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-11T15:39:04Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-11T15:39:01Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/pulls/2190", "html_url": "https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2190", "diff_url": "https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2190.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2190.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-11T15:39:01Z"}, "body": "I discovered this while debugging an unexpected diff of `assets/syntaxes.bin` for the upcoming v0.21.0 release.\r\n\r\nWe need to type `inf` and `INF` as strings in `INI.sublime-syntax`,\r\notherwise `yaml-rust` interprets them as real numbers (\"infinity\") and\r\nthey do not get registered as file extensions:\r\n\r\n    /Users/martin/src/yaml-rust #

`PrettyPrinter` API.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible to use `bat` as a lib and configure this, but the workaround requires using `bat`'s \"inner\" API which is discouraged by `bat`'s documentation.\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nlet mut config = bat::config::Config::default();\r\nconfig.show_nonprintable = true;\r\nlet assets = bat::assets::HighlightingAssets::from_binary();\r\nlet ctrl = bat::controller::Controller::new(&config, &assets);\r\nlet inp = bat::input::Input::from(bat::Input::from_bytes(&output));\r\nctrl.run(vec![inp]).unwrap();\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce this PR is merged, consumers will be able to do this:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nbat::PrettyPrinter::new()\r\n    .input_from_bytes(&output)\r\n    .show_nonprintable(true)\r\n    .print()\r\n    .expect(\"Failed to print to STDOUT\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Something else noteworthy**: if using `bat` as a library, if binary content is detected then the `PrettyPrinter` will print:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[bat warning]: Binary content from READER will not be printed to the terminal (but will be present if the output of 'bat' is piped). You can use 'bat -A' to show the binary file contents.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this has been discussed previously, but I imagine it could cause some surprise for crates which depend on `bat` since the `-A` flag obviously isn't available, etc.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2142/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

<code>Clone</code> implementation for <code>OnceCell</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.10</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>upgrade <code>parking_lot</code> to <code>0.12.0</code> (note that this bumps MSRV with <code>parking_lot</code> feature enabled to <code>1.49.0</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.9</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an <code>atomic-polyfill</code> optional dependency to compile <code>race</code> on platforms without atomics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.8.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>try_insert</code> API -- a version of <code>set</code> that returns a reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.7.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve code size when using parking_lot feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.7.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <code>race::OnceBox&lt;T&gt;</code> to also impl <code>Default</code> even if <code>T</code> doesn't impl <code>Default</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.7.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide the <code>race</code> module behind (default) <code>race</code> feature.\nTurns out that adding <code>race</code> by default was a breaking change on some platforms without atomics.\nIn this release, we make the module opt-out.\nTechnically, this is a breaking change for those who use <code>race</code> with <code>no_default_features</code>.\nGiven that the <code>race</code> module itself only several days old, the breakage is deemed acceptable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.6.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>Lazy::into_value</code></li>\n<li>Stabilize <code>once_cell::race</code> module for &quot;first one wins&quot; no_std-compatible initialization flavor.</li>\n<li>Migrate from deprecated <code>compare_and_swap</code> to <code>compare_exchange</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.5.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>OnceBox</code> API uses <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.\nThis a breaking change to unstable API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.5.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>MSRV is increased to <code>1.36.0</code>.</li>\n<li>document <code>once_cell::race</code>
