<code>1.49.0</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.9</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an <code>atomic-polyfill</code> optional dependency to compile <code>race</code> on platforms without atomics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.8.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>try_insert</code> API -- a version of <code>set</code> that returns a reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.7.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve code size when using parking_lot feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.7.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <code>race::OnceBox&lt;T&gt;</code> to also impl <code>Default</code> even if <code>T</code> doesn't impl <code>Default</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.7.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide the <code>race</code> module behind (default) <code>race</code> feature.\nTurns out that adding <code>race</code> by default was a breaking change on some platforms without atomics.\nIn this release, we make the module opt-out.\nTechnically, this is a breaking change for those who use <code>race</code> with <code>no_default_features</code>.\nGiven that the <code>race</code> module itself only several days old, the breakage is deemed acceptable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.6.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>Lazy::into_value</code></li>\n<li>Stabilize <code>once_cell::race</code> module for &quot;first one wins&quot; no_std-compatible initialization flavor.</li>\n<li>Migrate from deprecated <code>compare_and_swap</code> to <code>compare_exchange</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.5.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>OnceBox</code> API uses <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.\nThis a breaking change to unstable API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.5.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>MSRV is increased to <code>1.36.0</code>.</li>\n<li>document <code>once_cell::race</code> module.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted
