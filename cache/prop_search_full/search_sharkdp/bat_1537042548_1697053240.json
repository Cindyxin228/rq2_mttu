#2444 and #2602:\r\n\r\n- Pass `--no-lessopen` to `less` to prevent it from preprocessing input a second file. ~~This should fix the intermittently failing test, assuming we correctly figured out the cause.~~ **Unfortunately, this did not appear to fix the intermittently failing test.**\r\n- Make `$LESSOPEN` support opt-in rather than on by default. I added a `--lessopen` flag to enable this and kept the `--no-lessopen` flag for people that add `--lessopen` to their config file, but want to override it for whatever reason. Also changed the tests, man page, and completions accordingly.\r\n- Require that `$LESSOPEN` has exactly one `%s`, otherwise ignoring it and with a warning message much like `less` does. Also changed the tests accordingly.\r\n- Along with updating CHANGELOG.md, I took the liberty of moving the entry for the `$LESSOPEN` PR from v0.22.0 to the unreleased features section since it wasn't updated before it was merged recently.\r\n- ~~I re-added the `lessopen` feature to `default` since you need to enable it with an option now anyways. I made sure to have this in its own commit so it can be easily removed if anyone objects to it.~~ Per @Enselic's [request](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2662#discussion_r1318883698), I removed it so it has a chance to get more testing before being enabled by default.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/bat/issues/2662/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0,

It means that it can avoid extra allocation by reusing the original string buffer when no character in the buffer was replaced while encoding.\r\n- Removing BOM is now handled by `encoding_rs` more efficiently thanks to [`encode_with_bom_removal`](https://docs.rs/encoding_rs/latest/encoding_rs/struct.Encoding.html#method.decode_with_bom_removal) methods.

(2023-04-21)</h1>\n<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where a regex match could be reported\nwhere none was found. Specifically, the bug occurs when a pattern contains some\nliteral prefixes that could be extracted <em>and</em> an optional word boundary in the\nprefix.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/981\">#981</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/981\">rust-lang/regex#981</a>):\nFix a bug where a word boundary could interact with prefix literal\noptimizations and lead to a false positive match.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.8.0 (2023-04-20)</h1>\n<p>This is a sizeable release that will be soon followed by another sizeable\nrelease. Both of them will combined close over 40 existing issues and PRs.</p>\n<p>This first release, despite its size, essentially represents preparatory work\nfor the second release, which will be even bigger. Namely, this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.0, which was released about 1 year ago.</li>\n<li>Upgrades its dependency on <code>aho-corasick</code> to the recently released 1.0\nversion.</li>\n<li>Upgrades its dependency on <code>regex-syntax</code> to the simultaneously released\n<code>0.7</code> version. The changes to <code>regex-syntax</code> principally revolve around a\nrewrite of its literal extraction code and a number of simplifications and\noptimizations to its high-level intermediate representation (HIR).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second release, which will follow ~shortly after the release above, will\ncontain a soup-to-nuts rewrite of every regex engine. This will be done by\nbringing <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata\"><code>regex-automata</code></a> into\nthis repository, and then changing the <code>regex</code> crate to be nothing but an API\nshim layer on top of <code>regex-automata</code>'s API.</p>\n<p>These tandem releases are the culmination of about 3\nyears of on-and-off work that <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656\">began in earnest in March\n2020</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of the scale of changes involved in these releases, I would love to\nhear about your experience.

This same race is present in rust versions prior to 1.58.1.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generalized temporary files: <code>NamedTempFile</code> can now abstract over different kinds of files (e.g.,\nunix domain sockets, pipes, etc.):\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>Builder::make</code> and <code>Builder::make_in</code> for generalized temp file\ncreation.</li>\n<li>Add <code>NamedTempFile::from_parts</code> to complement <code>NamedTempFile::into_parts</code>.</li>\n<li>Add generic parameter to <code>NamedTempFile</code> to support wrapping non-File types.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bug Fixes/Improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't try to create a temporary file multiple times if the file path has been fully specified by\nthe user (no random characters).</li>\n<li><code>NamedTempFile::persist_noclobber</code> is now always atomic on linux when <code>renameat_with</code> is\nsupported. Previously, it would first link the new path, then unlink the previous path.</li>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings on windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trivia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch from <code>libc</code> to <code>rustix</code> on wasi/unix. This now makes direct syscalls instead of calling\nthrough libc.</li>\n<li>Remove <code>remove_dir_all</code> dependency. The rust standard library has optimized their internal version\nsignificantly.</li>\n<li>Switch to official windows-sys windows bindings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breaking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The minimum rust version is now <code>1.48.0</code>.</li>\n<li>Mark most functions as <code>must_use</code>.</li>\n<li>Uses direct syscalls on linux by default, instead of libc.</li>\n<li>The new type parameter in <code>NamedTempFile</code> may lead to type inference issues in some cases.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/commits\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=tempfile&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=3.3.0&new-version=3.5.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

bump\r\n\r\n- [x] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.\r\n      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.\r\n- [x] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running\r\n      `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1 | jq -r '.packages[0].rust_version'`.\r\n- [x] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and\r\n      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with\r\n      `git grep -i -e 'rust.*1\\.' -e '1\\..*rust' | grep README | grep -v tests/`.\r\n- [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. Introduce a section for the new release.\r\n\r\n## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)\r\n\r\n- [x] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install --locked -f --path .`) and make\r\n      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the\r\n      new version).\r\n- [x] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Review [`-h`](./short-help.txt), [`--help`](./long-help.txt), and the `man` page. The `man` page is shown in\r\n      the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.\r\n      The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.\r\n\r\n## Pre-release checks\r\n\r\n- [x] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the\r\n      next section).\r\n- [x] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do\r\n      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes\r\n      and themes).\r\n- [x] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will\r\n      succeed later (after creating the GitHub release).\r\n\r\n## Release\r\n\r\n- [x] Create a tag and push it: `git tag vX.Y.Z; git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`.\r\n      This will trigger the deployment via GitHub Actions.\r\n      REMINDER: If your `origin` is a fork, don't forget to push to e.g. `upstream` instead!\r\n- [x] Go to https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/new to create the new\r\n      release. Select the new tag and also use it as the release title. For the\r\n      release notes, copy the corresponding section from `CHANGELOG.md` and\r\n      possibly add additional remarks for package maintainers.\r\n      Publish the release.\r\n- [x] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should\r\n      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).\r\n- [x] Publish to crates.io by running `cargo publish` in a *clean* repository.\r\n      The safest way to do this is to clone a fresh copy.\r\n\r\n## Post-release\r\n\r\n- [x] Prepare a new \"unreleased\" section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n      Put this at the top:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# unreleased\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n## Syntaxes\r\n\r\n## Themes\r\n\r\n## `bat` as a library\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
