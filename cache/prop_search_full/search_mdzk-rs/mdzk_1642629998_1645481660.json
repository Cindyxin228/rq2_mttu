renderer at a deep level, we will have to create our own custom renderer. This will be inspired by the mdBook `HandlebarsRenderer`, but with all the unecessary parts stripped out. Having our own renderer will also allow us to customize the theme from the ground up, letting us create a more unique experience.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\n- [x] Make mdzk renderer the default option\r\n- [x] Allow adding custom CSS, either through the config file or in a separate CSS-file\r\n    - [x] Modify variables in `variables.css` directly in the config file\r\n- [x] Make complete customized style\r\n    - [x] Styling of tables\r\n    - [x] Decide on code font\r\n    - [x] Code highlighting\r\n    - [x] mdzk \"watermark\" on the bottom of the sidebar\r\n    - [x] Styling of date\r\n    - [x] Styling of footnotes\r\n    - [x] Styling of backlinks\r\n    - [x] New searchbar style\r\n    - [x] Style for `class=\"missing-link\"` (do not style the HTML element)\r\n    - [x] Copy over and load mdBook style for changing\r\n- [x] Favicon\r\n- [x] TOC sidebar\r\n    - [x] Fix folding and section numbers option\r\n    - [x] [`is_draft_chapter`](https://docs.rs/mdbook/0.4.13/mdbook/book/struct.Chapter.html#method.is_draft_chapter) is used in the official renderer to gray out the note in the index. I would perhaps prefer the entry to disappear completely when marked as a draft. Discuss the correct approach.\r\n- [x] Wrong escaping in sidebar links. mdBook naively uses the file path as the href, which breaks when using characters like `?` in the title. See [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/48b5e52f62b35c4e4df21cc3b394d45fef365e8f/src/renderer/html_handlebars/helpers/toc.rs#L118) for more details on mdBook's solution.\r\n- [x] Search functionality\r\n    - [x] Add title of note to search index\r\n- [x] Hook into the pulldown-cmark parsing to change all links with filetype `.md` into `.html` (or strip the extension completely).\r\n    - [x] This is based on regexes. Would like a simpler/faster solution here.\r\n- [x] Copy over fonts\r\n- [x] Load CSS file(s) into output directory\r\n- [x] Investigate whether to use [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/browser.html) to handle all math rendering on the client side.\r\n    - [x] Don't load KaTeX from CDN\r\n- [x] Handlebars: Define which keys/values are needed in the theme (@distromari). `{{content}}` will contain the actual rendered note content, but we also have `{{title}}` and such. \r\n- [x] Basic rendering of Markdown to HTML with [pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/66/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mdzk-rs/mdzk/issues/66/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
