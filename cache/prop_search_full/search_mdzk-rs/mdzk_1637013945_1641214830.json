It sometimes splits the Text event into several pieces. When the split occurs inside a LaTeX entry, the entry is split into two and it is not converted into KaTeX. The best way to solve this is by using a new function that clears up the buffer until it sees an unmatched $ sign. \r\n\r\nAnother problem that causes this issue is that the Text event does not contain the links as-is. So when there is a link like\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Some Text](link.md)\r\n```\r\nThe buffer only has Some Text. Because of this, running ch.content.replacen() does not work since the buffer does not have the identical string as ch.content.\r\n\r\n#
