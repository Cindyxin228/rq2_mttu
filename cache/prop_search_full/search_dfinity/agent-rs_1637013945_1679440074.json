The main crate is written in Rust and it will be compiled to WASM so it can be used in JS from the Service Worker. Because it will run in a browser WASM runtime we need to careful with the file size and also need to be weary of dependencies that are not compatible with this runtime. Moving these types into a separate crate allows us to share these types without pulling in the dependency tree of `ic-agent`.\r\n\r\nOriginal PR: https://github.com/dfinity/ic-types/pull/26

refactors:\r\n\r\n- `PasswordManager::get` simplifies usage\r\n- Remove `default-features` from `ic-utils`'s import of `ic-agent` (lets `icx-proxy` completely remove `reqwest` from dependency tree)\r\n- Remove superfluous `Principal::to_text` call in formatting code (`to_text` just calls `Display` anyway)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with

NCC-DITY002-016)\r\n> An ECDSA signature over a 256-bit curve consists of a pair of values (r, s), each 32 bytes\r\nin length. The sign() function in secp256k1.rs implements such signature generation for\r\nSecp256k1Identity leveraging OpenSSL\u2019s EcdsaSig::sign() function:\r\n> The values r and s are concatenated and passed on for encoding. The highlighted lines\r\ncompute array offsets based on the length of r and s, and may cause this function to panic if\r\nthe length of r or s is greater than 32 bytes (due to negative index), or to silently proceed with\r\nincorrect data if either is less than 32 bytes. These values are generated by OpenSSL, and will\r\nalmost certainly be the expected lengths if the signing operation is successful; however, the\r\ncode proceeds to compute indexes based on the returned lengths, rather than assuming or\r\nverifying the lengths are correct.\r\n> In general, it is safest to validate sensitive parameters before relying on them.

constructible from values in a one-liner if you don't need builder syntax but are calling a function that requires one\n- `WalletCanister::call`/`call64`/`call128` now take `Principal` instead of `Canister`. Every element of the canister's configuration was ignored except the principal, so this avoids misleading callers as well as not requiring constructing do-nothing canisters for cases like `Principal::management_canister`.\n- `call_forward` is removed. Same story - all configuration is ignored, so wrapping the high-level abstraction makes no sense if it's not used. It also was not usable with interface functions in the first place, which is so centrally the use-case that I thought it couldn't be used at all not thinking to check `update_`.", "reactions": {"url":
