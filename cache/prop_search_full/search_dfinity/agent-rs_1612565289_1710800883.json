[development](https://gitlab.com/dfinity-lab/public/ic/-/tree/master/rs/boundary_node/discower_bowndary?ref_type=heads)) is the prerequisite for the [IC-720: BN Decentralization Feature](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-node-roadmap/15562). This library will have two main responsibilities:\r\n1. **Discovery of the API Boundary Nodes (domains)**.  Users (clients) of the IC need to know, which domains to use when \"talking\" to the IC. Currently, there is only one domain `ic0.app` owned by _Dfinity_. However, once BNs are decentralized, each BN will have it's own/unique domain. Moreover, BNs and their domain records could be added (or removed) from the IC registry via nns proposals. Thus, clients would need an api to discover, which domains currently belong to the IC ecosystem. _Note_: the exact BN domain discovery mechanism is still being discussed.  This could either be accomplished via [read_state](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#http-read-state) calls or by fetching records from the registry canister.\r\n3. **Routing - dynamically providing url (BN domain) on demand**\r\n\r\n**Future usages of the library**:\r\n- browsers\r\n- http gateway\r\n- icx proxy\r\n\r\nThe library is being developed within the [ic](https://gitlab.com/dfinity-lab/public/ic/-/tree/master/rs/boundary_node/discower_bowndary?ref_type=heads) repo and it uses `ic-agent` as a dependency. However, in the near future, `ic-agent` could/should include some functionalities of the library or even library as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis pull request kicks-off the first migration/integration step of the library with the `ic-agent`.\r\nNamely,  `ic-agent` is extended with a custom `RouteProvider` feature.\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing tests should fully cover the e2e functionality of the `RoundRobinRouteProvider` which is now used as default route provider for the `agent`.\r\n- In addition, several unit tests were added for the `RoundRobinRouteProvider`.\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [x] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/agent-rs/issues/484/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

Interface Specification change [IC-1462](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pull/143).\r\n\r\nWe need to do some changes in IC-Agent to handle HTTP responses with code 200 for `Call` requests as that indicates there is a CBOR encoded error message in the body.\r\n\r\nIt is a breaking change due to the enum variant `AgentErrror::ReplicaError` now being a tuple struct with attributes matching the new specification. \r\n\r\nFixes #421\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTwo integration tests have been added in `agent_test.rs` to test the flow where a call request is rejected with status code 200.\r\nPrevious tests for queries have also been updated where `AgentError::ReplicaError` is expected as a response.\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [x] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IC-1462]: https://dfinity.atlassian.net/browse/IC-1462?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ", "reactions": {"url":
