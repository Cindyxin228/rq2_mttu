has some unwrap() calls instead of error checking, and panics on connect failure.  This surfaces in the two tests that this PR updates.\r\n\r\nThe result is that dfx has to restart the http gateway more than once, until it finally comes up after the replica is healthy.  Sometimes this exceeds the 15 second timeout in these tests.\r\n\r\nThe panics are fixed in https://github.com/dfinity/ic/pull/1029 but that fix will take a while to land here.\r\n\r\n# How Has This

Tested?\r\n\r\nI created a test project called `hello` and added it to my dfx.json. Then I added \r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"malformed\": {\r\n      \"remote\": {\r\n        \"id\": {\r\n          \"local\": \"hptcf-emaaa-aaaaa-qaawq-cai\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nunder `\"canisters\"` in dfx.json. Here is the result of running `dfx deploy hello` on dfx 0.20.1: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\u276f dfx deploy hello                                                                                              \r\nDeploying: hello\r\nAll canisters have already been created.\r\nBuilding canisters...\r\nWARN: Canister 'malformed' has no .did file configured.\r\nWARN: .did file for canister 'hello_assets' does not exist.\r\nError: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.\r\nCaused by: Failed to build all canisters.\r\nCaused by: Failed while trying to build all canisters.\r\nCaused by: Failed while trying to build all canisters in the canister pool.\r\nCaused by: Failed to build dependencies graph for canister pool.\r\nCaused by: Failed to get dependencies for canister 'malformed'.\r\nCaused by: Failed to create <Type>CanisterInfo for canister 'malformed'.\r\nCaused by: `main` attribute is required on Motoko canisters in dfx.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see how adding this entry to `dfx.json` has caused `dfx deploy hello` to fail for no apparent reason. You even get a weird message complaining about motoko despite never having mentioned motoko in the entry for `malformed`.\r\n\r\nHere is the result with a version of dfx I just built from this branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u276f ./dfx deploy hello\r\nDeploying: hello\r\nAll canisters have already been created.\r\nBuilding canisters...\r\nWARN: Canister 'malformed' has no .did file configured.\r\nWARN: .did file for canister 'hello_assets' does not exist.\r\n  Installed dfx 0.21.0-beta.0+rev13.dirty-ae5c7f33 to cache.\r\nInstalling canisters...\r\nInstalling code for canister hello, with canister ID bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai\r\nDeployed canisters.\r\nURLs:\r\n  Frontend canister via browser\r\n    hello_assets:\r\n      - http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai\r\n      - http://bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai.localhost:8000/\r\n  Backend canister via Candid interface:\r\n    hello: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai\r\n    sns_governance: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai&id=be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai\r\n    sns_index: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai&id=br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai\r\n    sns_ledger: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai&id=bw4dl-smaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai\r\n    sns_root: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai&id=b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai\r\n    sns_swap: http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=avqkn-guaaa-aaaaa-qaaea-cai&id=by6od-j4aaa-aaaaa-qaadq-cai\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the deployment succeeds\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nBuild the canister dependency graph only for the requested canisters, instead of building it for all canisters.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this is that sometimes `canister.builder.get_dependencies` returns an error for some canisters, as those canisters are not properly formed (e.g. they are Motoko canisters with no `main` field). In this case, you could still theoretically call `dfx deploy <canister>` and you might expect dfx to not complain that some unrelated canisters in your dfx.json are not properly formed. By only calling `canister.builder.get_dependencies` on canisters that are actually needed for building the canister being deployed, we can avoid this from happening.\r\n\r\nOf course, `dfx deploy` without specifying a canister will still not work. But it seems to be common for people to use `dfx deploy <canister>` this way, as both I and @dskloetd have run into this before and that is just the cases I know about. And I think it is not a great user experience to have `dfx deploy <canister>` not work in this case when it easily could. \r\n\r\nI would also like to add an automated test but I'm not sure how.\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] The title of this PR complies with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\r\n- [x] I have edited the CHANGELOG accordingly.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/3818/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/3818/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/3817", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/3817/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/3817/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/issues/3817/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3817", "id": 2388121026, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC9J92c50TKa7", "number": 3817, "title": "chore!: --with-cycles requires --wallet is enforced earlier", "user": {"login": "viviveevee", "id": 14757975, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzU3OTc1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14757975?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee", "html_url": "https://github.com/viviveevee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/viviveevee/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-07-03T09:17:46Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-03T14:53:42Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-03T14:53:41Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/sdk/pulls/3817", "html_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3817", "diff_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3817.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3817.patch", "merged_at": "2024-07-03T14:53:41Z"}, "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nInternal [complaint](https://dfinity.slack.com/archives/CGA566TPV/p1719989491013429):\r\n>If I pass arguments that won't work, such as --with-cycles without --wallet, it would be nice to get an error about that before walking though the entire interactive wizard.\r\n\r\nWith this change the user will see the error message instantly.
