In particular, if the future is never awaited, then the inter-canister call is not performed at all. Otherwise, firing the call is postponed to the code location that awaits the future.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nGiven the current semantics of `CallFuture`, it is possible that the inter-canister call is fired from a call context C that creates the future while the future is only awaited in another call context D. Depending on the actual message scheduling, this leads to one of the following scenarios:\r\n- the future has already finished execution when it is awaited in the call context D: then the continuation after the await is executed in the call context D (as expected);\r\n- the future has not yet finished execution when it is awaited in the call context D: then the execution of call context D is suspended (and potentially starved if D has no outstanding calls at this point) and the continuation after the await point is executed in the call context C (which is *unexpected*).\r\n\r\nWe can exemplify the unexpected case with the code snippet below (thanks to @crusso ):\r\n```\r\nthread_local! {\r\n    pub static CELL: RefCell<Vec<Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<(u32,), (RejectionCode, String)>> + Send>>>> = RefCell::new(vec![]);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[update]\r\nasync fn task() -> u32 {\r\n  ic_cdk::api::print(\"task\");\r\n  return 888;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[update]\r\nasync fn writer() -> u32 {\r\n  print(\"writer\");\r\n  CELL.with(|v| {v.borrow_mut().push(Box::pin(call::<(),(u32,)>(id(),\"task\",())))});\r\n  call::<(),(u32,)>(id(),\"task\",()).await;\r\n  42\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[update]\r\nasync fn reader() ->  u32  {\r\n  print(\"reader\");\r\n  let o = CELL.with(|v| { v.borrow_mut().pop() });\r\n  match o {\r\n      Some(f) => {\r\n          f.await.unwrap();\r\n          print(\"returning 666 from reader?\");\r\n          return 666;\r\n      }\r\n      None => {\r\n          call::<(),(u32,)>(id(),\"reader\",()).await;\r\n          return 1;\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[update]\r\nasync fn go() {\r\n    let y = call::<(),(u32,)>(id(),\"writer\",());\r\n    let x = call::<(),(u32,)>(id(),\"reader\",()).await;\r\n    let w = y.await;\r\n    print(format!(\"reader: {:?}\", x));\r\n    print(format!(\"writer: {:?}\", w));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere a future stored in `CELL` is created in the call context of `writer` (call context C in the description above) and awaited in the call context of `reader` (call context D in the description above). Calling the method `go` on a local replica results in the unexpected case of the method reader (called from `go`) producing no response because its call context (D) didn't reply while the method `writer` (call context C) returns 666 (instead of 42 suggested by the code of `writer`) because the continuation after the await point in the method `reader` was executed in the call context of `writer` (C) and returned 666. The debug output produced by a local replica for the above canister code reads:\r\n```\r\n[Canister rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai] writer\r\n[Canister rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai] reader\r\n[Canister

change removes the \"timers\" feature from `ic-cdk` package and moves the code into a separate library, `ic-cdk-timers`.\r\n\r\nThere are a few benefits of this approach:\r\n\r\n  1. The code becomes a little cleaner and easier to maintain because there are no conditional compilation going on.\r\n\r\n  2. The clients can now mix canisters using the timers implementation with canisters that implement their own timers in the same workspace. This was not possible with the feature approach.\r\n\r\nPlease include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed.
