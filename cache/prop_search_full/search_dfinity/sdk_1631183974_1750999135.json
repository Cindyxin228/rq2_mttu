This step was needed so that the conversion rate would be initialized when it would be otherwise not initialized (and therefore no way to mint cycles). Now with cycles ledger, the conversion rate is initialized to 1000000 [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/ce63b3d75fbd5912404468499ba85dd0e794acad/rs/nns/cmc/src/lib.rs#L27).
