follows on from the `BufferedStableWriter` introduced in #245 by adding an equivalent `BufferedStableReader`.\r\nThe current `StableReader` reads the entire stable memory into a Vec on the heap, if we just want to deserialize stable memory then this is very wasteful as it allocates lots of memory which is only used temporarily, but then must be paid for from then on by the canister.\r\nThe new `BufferedStableReader` allocates a buffer and then reads from stable memory into that buffer, deserialization can happen incrementally each time the buffer is filled.\r\nThis involves more reads from stable memory but allocates less memory, allocating memory is far slower than reading so the end result is that this new version is significantly faster as well as being cheaper for the canister.\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThere are unit tests and this has been tested on both OpenChat and OpenStorage where it is now running in production. \r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n-

default features from `ic-cdk` and `ic-cdk-macros` which in turn enable the `cdk` feature in `candid`.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe default features are tricky because they end up getting enabled in situations where you don't want them to, e.g. if you have a dependency which in turn depends on candid but without enabling this feature, then you end up with code that doesn't compile (because there are two crates pulling the same one, once with the feature on and once without). This results in not being able to use `ic-cdk` and `ic-cdk-macros` with e.g. parts of the `ic` repository which makes certain things, that should be easy quite, hard to implement in your canister. \r\n\r\nEven worse, if you try to disable default features when importing `ic-cdk` and `ic-cdk-macros`, you actually still end up enabling the default features because `ic-cdk-macros` depends on `ic-cdk` with default features on. So, even if you are trying to be extra careful and disable default features everywhere in your dependencies, you are still stuck with them.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to remove the default features from `ic-cdk` and `ic-cdk-macros`. This results in having to add `candid` as an explicit dependency in your projects (see some of the examples which are fixed in this patch) but this doesn't seem to be a big burden given the headaches that one saves.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/190/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/189", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/189/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/189/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/issues/189/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/189", "id": 1112418750, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD8DZi84xe99l", "number": 189, "title": "refactor: deprecate block_on in favour of the new spawn function", "user": {"login": "roman-kashitsyn", "id": 847968, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0Nzk2OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/847968?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn", "html_url": "https://github.com/roman-kashitsyn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roman-kashitsyn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-01-24T10:02:11Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-24T11:07:07Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-24T11:07:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dfinity/cdk-rs/pulls/189", "html_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/189", "diff_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/189.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/189.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-24T11:07:06Z"}, "body": "This PR provides the functionality of `block_on` under a better name,\r\n`spawn`.
