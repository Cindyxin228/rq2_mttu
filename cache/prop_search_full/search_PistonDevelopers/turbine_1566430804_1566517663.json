My goal for this implementation was to leave as much of the original API the same as possible, which I've achieved for the most part aside from some quirks. \r\n\r\n~~In terms of dependencies, there are more crates introduced in this PR than I wanted (`serde_json` and `spirv-reflect`). The reason for that is, Rendy's exposure of SPIR-V reflection is minimal, leading to having to perform the reflection manually. I will probably open an issue on their repo addressing this. (amethyst/rendy#188)~~\r\n\r\nSince Rendy/gfx-hal uses Winit, I used Piston's winit_window package but modified to be updated and work nicely with the `WindowSettings` builder. I will submit a PR on that repo so the dependency is an actual crate. (PistonDevelopers/winit_window#12)\r\n\r\nQuirks:\r\n- `Scene` manages the window by passing in `WindowSettings`\r\n- The `UBOS_PER_FRAME_SIZE` constant determines how many draw calls (like `DrawTriangles`) there can be between frames. It's `4` for debugging but can be increased to something much larger.\r\n- There's a certain structure the shaders must follow because of SPIR-V. Just keep in mind: \r\n    - Attributes layout locations are exact \r\n    - UBO at set 0 binding 0 contains all the uniforms (which should be matched if needed in both vert and frag stages)\r\n    - Sampler2d is always at set 1 binding 0 \r\n    - Inputs and outputs should have explicit locations\r\n- Toggling SRGB and Blending are disabled for now.\r\n- Drawing with multiple shaders is not tested but theoretically working.\r\n\r\nExamples can be run at scene3d root as such `cargo run --example colored_cube --features vulkan`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PistonDevelopers/turbine/issues/89/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PistonDevelopers/turbine/issues/89/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
