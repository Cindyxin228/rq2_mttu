modified from a method-centric to a block-centric approach.\r\nThis change requires users to optionally specify the block hash for which to make storage queries.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables subxt in the future to make a seamless transition to the `chainHead` #766 methods.\r\nFor better ergonomics, the storage client can be constructed from the main API client, as well as from the blocks API.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n// Fetch the storage (method-centric approach)\r\napi.storage().at(None).await?.fetch(&address).await?;\r\n\r\n// Block-centric approach\r\nlet mut sub = api.blocks().subscribe_finalized().await?;\r\nwhile let Some(block) = sub.next().await {\r\n   let block = block?;\r\n   // The storage API will use the current block hash.\r\n   block.storage().fetch(&address).await?;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, transitioning to the RPC SpecV2 will be seamless: the method-centric approach constructed with `.at()` method will make RPC calls to the `archive` methods, while the block-centric approach will call directly into the `chainHead` class of methods.\r\n\r\nWhile at it, this PR adds the runtime API call RPC method that will be extended to mirror this storage API.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/issues/732.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/774/reactions",
