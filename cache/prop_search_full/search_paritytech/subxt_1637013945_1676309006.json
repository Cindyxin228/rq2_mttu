modified from a method-centric to a block-centric approach.\r\nThis change requires users to optionally specify the block hash for which to make storage queries.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables subxt in the future to make a seamless transition to the `chainHead` #766 methods.\r\nFor better ergonomics, the storage client can be constructed from the main API client, as well as from the blocks API.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n// Fetch the storage (method-centric approach)\r\napi.storage().at(None).await?.fetch(&address).await?;\r\n\r\n// Block-centric approach\r\nlet mut sub = api.blocks().subscribe_finalized().await?;\r\nwhile let Some(block) = sub.next().await {\r\n   let block = block?;\r\n   // The storage API will use the current block hash.\r\n   block.storage().fetch(&address).await?;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, transitioning to the RPC SpecV2 will be seamless: the method-centric approach constructed with `.at()` method will make RPC calls to the `archive` methods, while the block-centric approach will call directly into the `chainHead` class of methods.\r\n\r\nWhile at it, this PR adds the runtime API call RPC method that will be

`sp_core` and `sp_runtime` dependencies optional (opted-in by default). The reasons for doing this are:\r\n\r\n- Supporting compile-to-WASM is simpler without these dependencies (currently they have introduced a hard dependency on wasmtime (under the \"std\" feature) which cannot be compiled to WASM, but disabling the \"std\" feature hits a bunch of assumptions about no_std which breaks other things.\r\n- A smaller dependency graph: for the most part we only rely on certain types from these packages to describe the shape of some responses and such, so taking these types into Subxt allows us to not pull in a load of other stuff that we don't need. \r\n- Reducing the need to keep up to date with Substrate packlage versions: in the past, Substrate dependencies like parity-util-mem have prevented Subxt from being used in conjunction with Substrate packages unless the two used the same versions. We aren't there yet, but I'd like to get to the point where Subxt will happily co-exist with a wide range of Substrate versions, as long as the actual types sent back and forth via the RPC APIs remain compatible.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, the signer stuff still lives in Substrate and so we still depend on sp_core and sp_runtime to provide a `PairSigner` which allows transactions to be signed (which won't be available for now in the WASM builds as a result).  This isn't ideal, but porting that logic over seemed more involved offhand and so I opted to avoid it in this first pass. Providing a simple set of signing primitives feels like a good next step though, and would allow us to completely shed our dependencies on sp_core and sp_runtime (and everything that they bring in).",

That way, any missing or invalid fields (like a missing title) will be caught and get a proper error message.</p>\n<p>I'm not marking this as a breaking change because the expected schema hasn't changed, now it's just enforcing it. Apologies if this does break anyones templates, but that's a good thing as it'd be pointing out something invalid about it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/e27dddc79c92bc6e4562f268fffa5ed752639abd\"><code>e27dddc</code></a> Automatic compilation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/4cc79e46650462b59761133ac18126b98c5e8a60\"><code>4cc79e4</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/issues/146\">#146</a> from JasonEtco/add-schema-fields</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/f883bb4c96333b9f1648f6cfedd554c79ba2d0f5\"><code>f883bb4</code></a> Fix test snapshot</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/3e072056cfbd3dd926a37efe088488e48725c520\"><code>3e07205</code></a> Add more fields to schema</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/e0198cc1f7e8133626ae5dcfb3c6bad7261836c2\"><code>e0198cc</code></a> Updoot some actions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/8d4214150da0f663fa362069aa2bde60f3615916\"><code>8d42141</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/issues/144\">#144</a> from JasonEtco/zod</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/5218616b31098d11715831bdf785c2efade8c1ff\"><code>5218616</code></a> Unrelated prettier-ing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/a3271ceaa5b004fb5d0d1e2c8cabe43735d49bdc\"><code>a3271ce</code></a> Tiny TS tweak</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/219d2eae2060d34a07c563c6eb9c72cfe278caa0\"><code>219d2ea</code></a> Format errors better, add a test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/commit/b5872eabf46e7c1df4c14514d85f559aac49aa2b\"><code>b5872ea</code></a> Implement</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/compare/3a8ba796516b57db8cb2ee6dfc65bc76cd39d56d...e27dddc79c92bc6e4562f268fffa5ed752639abd\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=JasonEtco/create-an-issue&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=2.8.2&new-version=2.9.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

dynamic and static nested query showing a multisig thing.\r\n- `.into_value()` on a dynamic TX to turn it into a `Value` that we can pass into other calls.\r\n- Allow dynamix tx args to be named or unnamed for better readability.\r\n\r\nThis does bring to light, again, a problem with constructing nested calls in static code; the outer call will have a dynamic pallet/call index according to the node we're sending it to, but the inner call won't, and so the code won't be portable across different chains. The dynamic stuff acts as a workaround for this at the mo, but would be good to address it in static code so I'll raise an issue.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored by @lexnv.", "reactions": {"url":

`Extrinsic` type from config (We just treat every extrinsic as a collection of bytes at the moment, and if/when we want to decode them properly we can treat them like events and ask for a type/shape at decode time).\r\n- Tie tx submission in to this; both extrinsics in blocks and tx submission have associated events.\r\n- Add an example subscribing to finalized blocks and printing some details of them.\r\n- Make `api.blocks().subscribe_*()` the only way to subscribe to streams of things (removing similar functionality from Events to avoid lots of repetition and simplify the API surface).\r\n- Remove the `FilterEvents` stuff; it makes much more sense to ask for events via this new blocks API (either for the entire block or for specific extrinsics), and it was all rather complicated.

appears as a type parameter e.g. `Option<Compact<u128>>` as it does in the contracts dispatchables e.g. https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/4b7911607b48a5ca7ebf1d655f12d91cdd241866/frame/contracts/src/lib.rs#L498, then this will incorrectly result in a `Option<u128>` type being generated by `subxt-codegen`.\r\n\r\nThis is because the current codegen assumes that the compact value will be the type of the field directly and can generate the following:\r\n\r\n`struct S { #[codec(compact)] field: u128 }`\r\n\r\nThe `compact` attribute will cause the conversion to be handled during encoding and decoding of the struct. This means that the \"inner\" type (in this case `u128`) can be used directly.\r\n\r\nHowever when the compact type is a type parameter then it is required to use the `codec::Compact<T>` wrapper type directly instead of the field level attribute.\r\n\r\n## Refactoring\r\n\r\nThis PR also incorporates some refactoring of the type path codegen, specifically expanding the `TypePathType` to a strongly typed enum which maps from the `scale_info::TypeDef` but with all the information necessary to generate the hierarchical type paths.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/651/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/651/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/650", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/650/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/650/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/issues/650/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/650", "id": 1369140874, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC_VcNc4-vlMg", "number": 650, "title": "Update criterion requirement from 0.3 to 0.4", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-09-12T01:20:54Z", "updated_at": "2022-09-12T10:16:57Z", "closed_at": "2022-09-12T10:16:56Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paritytech/subxt/pulls/650", "html_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/650", "diff_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/650.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/650.patch", "merged_at": "2022-09-12T10:16:56Z"}, "body": "Updates the requirements on [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">criterion's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[0.4.0] -
