the parachain template we use the [fully verifying import queue\r\n](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/3d9eddbeb262277c79f2b93b9efb5af95a3a35a8/cumulus/client/consensus/aura/src/equivocation_import_queue.rs#L224-L224) which does extra equivocation checks. \r\n\r\nHowever, when we import a warp synced block with state, we don't set a fork choice, leading to an incomplete block import pipeline and error here: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/3d9eddbeb262277c79f2b93b9efb5af95a3a35a8/substrate/client/service/src/client/client.rs#L488-L488\r\n\r\nThis renders warp sync useless for chains using this import queue.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nThe fix is to always import a block with state as best block, as we already do in the normal Aura Verifier.\r\nIn a follow up we should also take another look into unifying the usage of the different import queues.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/paritytech/project-mythical/issues/256", "reactions": {"url":

migrates `pallet-mixnet` to use the umbrella crate. \r\n* Note that some imports like `use sp_application_crypto::RuntimeAppPublic;` and imports from `sp_mixnet::types::` have not been migrated to the umbrella crate as they are not used in any / many other places and are relevant only to the `pallet-mixnet`.\r\n* Transaction related helpers to submit transactions from `frame-system` have been added to the main `prelude` as they have usage across various pallets.\r\n```Rust\r\n\tpub use frame_system::offchain::*;\r\n```\r\n* Exporting `arithmetic` module in the main `prelude` since this is used a lot throughout various pallets.\r\n* Nightly formatting has been applied using `cargo fmt`\r\n* Benchmarking dependencies have been removed from`palet-mixnet` as there is no benchmarking.rs present for `pallet-mixnet`. For the same reason, `\"pallet-mixnet?/runtime-benchmarks\"` has been removed from `umbrella/Cargo.toml`.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Therefore it will end running approval-distribution aggression on block 4, because that is the oldest block it received from approval-voting for which it did not see a BlockFinalized signal.\r\n\r\n",

after a cross-chain transfer via the usage of the `AliasOrigin` instruction. The receiving chain needs to be configured to allow such this instruction to have its intended effect and not just throw an error.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add the alias rules specified in the [RFC for origin preservation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0122-alias-origin-on-asset-transfers.md) to westend chains so we can test these scenarios in the testnet.\r\n\r\nThe new scenarios include:\r\n- Sending a cross-chain transfer from one system chain to another and doing a Transact on the same message (1 hop)\r\n- Sending a reserve asset transfer from one chain to another going through asset hub and doing Transact on the same message (2 hops)\r\n\r\nThe updated chains are:\r\n- Relay: added `AliasChildLocation`\r\n- Collectives: added `AliasChildLocation` and `AliasOriginRootUsingFilter<AssetHubLocation, Everything>`\r\n- People: added `AliasChildLocation` and `AliasOriginRootUsingFilter<AssetHubLocation, Everything>`\r\n- Coretime: added `AliasChildLocation` and `AliasOriginRootUsingFilter<AssetHubLocation, Everything>`\r\n\r\nAssetHub already has `AliasChildLocation` and doesn't need the other config item.\r\nBridgeHub is not intended to be used by end users so I didn't add any config item.\r\nOnly added `AliasChildOrigin` to the relay since we intend for it to be used less.", "reactions": {"url":
