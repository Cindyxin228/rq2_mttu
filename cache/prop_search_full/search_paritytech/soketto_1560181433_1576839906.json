API. To do so the following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n1. `data::Data` hides its internal `BytesMut` and is usable only via its `AsRef`/`AsMut` impls.\r\n2. `data::Outgoing` has been removed. Instead of a single `Sender::send` method we support multiple, e.g. `send_text`, `send_ping` etc., each being generic over its parameter type (e.g. `impl AsRef<[u8]>`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, to allow buffer-reuse when running a sequence of extensions, a `Storage` type has been added which allows upgrading from a shared read-only byte slice to an owned buffer. This \r\nowned buffer is the only place where `BytesMut` is still part of the public API, albeit only relevant for extension writers.\r\n\r\nThe `Storage` type also helps with the conflict between the desire to directly send `&str`/`&[u8]` and the need to mutate the data (e.g. when masking it). I.e. `Sender::send_text` and `Sender::send_binary` (which accept immutable slices) need to mask a copy of the argument slice. Where this is too expensive, applications can use `Sender::send_binary_mut` which masks the data in-place.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- The `validate_utf8` setting has been removed. As `Data` only offers a byte slice view, applications need to perform the check anyway.\r\n- A flag `has_extensions` has been added as an optimisation. If false, `Sender` and `Receiver` never have to compete for the lock only to find the collection to be empty.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
