Also left password.rs there\r\n- I didn't do any renaming and reorganization of parity crypto crate. May be it's worth doing, but I don't have good ideas and would be grateful for any suggestions.\r\n\r\n2. I'm not going to consider substrate code, related to the same crypto primitives.

but the impact on parity-ethereum includes a few points of attention.\r\nI think those should be addressed in a second step but are good to know:\r\n- HashDBRef new trait makes the triedb construction a bit awkward (ptr lifetime), there is certainly a way to make it better.\r\n- memorydb construction through utility function (I put it in journaldb but it is probably not the best place).\r\n- https://github.com/paritytech/trie/pull/2 makes 'keys' function a requirement of parity-eth only so I added some traits (in journaldb again), it feels like overdoing it a bit.\r\n- triehash crate may
