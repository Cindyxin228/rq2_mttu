Everything generated for operations was housed under individual `operation_name::*` modules in the generated code, *except* the operation trait itself which was named `[OperationName]Operation`. This PR moves the operation trait to `operation_name::Operation`. To recompile old components, the operation implementations need to be changed from `impl OperationNameOperation for Component` to `impl operation_name::Operation for Component`.\r\n- The `.error()` method on outputs now takes a `&str` instead of `impl AsRef<str>` due to becoming a trait methods vs generated code. Any call to .error that passed in a `String` or otherwise will need to be updated to pass a string slice instead (e.g. `outputs.output.error(an_error_string)` needs to be changed to `outputs.output.error(&an_error_string)`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/candlecorp/wick/issues/384/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

This means that downstream components no longer need to adopt the timeouts of their upstreams.\r\n- Made wick's internal representation of configuration serializable (but not deserializable, it should
