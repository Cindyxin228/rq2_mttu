This shouldn't happen, since those sections in high memory are marked `NOLOAD` in our linkerscript meaning these shouldn't be `SHT_PROGBITS` and therefore shouldn't be loaded into memory by the resulting binary.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I've determined that this is a flaw with our current implementation of `objcopy` being too granular and including entire loadable **segments** rather than individual **sections** within those segments. It also means the current implemention doesn't exactly match the behavior of `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` which is really bad. This PR rewrites our implementation to only copy loadable sections into the resulting binary.\r\n\r\nThis appears to now produce identical output to the binutils generated binaries, but I want to test further before this gets merged.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9629dfc-c6a5-4eb0-b4a6-5e9d19adb18f)\r\n\r\nOnce this is verified to work, we should get this out into a
