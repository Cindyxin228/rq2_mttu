continuation of #6179, and follows on from PR #6501. These are broken into separate PRs so that we can discuss each PR `HEAD` separately so that the PRs that can get merged, do so quickly. Otherwise, the further along they get stale the more work they all need in order to keep up to `master` without being hard to find which change introduced a possible broken build.\r\n\r\nThis PR only does a version bump to every crate dependency that does not need any code changes to apply cleanly.\r\n\r\nFollowing this PR will be a new PR, where every commit updates a single crate along with the files that were needed to be changed in order to work again. The crates that will need code changes are:\r\n\r\n- tokio 1.12: -> 1.40\r\n- rustc-hash: 1.1 -> 2.0\r\n- miden-core: 0.3 -> 0.10\r\n- notify: 5.0 -> 6.1\r\n- notify-debouncer-mini: 0.2 -> 0.4\r\n- revm: 2.3 -> 14.0\r\n- syn: 1.0 -> 2.0\r\n- tikv-jemallocator: 0.5 -> 0.6\r\n- toml_edit: 0.21 -> 0.22\r\n\r\nThere should also be a commit to upgrade Rust itself to >= `1.81.0`.\r\n\r\n... and for another day, there's 3 crates that will take a bit of time to get working, and so will go under a different issue #6536:\r\n\r\n- annotate-snippets\r\n- lsp-types\r\n- uint\r\n\r\n##

Garbage collection needed to be called on this otherwise it returns references to types that have been cleared from the other engines during garbage collection. \r\n\r\nIn the future, any other nodes that we decide to cache need to have GC applied to them or we will end up crashing the language server on the first key-pressed event. \r\n\r\nI've also removed the gc_frequency setting and now run GC on each keystroke. Without doing this, the spans stored in the TokenMap and what was returned from the compiler were falling out of sync. This ensures that everything is always up to date and the correct spans are used. closes #5260 \r\n\r\nFinally, I've added a `launch.json` that allows for attaching `lldb` to a live running `forc-lsp` process. This was a pretty cruical step for tracking down this bug so would be nice to have it easily accessible for future debugging sessions. \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant

additional tests for constants. Those test cases are important for the implementation of #6351 which will completely restructure compilation of constants.\r\n\r\nTests for recursive `const` definitions should also be considered before we start implementing `const fn` and `const trait`. In particular, we want to better track and provide precise error messages in case of unintended attempt to recursively define a constant in a complex situation that includes `const fn` and `const trait`.\r\n\r\nRelated to #6534, #6537, #6538, #6539, #6540, #6543, and #6544.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in

It does not fix a previously known, more general issue, described in #5097 where we expect warnings to be emitted also on individual elements of an OR arm, even if the whole arm is reachable. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```Sway\r\nmatch v {\r\n    1 => (),\r\n    2 => (),\r\n    1 | 3 => (), <<<--- Warning should be emitted here that `1` is not reachable.\r\n    2 | 4 => (), <<<--- Warning should be emitted here that `2` is not reachable.\r\n    _ => (),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixing this issue requires more invasive restructuring of the propagation of the collected witness information and will be

significant optimisations in how we handle `TokenMap` updates and file traversals, resulting in substantial performance improvements.\r\n\r\n#### Key Changes:\r\n\r\n1. Selective TokenMap Clearing: Instead of clearing the entire `TokenMap` on each keystroke, we now only clear tokens belonging to the modified file.\r\n2. Targeted Traversal: We've limited the traversal to only the modified file, eliminating unnecessary processing of unchanged dependencies and workspace files.\r\n\r\n#### Performance Impact:\r\nThese optimisations have led to substantial improvements in traverse times, particularly for subsequent traversals:\r\n\r\n| Build Type | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Absolute Improvement (ms) | Relative

couple things:\r\n\r\n* Creates all of the necessary lexical scopes in the collection context namespace\r\n* Introduces the collection context in the type check context\r\n* Updates type checking code to enter the corresponding lexical scope in the collection context\r\n* Introduces a mapping from a span to a lexical scope in the namespace\r\n* Implements collection steps for so far unimplemented AST nodes\r\n\r\nThis prepares the compiler for a future PR where the additional namespace will be able to be removed from the type checking, and with it the cloning we do as we type check.\r\n\r\n##

report an error, but simply adds an error node to the parse tree. This error node is transformed to AST error nodes, and the error goes unhandled until IR generation. However, during IR generation the constant evaluator assumes that no error nodes exist, which causes a panic in the compiler.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the constant evaluator so that it now fails nicely when encountering an error node. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to fix the problem in the parser instead, but I can't find an easy way to do it that still allows for error recovery.\r\n\r\n##

Those checks were:\r\n  - redundant. The same checks were also done at the IR side.\r\n  - incomplete. The checks were covering only the function and method calls, not other kinds of storage access (e.g., intrinsics).\r\n  - inaccurate. The checks were relying on `#[storage]` attributes, which do not necessary represent actual storage access patterns.\r\n- extends `MetadataManager` to be able to store more then one `Span` per `MetadataIndex`. E.g., for a function, we can now store the span of the whole function declaration, but in addition, also the span pointing only to the function name.\r\n- removes two different and overlapping storage access mismatch errors and introduces one expressive diagnostics that points to the exact storage access violations inside of a function (see demo below).\r\n\r\nNote that having the purity tests at the IR level means that no purity errors will be reported on non-used functions. This was already the case before, since the complete set of tests was done at the IR level, and only two tests (inaccurately) at the type-checking phase, where errors would be reported even for the non-used functions. The purity guaranty is given for all the compiled code.\r\n\r\nCloses #6320.\r\nCloses #6431.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nBefore, we had two different error messages, rendered potentially several times per access violation. \r\n\r\n![Before 01 - Storage attribute access mismatch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1207b640-2742-4cee-afa9-da9cfc743e2c)\r\n\r\n![Before 02 - Function performs storage read](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/284f9a65-fc6c-4318-ab83-5beab730b4d3)\r\n\r\nNow, we have only one error message that points to the access violations and explains them.\r\n\r\n![After 01 - Pure function cannot access storage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87f69493-efd2-4230-bd52-95f0ea1c6fd8)\r\n\r\n![After 02 - Pure function cannot access

that we use the first element of the array as its element type. This can be problematic as the first element is not \"concrete\". For example, when it is `Numeric`.\r\n\r\nNow we iterate the array elements, search for the first \"good\" element, and use its type as the array type. This means:\r\n1 - if the type is concrete, we use it;\r\n2 - if the type is `Numeric`, we keep searching for something better;\r\n\r\nThis allows consistent arrays, but where the concrete types are at the end.\r\n\r\n```sway\r\nlet a = [1, 2u8]; <- we will choose u8\r\nlet a = [None, Some(1), Some(2u8)]; <- we will choose Option<u8>, instead of Option<T>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## snapshot tests\r\n\r\nThis PR also brings an experiment. Now when an \"e2e\"  test has a file `snapshot.toml` it will run as `cargo insta` snapshot tests. These tests can be run as normal: `cargo r -p test`, and in two new ways:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> cargo t -p test\r\n> cargo insta test\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnapshots can be reviewed using normal \"cargo insta\" workflow.\r\n\r\nThe secret lies in https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/libtest-mimic. **I also want to suggest that all our tests migrate to this model**, where we could just use \"cargo test\" normally. Apart from that, I opted to use the `forc` executable, which means tests will run in parallel. In the future, if we want to poke compiler internals, we can expose them using flags, or create a special binary to fit our needs.\r\n\r\n`snapshot.toml` is still empty because I have no idea to what put there at the moment. My initial idea was to configure what ends up into snapshots (multiple runs, compiler flags, script/contract calls) etc...

while handling `impl self` nodes with multiple blocks.\r\n\r\nSee the following example for a simple example of the problem:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct A {}\r\n\r\nimpl A {   //dependency of this impl is overwritten by the next impl\r\n    fn a() {}\r\n    fn b() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl A {   //this will overwrite the dependency for the previous impl\r\n    fn ab() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes the problem by introducing a `,` while joining the names for the key.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/6319.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant
