Improved metrics gathering.\r\n- Stabilization and better test coverage of the `fuel-vm`. We removed almost all unsafe code and added test cases for each opcode. Fixed some edge cases with memory in the `fuel-vm`.\r\n- Fully integrated Merkle trees and filled all malleable fields in the transactions.\r\n- Added retryable messages, removed redundant fields from it, and updated the API to support a new commitment schema.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Breaking\r\n\r\n- All unsafe functions were replaced with safe analog in the `fuel-crypto` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/346\r\n- `$hp` holds the address of the last available byte in a heap, while previously it was `$hp - 1` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/377\r\n- Each variant in the `fuel_tx::Input` enum now has its own type - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/364\r\n- Message nonce is unified and now `Bytes32` everywhere - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/394\r\n- Removed the `message_id` field from all places - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/397, https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/373, \r\n- Unified the block height in all places with the introduction of a new `BlockHeigh` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/410\r\n- Make SMO instruction take data ptr as an argument -  https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/404\r\n- Now the chain id affects the signature and predicate's owner and should be passed into the `sign` function - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/406\r\n- Updated the `produce_blocks` endpoint to accept the start time and the number of blocks. All new blocks will use the previous timestamp as a base - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1059\r\n- The `fuel-core` stores only unspent coins and messages, so all API that previously returned spent coins is affected - Prune owned coin idx when inputs are spent by @Voxelot in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1055\r\n- The message proof API has been changed to be compatible with a new version - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1071\r\n- The `fuel-core` now has retryable messages and coin messages. Retryable messages can only be consumed during successful transaction execution. The coin message acts as common coins. `resouces_to_spend` API was replaced with `coins_to_spend` that returns a new `CoinType` type. - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1067\r\n\r\n## All

most of the changes from the https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1157 but for the `master` branch.\r\nIt adds two e2e tests, but they fail because of new changes in the `fuel-vm`(the change to the `PC` register). It is not critical, but replacing them with the correct scripts later would be nice.\r\n- One test uploads the contract with a huge large state and executes it. The test takes a lot of time to execute and highlights that we have performance problems with the state calculation: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1143\r\n- Another test is more of a base for spamming the testnets. We can put any hex-encoded transaction and dry run it on the network. It contains a simple transfer transaction right now.\r\n\r\nThe change improves the `fuel-core snapshot` command to accept the arguments, and you can either snap the whole state of the blockchain via the `everyone` command, or the state only of the contract. In the follow-up PRs we can snapping of the coins and messages too.\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n- Use a lru cache to store the uncompressed data in the DB. The size is configurable via CLI `max-database-cache-size`.\r\n- Added a `DryRun` execution type that skips the coinbase `Mint` transaction. In the future, we can skip some non-actual steps too.\r\n- Updated the `PrometheusExtension` to not use the lock.\r\n- Removed usage of the tracing extension in the graph QL because we have `PrometheusExtension` to gather the statistic about requests. https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1152 removes the honeycomb, so I didn't duplicate it here.\r\n- Replaced the `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + `Semaphore` by `tokio_rayon::spawn_fifo`.\r\n- Replaced the concatenated `column_key` with the array for separate hash maps per column in the `MemoryStore` and `MemoryTransactionView`.\r\n- Replaced the `Vec<u8>` in the KV API by the `Arc<Vec<u8>>`, because in most cases, we use it only for deserialization, and the memory database can continue to store the type. It helps reduce the number of clones.\r\n- Used `BTreeMap` in the `MemoryStore`, because it allows to have a more optimized `iter_all` method. Without this change, a new e2e test fails with a timeout.\r\n- Dry run doesn't wait for relayer anymore.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1158/reactions",

block stuff.\r\n- Used `Nonce` as a primary key for messages instead of `MessageId`. Because of it, we don't need `CheckedMessage` anymore. Also, several tests failed because the nonce was the same.\r\n- Updated the `Nonce` from `u64` to 32 bytes. Updated the ABI to use `uint256` instead of `uint64` - https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-v2-contracts/pull/35\r\n- Renamed `Resources` into `Coins`. Renamed all comments and GraphQL API. Moved `coin.rs` and `resource.rs` into one `coins.rs`.\r\n- Fixed some tests for https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/377 not to increase the `HP`.\r\n- Removed usage of the `Output::Message`.\r\n- Renamed `message_output_count` - > `message_receipt_count` and `message_output_root` -> `message_receipt_root`\r\n\r\nAnd the main feature of why this change was created(implemented by several lines): \r\n`MessageData` aren't marked as spent unless included in a successfully executed script tx", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1067/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1067/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1063", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1063/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1063/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1063/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1063", "id": 1624759305, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEVaE485MENXz", "number": 1063, "title": "fix yaml and add linting job", "user": {"login": "Voxelot", "id": 794823, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDgyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794823?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot", "html_url": "https://github.com/Voxelot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-03-15T05:09:29Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-15T05:53:19Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-15T05:53:18Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pulls/1063", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1063", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1063.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1063.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-15T05:53:18Z"}, "body": "A recent PR broke the yaml indentation for the helm chart.

out our inner `peer_manager` logic from `PeerInfoBehaviour` to top of the p2p service, so that behaviour is not tasked with handling logic and decisions about peers, it just reports about peer events.\r\n\r\nSo I renamed previously named `PeerManagerBehaviour` to `PeerReportBehaviour`\r\nand left `PeerManager` struct inside `peer_manager.rs` consequently this messes up the **diffs be warned**.\r\n\r\nAlthough moving `peer_manager` up the stack cleaned up a lot of code and was a good decision, someone still had to poll `decay` and `health_check` intervals to inform p2p_service/peer_manager to perform the mentioned tasks, I had left those events inside `PeerReportBehaviour` as for now at least, until maybe we refactor some other parts and make it clearer

information via type objects rather than directly through the database, which will allow a clean removal of the graphql crate, where the traits will move to, while the implementations for `Database` remain within `fuel-core`.\r\n\r\nThere are some small pointer annoyances such as `borrowed_box`, but this is unavoidable because `Database` is passed into the graphql context as a `Box`, and so whenever its accessed the pointer to it by default is `&Box<T>`, and so any function which requires erasing `Box<DatabasePort>` (which is aliased to `Database` with the graphql crate) to something like `Box<dyn MessageProofData>` will inevitable create a borrowed box and so clippy will complain, but this can't really be avoided due to the graphql structure", "reactions": {"url":

Closes https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/627\r\n\r\nThis PR calculates SMT roots for a contract's state and balances. Both states and balances are modified via random-access inserts and deletes, so roots must be calculated as an SMT on top of a sparse key-value dataset. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR modifies the root calculations and related tests to use the correct empty root, the 32 byte 0, rather than the hash of the empty string. The 32 byte 0 is the default for SMTs while the hash of the empty string is the default for BMTs.

the swarm itself instead of our PeerManager:\r\n```rust\r\nif p2p_service.swarm.connected_peers().count() > peer_limit { panic!() }\r\n```\r\nWhile generally this should not return more peers than allowed, one of the reasons we have PeerManager is to actually contain number of peers connected logic, so moving the assertion to\r\n```rust\r\nif p2p_service.peer_manager().total_peers_connected() > peer_limit { panic!() }\r\n```\r\nshould suffice since PeerManager is the one disconnecting surplus peers.\r\n\r\nOther, and bigger, issue with the test was the amount of simulated nodes we used in our example.\r\nHaving 100+ nodes running makes the test itself unnecessarily slow.\r\nThis became even more evident now that we made our Heartbeat protocol ask for a disconnect from a node that did not reply within 2 seconds with a Block Height. So nodes started disconnecting from each other and the test would never hit its exit point.\r\n\r\nActually there is no need to have that amount of nodes, instead same assertion can be achieved with a smaller amount, so I have decreased the amount of nodes in the test.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1002/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
