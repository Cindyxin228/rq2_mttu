contract, a Call receipt is appended. If I'm reading [the spec](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/specs/vm/instruction_set.md#call-call-contract) correctly, in such a case, the call receipt's `to` field should be the called contract's ID, and the `from` field should be `0x0000...`, indicating that it was called from the script.\r\n\r\nWe were putting the contract's ID on both `to` and `from` fields and this PR aims to fix that.\r\n\r\nThe issue was:\r\n- To initiate the call, we modify `REG_FP`.\r\n- When creating the receipt, we check `self.registers[REG_FP] == 0` to see if the call is external.\r\n- This gives an unexpected result because `REG_FP` was modified.\r\n\r\nThe fix is basically reading the value for the `from` field before `REG_FP` gets modified.", "reactions": {"url":

\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nThe expected behavior for a revert is to immediately cease execution of opcodes, and only include one revert receipt.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior:\r\nWhen a contract call reverted, the VM appended two revert receipts.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe root cause is that while `run_call` correctly returned a revert state, this result was then discarded by the parent stack and not propagated. Since revert doesn't increase $pc, the same opcodes would run again on the parent stack (callee) causing the receipt to be appended twice.\r\n\r\nThe fix simply checks the result of `call` and returns with the Revert state if needed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/127/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused":
