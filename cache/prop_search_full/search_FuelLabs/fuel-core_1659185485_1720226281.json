[#2014](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2014): Added a separate thread for the block importer.\r\n- [#2013](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2013): Added a separate thread to process P2P database lookups.\r\n- [#2004](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2004): Added new CLI argument `continue-services-on-error` to control internal flow of services.\r\n- [#2004](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2004): Added handling of incorrect shutdown of the off-chain GraphQL worker by using state rewind feature.\r\n- [#2007](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2007): Improved metrics:\r\n  - Added database metrics per column.\r\n  - Added statistic about commit time of each database.\r\n  - Refactored how metrics are registered: Now, we use only one register shared between all metrics. This global register is used to encode all metrics.\r\n- [#1996](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1996): Added support for rollback command when state rewind feature is enabled. The command allows the rollback of the state of the blockchain several blocks behind until the end of the historical window. The default historical window it 7 days.\r\n- [#1996](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1996): Added support for the state rewind feature. The feature allows the execution of the blocks in the past and the same execution results to be received. Together with forkless upgrades, execution of any block from the past is possible if historical data exist for the target block height.\r\n- [#1994](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1994): Added the actual implementation for the `AtomicView::latest_view`.\r\n- [#1972](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1972): Implement `AlgorithmUpdater` for `GasPriceService`\r\n- [#1948](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1948): Add new `AlgorithmV1` and `AlgorithmUpdaterV1` for the gas price. Include tools for analysis\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): Added new CLI arguments:\r\n    - `graphql-max-depth`\r\n    - `graphql-max-complexity`\r\n    - `graphql-max-recursive-depth`\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- [#2015](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2015): Small fixes for the database:\r\n  - Fixed the name for historical columns - Metrics was working incorrectly for historical columns.\r\n  - Added recommended setting for the RocksDB - The source of recommendation is official documentation https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Setup-Options-and-Basic-Tuning#other-general-options.\r\n  - Removed repairing since it could corrupt the database if fails - Several users reported about the corrupted state of the database after having a \"Too many descriptors\" error where in logs, repairing of the database also failed with this error creating a `lost` folder.\r\n- [#2010](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2010): Updated the block importer to allow more blocks to be in the queue. It improves synchronization speed and mitigate the impact of other services on synchronization speed.\r\n- [#2006](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2006): Process block importer events first under P2P pressure.\r\n- [#2002](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2002): Adapted the block producer to react to checked transactions that were using another version of consensus parameters during validation in the TxPool. After an upgrade of the consensus parameters of the network, TxPool could store invalid `Checked` transactions. This change fixes that by tracking the version that was used to validate the transactions.\r\n- [#1999](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1999): Minimize the number of panics in the codebase.\r\n- [#1990](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1990): Use latest view for mutate GraphQL queries after modification of the node.\r\n- [#1992](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1992): Parse multiple relayer contracts, `RELAYER-V2-LISTENING-CONTRACTS` env variable using a `,` delimiter.\r\n- [#1980](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1980): Add `Transaction` to relayer 's event filter\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n- [#2012](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2012): Bumped the `fuel-vm` to `0.55.0` release. More about the change [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.55.0).\r\n- [#2001](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2001): Prevent GraphQL query body to be huge and cause OOM. The default body size is `1MB`. The limit can be changed by the `graphql-request-body-bytes-limit` CLI argument.\r\n- [#1991](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1991): Prepare the database to use different types than `Database` for atomic view.\r\n- [#1989](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1989): Extract `HistoricalView` trait from the `AtomicView`.\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): New `fuel-core-client` is incompatible with the old `fuel-core` because of two requested new fields.\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): Changed default value for `api-request-timeout` to be `30s`.\r\n- [#1676](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1676): Now, GraphQL API has complexity and depth limitations on the queries. The default complexity limit is `20000`. It is ~50 blocks per request with transaction IDs and ~2-5 full blocks.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- [#2000](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2000): Use correct query name in metrics for aliased queries.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Generate and publish code coverage reports in the CI by @Dentosal in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1947\r\n* Gas Price Algorithm by @MitchTurner in

Overview\r\n\r\nAdded support for the state rewind feature. The feature allows the execution of the blocks in the past and the same execution results to be received. Together with forkless upgrades, execution of any block from the past is possible if historical data exist for the target block height. The default size of historical/rewind window is 7 days. \r\n\r\nAlso added support for rollback command when state rewind feature is enabled. The command allows the rollback of the state of the blockchain several blocks behind until the end of the historical window.\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\nThe change adds a new `HistoricalRocksDB` type that is the wrapper around regular `RocksDB`. This type has inside another RocksDB instance that is used to duplicate all tables plus has one more column to store the reverse modifications at each block height. The reverse modification is the opposite to the operation that was done during transition from block height X to X + 1. The screenshot below should describe the idea:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"723\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/assets/18346821/c4becce0-1669-4938-8dd7-87d274efa224\">\r\n\r\nThe key of duplicated tables is extended with block height, and the value is the reverse operation to reach the state of entry at the previous height. Having the history of reverse operations, we can iterate back from the latest version of the entry to the previous one.\r\n\r\nUsing the main property of the RocksDB(sorting keys by default), lookup operations are fast and we don't need to iterate all modifications. It is just enough to find the nearest reverse operation to the target height.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in tests\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the code myself\r\n- [x] I have created follow-up issues caused by this PR and linked them here\r\n  -

It is only preparation for corresponding features without actual implementation.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we cloned the `Database` type and used it as a view without any atomic properties. In a new implementation, `Database` is only a view provider now, but the view itself implements all read functionality.\r\n\r\nWe have two views. Separation for `IterableView` and `KeyValueView` is needed because we can't iterate over the historical storage. We only have access by key to the values. It would be nice to only have one view that supports all functionality, but we don't need iteration functionality for the historical view(at least for now), and it is expensive to support(requires more storage or enormous computation resources).\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\n`Database`, `IterableView` and `KeyValueView` all are aliases to the `GenericDatabase`. The `GenericDatabase` implements all storage traits from the `fuel-storage` crate, deriving implementation from `StructuredStorage`. We need it reuse the storage trait implementation for all three types. They only require the inner storage to implement `KeyValueInspect` to derive implementation. \r\n\r\n`KeyValueViewWrapper` and `IterableViewWrapper` are wrappers around `Arc<dyn Trait>` that implement `KeyValueInspect` traits.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1955\r\n\r\nThe updater has two ports it owns:\r\n- `L2BlockSource`\r\n- `MetadataStorage`\r\n\r\n`L2BlockSource` is for getting the latest block as they are committed and using that to update the gas price algorithm.\r\n`MetadataStorage` is for maintaining the state of the updater in the case the service shuts down or needs to be restarted. For now it just naively stores the `AlgorithmUpdaterV1`, and just the most recent version. I don't know if we need to consider storing older versions of it for the scenario we need to roll back the chain.\r\n\r\nI started adding the DA Record stuff, but we're not using it so we can YAGNI it for now, otherwise it would just be implementing a bunch of adapters that don't do anything.\r\n\r\nThis implements the service without any live adapters for the ports.\r\n\r\nWill follow this up with another PR that actually implements the ports.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in

with `u32::from_str` in parameter of type `SortedTXCursor` which was preventing from making chained API calls.\r\nThis PR, fixes this by decoding `BlockHeight` from hexadecimal form in `SortedTXCursor`.\r\n\r\nThis bug wasn't catch by the test `tx::get_transactions()` because the test was using only txs included in block 3 that has a string representation that is the same in an hexadecimal and decimal encoding. I added the creation of 10 blocks at start of the test so that now the txs are included in blocks that have a hexadecimal and decimal encoding form that differs.\r\n\r\nI didn't spotted any hangs on the endpoint when the cursor is initialized manually, however as we can't ask to start at a precise block height without specifying a previous `tx_id` it's not very usable to make manual search.\r\n\r\nPS: This is my first contribution and so to what I saw my PR doesn't brake anything else and I tried to follow the guidelines of the repository, however maybe their things that I missed

crashes.\r\n\r\nThe synchronization speed improvement is done by:\r\n- Making all requests asynchronous. Before, the first request to fetch the blocked header was synchronous and required awaiting it because of `and_then`.\r\n- The process of block fetching is separated from block execution. Before, we fetched X blocks and waited for their execution before requesting new X blocks. The fetching is a new parallel task that uses the `batch_sender` variable for backpressure. The task fetches blocks in parallel and sends them into a channel with buffer `1`. The executor's task is to receive the batch from the channel and execute it, allowing the request for a new batch to be made in parallel.\r\n\r\nIf the execution speed is faster than fetching, we request more than one batch in parallel, up to the buffer limit. Tests shows that.\r\n\r\nThe change also handles cases better when a P2P request fails without a known `PeerId`.\r\n\r\nWithout change, I was syncing 2M blocks for 4 hours. With this change, it takes me 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in tests\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the code myself\r\n",

It also fixes the issue of not reconnecting to the reserved nodes when the reserved node is restarted and got new IP.\r\n\r\n- The change moves the reconnection handling into the `PeerReport` behavior. It removes ping-ponging reserved peers between the primary behavior and the `PeerReport` behavior and encapsulates the logic inside the `PeerReport`. Also, it eliminates the timer and replaces it with the queue of reconnections, reducing noise in logs(before, we had much more trash errors).\r\n- Added logs for cases when the dial fails. They are very helpful to debug issues with connection.\r\n- Simplified initialization of the `ConnectionTracker` and `FuelAuthenticated`. It allows the reuse of libp2p built-in connections builder.\r\n- Removed the usage of the Mplex since it doesn't have a backpressure mechanism. Now we use Yamux by default. It is breaking the change since nodes with the old codebase can't connect to new nodes.\r\n- Propagated `max_concurrent_streams` for request-response protocol.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the code myself", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1915/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1915/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1914", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1914/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1914/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1914/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1914", "id": 2324274042, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEVaE485w783W", "number": 1914, "title": "Fixed halting of the node in rare conditions", "user": {"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-05-29T21:25:09Z", "updated_at": "2024-05-30T07:47:35Z", "closed_at": "2024-05-30T07:47:34Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pulls/1914", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1914", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1914.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1914.patch", "merged_at": "2024-05-30T07:47:34Z"}, "body": "My node halted during synchronization with the dev cluster. According to the logs, the importing of the blocks stopped because someone was still processing the previous block. I've added a 20-second timeout on the block processing to debug this issue more easily in the future.\r\n\r\nDuring my node's graceful shutdown, the `PoA` service was waiting for the child `PoASyncTask` to finish his work. The child process was locked and captured the `ImportResult`, which caused the importer service to be locked. I assume one of `DeadlineClock`'s await functions caused that. I haven't looked into how exactly it could happen; I just replaced the usage of the custom `DeadlineClock` with an `Interval` since it doesn't require `await`. It is just a bad practice to call `await` inside of the `tokio::select`. \r\n\r\nMaybe, we need to remove `DeadlineClock` from the `PoA` service as well later just to minimize `await` in the `tokio::select`.

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1877\r\n\r\nThis PR adds block Merkle data and metadata to the list of migrated tables during regenesis. Creating a snapshot now inlcudes the `FuelBlockMerkleData` and `FuelBlockMerkleMetadata` tables. Loading the snapshot writes the `FuelBlockMerkleData` and `FuelBlockMerkleMetadata` snapshot tables to the `OldFuelBlockMerkleData` and `OldFuelBlockMerkleMetadata`  database tables respectively (2 new tables added to the off-chain database).\r\n\r\nWhen querying for a message proof, we check the block height of the query. If the requested message proof is for block height at or above the regenesis block height, we continue to use the on-chain database for data lookups. If it is instead lower than the regenesis block height, we then check the off-chain database for the `Old` tables.\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactors the block proof logic to rely on a new trait called `DatabaseMerklizedBlocks` which provides an interface for querying block related Merkle data. Specifically, this includes retrieving Merkle block data and metadata, and loading the block Merkle tree. The `DatabaseMessageProof` is now implemented by default for any type that implements this trait, which include the on-chain and off-chain databases that define the corresponding tables.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to not be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n- [x] New behavior is reflected in

[#1868](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1868): Include the `event_inbox_root` in the header hash. Changed types of the `transactions_count` to `u16` and `message_receipt_count` to `u32` instead of `u64`. Updated the application hash root calculation to not pad numbers.\r\n- [#1866](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1866): Fixed a runtime panic that occurred when restarting a node. The panic happens when the relayer database is already populated, and the relayer attempts an empty commit during start up. This invalid commit is removed in this PR.\r\n- [#1871](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1871): Fixed `block` endpoint to return fetch the blocks from both databases after regenesis.\r\n- [#1856](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1856): Replaced instances of `Union` with `Enum` for GraphQL definitions of `ConsensusParametersVersion` and related types. This is needed because `Union` does not support multiple `Version`s inside discriminants or empty variants. \r\n- [#1870](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1870): Fixed benchmarks for the `0.25.3`. \r\n- [#1870](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1870): Improves the performance of getting the size of the contract from the `InMemoryTransaction`.\r\n- [#1851](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1851/): Provided migration capabilities (enabled addition of new column families) to RocksDB instance.\r\n\r\n### Added \r\n\r\n- [#1853](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1853): Added a test case to verify the database's behavior when new columns are added to the RocksDB database.\r\n- [#1860](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1860): Regenesis now preserves `FuelBlockIdsToHeights` off-chain table.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#1847](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1847): Simplify the validation interface to use `Block`. Remove `Validation` variant of `ExecutionKind`.\r\n- [#1832](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1832): Snapshot generation can be cancelled. Progress is also reported.\r\n- [#1837](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1837): Refactor the executor and separate validation from the other use cases\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Weekly `cargo update` by @github-actions in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1850\r\n* Refactor/separate validation from other executions by @MitchTurner in

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1751\r\n\r\n- Separate `Production` from `DryRun` and remove `ExecutionKind` and `ExecutionType`.\r\n- Refactor code down\r\n- Remove `thread_block_transaction` concept because YAGNI\r\n- Remove `PartialBlockComponent` type\r\n- Remove intermediate `inner` functions\r\n- Separate `block_storage_tx` from `BlockExecutor`. This was for a couple of reasons, but the big one is that all the `&mut self`s of the `BlockExecutor` can only be handed out one at a time and that was making the code more complicated. We could have just deconstructed `self`, but then we wouldn't have access to any methods. This was a clean way to separate them, and it makes more sense logically IMO. `ExecutorInstance` still keeps them together, so maybe there is an argument so separate them higher, but this is a good improvement in the mean time.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n- [ ] New behavior is reflected in tests\r\n- [ ] [The

issues:\r\n- Untracked\r\n\r\nWhile testing the feature for sending `Block` versions over GraphQL, we discovered that the current approach to GraphQL type versioning doesn't work as expected. Using `async-graphql::Union` is poorly suited for versioning because:\r\n- union types cannot define multiple variants with the same inner types (e.g., you cannot define a union with  `V1(Version), V2(Version), ...`)\r\n- union types are designed to represent sum types/disjoint union types (e.g., `HeavyOperation` and `LightOperation` where the type must be one or the other)\r\n\r\nThis prevents us from defining a second version. I.e.,\r\n```\r\n#[derive(Union)]\r\npub enum ConsensusParametersVersion {\r\n    V1(Version),\r\n    V2(Version),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill fail to compile, preventing us from releasing new versions.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use `async-graphql::Enum`. `Enum` writes the enum in the SDL as a real enum. This allows us to reuse types within variants or provide empty variants. This is better suited for versioning. This will allow us to define future versions easily: \r\n\r\n```\r\n#[derive(Enum)]\r\npub enum ConsensusParametersVersion {\r\n    V1,\r\n    V2,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change must be used to patch `0.24` and `0.25`. Once these versions are updated:\r\n- We must update the image in the dev cluster\r\n- SDK teams must update their versions to include the fix\r\n- Sway team must be updated to use new `fuels-rs`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Breaking changes are clearly marked as such in the PR description and changelog\r\n- [ ] New behavior is reflected in tests\r\n- [ ] [The

Remove `Validation` variant of `ExecutionKind`. Clean up a bunch of other little details by removing generalizations that existed before for things like tx `source`.\r\n\r\nA lot of these changes are breaking down huge functions and trying to make it a bit more declarative. This will hopefully mitigate the need for hand-holding comments all the way down and you can just read the name of the functions to know what is going on. For example:\r\n```rs\r\n        // Throw a clear error if the transaction id is a duplicate\r\n        if tx_st_transaction\r\n            .storage::<ProcessedTransactions>()\r\n            .contains_key(tx_id)?\r\n        {\r\n            return Err(ExecutorError::TransactionIdCollision(*tx_id))\r\n        }\r\n ```\r\n became\r\n ```\r\n Self::check_tx_is_not_duplicate(tx_id, tx_st_transaction)?;\r\n ```\r\n about 20x better.\r\n \r\n I'm still kinda unsatisfied with the clarity with some spots though. For example, I'm not sure what state is supposed to change in the case of a `revert`, I'm just trusting the order things existed before and the tests. I think it could be better to have a match case for `if reverted { ... } else { ... }` instead of threading the `reverted` bool through to subsequent functions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Breaking

[#1821](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1821): Can handle missing tables in snapshot.\r\n- [#1814](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1814): Bugfix: the `iter_all_by_prefix` was not working for all tables. The change adds a `Rust` level filtering.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#1831](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1831): Included the total gas and fee used by transaction into `TransactionStatus`.\r\n- [#1821](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1821): Propagate shutdown signal to (re)genesis. Also add progress bar for (re)genesis.\r\n- [#1813](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1813): Added back support for `/health` endpoint.\r\n- [#1799](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1799): Snapshot creation is now concurrent.\r\n- [#1811](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1811): Regenesis now preserves old blocks and transactions for GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#1833](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1833): Regenesis of `SpentMessages` and `ProcessedTransactions`.\r\n- [#1830](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1830): Use versioning enum for WASM executor input and output.\r\n- [#1816](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1816): Updated the upgradable executor to fetch the state transition bytecode from the database when the version doesn't match a native one. This change enables the WASM executor in the \"production\" build and requires a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\r\n- [#1812](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1812): Follow-up PR to simplify the logic around parallel snapshot creation.\r\n- [#1809](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1809): Fetch `ConsensusParameters` from the database\r\n- [#1808](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1808): Fetch consensus parameters from the provider.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n- [#1826](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1826): The changes make the state transition bytecode part of the `ChainConfig`. It guarantees the state transition's availability for the network's first blocks.\r\n    The change has many minor improvements in different areas related to the state transition bytecode:\r\n    - The state transition bytecode lies in its own file(`state_transition_bytecode.wasm`) along with the chain config file. The `ChainConfig` loads it automatically when `ChainConfig::load` is called and pushes it back when `ChainConfig::write` is called.\r\n    - The `fuel-core` release bundle also contains the `fuel-core-wasm-executor.wasm` file of the corresponding executor version.\r\n    - The regenesis process now considers the last block produced by the previous network. When we create a (re)genesis block of a new network, it has the `height = last_block_of_old_netowkr + 1`. It continues the old network and doesn't overlap blocks(before, we had `old_block.height == new_genesis_block.hegiht`).\r\n    - Along with the new block height, the regenesis process also increases the state transition bytecode and consensus parameters versions. It guarantees that a new network doesn't use values from the previous network and allows us not to migrate `StateTransitionBytecodeVersions` and `ConsensusParametersVersions` tables.\r\n    - Added a new CLI argument, `native-executor-version,` that allows overriding of the default version of the native executor. It can be useful for side rollups that have their own history of executor upgrades.\r\n    - Replaced:\r\n      \r\n      ```rust\r\n               let file = std::fs::File::open(path)?;\r\n               let mut snapshot: Self = serde_json::from_reader(&file)?;\r\n      ```\r\n      \r\n      with a:\r\n      \r\n      ```rust\r\n               let mut json = String::new();\r\n               std::fs::File::open(&path)\r\n                   .with_context(|| format!(\"Could not open snapshot file: {path:?}\"))?\r\n                   .read_to_string(&mut json)?;\r\n               let mut snapshot: Self = serde_json::from_str(json.as_str())?;\r\n      ```\r\n      because it is 100 times faster for big JSON files.\r\n    - Updated all tests to use `Config::local_node_*` instead of working with the `SnapshotReader` directly. It is the preparation of the tests for the futures bumps of the `Executor::VERSION`. When we increase the version, all tests continue to use `GenesisBlock.state_transition_bytecode = 0` while the version is different, which forces the usage of the WASM executor, while for tests, we still prefer to test native execution. The `Config::local_node_*` handles it and forces the executor to use the native version.\r\n    - Reworked the `build.rs` file of the upgradable executor. The script now caches WASM bytecode to avoid recompilation. Also, fixed the issue with outdated WASM bytecode. The script reacts on any modifications of the `fuel-core-wasm-executor` and forces recompilation (it is why we need the cache), so WASM bytecode always is actual now.\r\n- [#1822](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1822): Removed support of `Create` transaction from debugger since it doesn't have any script to execute.\r\n- [#1822](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1822): Use `fuel-vm 0.49.0` with new transactions types - `Upgrade` and `Upload`. Also added `max_bytecode_subsections` field to the `ConsensusParameters` to limit the number of bytecode subsections in the state transition bytecode. \r\n- [#1816](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1816): Updated the upgradable executor to fetch the state transition bytecode from the database when the version doesn't match a native one. This change enables the WASM executor in the \"production\" build and requires a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\r\n\r\n### Before requesting review\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the code

This is done using the same functions and we have internal conditional logic for each use case. This makes the code more complicated than it needs to be and makes it hard to read.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `Validation` variant from `ExecutionTypes` and creates new methods for just validation. Since there is only a set number of places in our code  that uses this variant, it cleans the code up a lot to just have it be separate method, thus removing the need for all the internal conditional logic for each variant.\r\n\r\nRemaining work to do in subsequent PRs:\r\n- Remove block production code from validation branch (Just use Block everywhere instead of Partial Block and Components, etc)\r\n- Separate `DryRun` from `Production` and remove `ExecutionType`\r\n- Hopefully remove `ExecutionKind` as well.
