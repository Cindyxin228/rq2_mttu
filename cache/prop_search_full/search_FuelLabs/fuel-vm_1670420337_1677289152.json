https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/527\r\n\r\nWhen traversing a Merkle tree (during SMT update or delete, during BMT root calculation, etc.) we must access the left or right child of each node along the path. Accessing children is liable to cause a `ChildError` (e.g., `ChildNotFound`, `NodeIsLeaf`), and we must be able to report the key of the invalid child. Currently this is not possible for all keys because some key types, like `[u8; 32]` cannot be used in the error message.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a wrapper for a key type that can be used in the `ChildError` error message called `ChildErrorKey`. `ChildErrorKey` implements different display strategies depending on the type of key. Specifically:\r\n- A key of type `[u8; 8]` is displayed as a `u64` (big endian)\r\n- A key of type `[u8; 32]` is displayed as a hex encoded string of the key value\r\n\r\nThis allows fuel-core to use fallible SMT functions, like `update`, and to generate an error object with the expected key when an error happens.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/356/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/356/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/355", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/355/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/355/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/355/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/355", "id": 1587057565, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFju7mc5KGPfZ", "number": 355, "title": "Allow backwards jumps in the predicates", "user": {"login": "Voxelot", "id": 794823, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDgyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794823?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot", "html_url": "https://github.com/Voxelot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "Voxelot", "id": 794823, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDgyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794823?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot", "html_url": "https://github.com/Voxelot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Voxelot", "id": 794823, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDgyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794823?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot", "html_url": "https://github.com/Voxelot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Voxelot/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-02-16T05:43:59Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-24T22:58:15Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-24T22:58:14Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pulls/355", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/355", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/355.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/355.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-24T22:58:14Z"}, "body": "Before release [v0.26.1](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.26.1):\r\n\r\n*do not merge*\r\n\r\nMaster branch now contains breaking changes we don't want to include into fuel-core 0.17.x.

carrying over https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-crypto/pull/36 which aimed to address https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-crypto/issues/35, though after noticing a few other instances of the same issue decided to take a closer look throughout the crate.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes many of the unsafe constructors exposed in the `fuel-crypto` API, some due to the implementations not actually being `unsafe`, and some due to a revised implementation that safely encapsulates the unsafe behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe `Message` and `Signature` `from_bytes` and `from_bytes_ref` constructors have been documented to clarify expectations that they expect signature or cryptographically hashed data respectively.\r\n\r\nThe `PublicKey` and `SecretKey` `from_bytes_unchecked` constructors have been made private in order to ensure holding an instance of one of these types guarantees their inner byte arrays at least satisfies the curve.\r\n\r\nThe original, custom curve-checking functions have been removed in favour of using the secp256k1 library constructors directly which share the same implementation but with an added range check that is likely to get optimised out due to the use of const-sized arrays anyway.\r\n\r\nAdds some missing `#[repr(transparent)]` decorators to `fuel-types`.\r\n\r\nThe `FuelMnemonic` type provided unnecessary indirection between the user and the free function, and has been removed in favour of exposing the function directly from the crate root.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/346/reactions",

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/301. \r\nUsing the lifetimes in the trait or associated types of `Mappable` added complexity several times that forced the change like [this](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/blob/5727a2e7aa5ac0522d7ebd7a6bfd2df5b90e41d8/fuel-vm/src/interpreter/diff/storage.rs#L75) or [this](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/318/commits/a47439f06afb12c18cac6e38938faa1fdeef21bd). Those changes could be done differently, but still it would still be nice to know the owned type to simplify future development and not look for more complex solutions.\r\n\r\n## The change to solve the problem\r\n\r\nRenamed `Mappable::GetValue` into `Mappable::OwnedValue`. In the same way, added the `Mappable::OwnedKey` for `Mappable::Key` to know the owned type for key and value. Added `ToOwned` bounds for the `Key` and `Value`, added `From<ToOwned::Owned>` bound for `OwnedKey` and `OwnedValue`:\r\n```rust\r\n    type Key = Self::OwnedKey;\r\n    type OwnedKey = u64;\r\n    type Value = Self::OwnedValue;\r\n    type OwnedValue = Primitive;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the definition of the `Mappable` connects the `Key` with `OwnedKey` and `Value` with `OwnedValue` and allows easy conversion from reference into owned type.\r\n\r\nAdding those bounds doesn't allow conversion between `(&'a ..., &'a ...)` and owned `(..., ...)` tuples. So I removed lifetime `'a` and replaced the tuples with the new double storage key.\r\n\r\nDefined two double storage keys for `ContractsAssets` and `ContractsState`.", "reactions": {"url":

checkable more clear that it doesn't cover all potential checks.\r\n\r\nI originally set out to extend the checkable trait in the VM to replace the existing full check method with one that also includes predicate execution. However, after some more digging it didn't really make sense to enable predicate verification outside of CheckedTransactions, since predicate verification depends on extra verification not performed by the Checkable trait (such as computing free balances and tracking remaining gas).\r\n\r\nRemoving Checkable isn't a very clean solution either, since it's used within the impl's of IntoChecked for basic verification.\r\n\r\nUltimately Checkable just means that a transaction has some simple validation procedures that should be performed before attempting to convert into a fully checked transaction type. This is limited to checks that don't compute any sort of dynamic outputs based on input (i.e. remaining gas or free balances) that would be cached as metadata for further execution later on. So this PR scaled back the original ambitions [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/307#issuecomment-1386107745) to just adding clarification about what this trait is useful for.",

"2023-02-07T06:53:36Z"}, "body": "*This PR is based on the monorepo branch, #274.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a pretty significant refactor of the `fuel-asm` crate and updates the `fuel-tx` and `fuel-vm` crates accordingly. The goal is to improve type-safety around the `Instruction` and `Opcode` types, and to derive all items related to the `Instruction` type from a single source of truth: the `impl_instructions!` table.\r\n\r\n## Name Changes\r\n\r\nThe following renames have been performed as a part of this PR to more closely align with [the spec](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-specs/master/vm/index.html#semantics):\r\n\r\n- `Opcode` -> `Instruction`\r\n- `OpcodeRepr` -> `Opcode`.\r\n\r\nThe old `Instruction` type has been removed, as it tended to encourage some anti-patterns. Namely, converting to the old `Instruction` type meant we *always* unpacked every possible register ID and immediate value, even if they weren't relevant to the instruction variant specified by the opcode. Further, it allowed access to register IDs and immediates that weren't valid at all to the instruction specified by the opcode.\r\n\r\nInstead, the new `Instruction` type requires matching the specific instruction type specified by the opcode before allowing to unpack the valid register IDs and immediate. This also helps to avoid some of the unnecessary unpacking that would occur on every instruction within the `Interpreter::_instruction` step.\r\n\r\nAnother notable difference is that the new `Instruction` type is *packed* (represented in 4 bytes) while the previous equivalent `Opcode` type was *unpacked* (closer to ~40 bytes). The idea here is that the `Instruction` type should remain in a packed form until the moment it is interpreted, at which point only the relevant data is unpacked based on its opcode variant.\r\n\r\n## Handwriting ASM\r\n\r\nThe process of handwriting ASM has also changed slightly. Previously, handwriting ASM took advantage of the unpacked `Opcode` variant, e.g. `Opcode::ADDI(ra, rb, imm)`. Seeing as the new equivalent `Instruction` enum is packed, we instead provide an `op` module with a convenience function for constructing each type of instruction, e.g. `op::addi(ra, rb, imm)`.\r\n\r\nBy using a function for constructing handwritten instructions, we can also validate the register ID and immediate arguments to ensure the values specified are within the 6/12/18/24-bit expected range and produce an error otherwise. As these functions are solely for handwriting ASM, which is generally only useful for writing tests or benchmarking, we *panic* in the case that a given register ID or immediate value is out of range. On the other hand, during bytecode decoding, we do *not* check the value range for register IDs or immediates as we know that the values cannot possibly lie outside of the range of valid values when packed within the 32-bit raw instruction layout.\r\n\r\n## `impl_instructions!`\r\n\r\nThe new `impl_instructions!` macro allows us to specify a table of all instructions as a single source of truth, from which the declarations and implementations for `Opcode` and `Instruction` (and the nested instruction variant types) are derived. The idea here is to reduce the need to update multiple areas of the crate each time an instruction is added-to or removed-from the spec, removing some scope for mistakes.\r\n\r\nThat said, the `macro_rules!` implementation is of course not as easy to read as plain copy-paste branches and types. In order to make it a little more accessible, I've added some detailed docs to the `macros` module which aims to explain how each of the types and implementations are derived. I've also attempted to separate and comment each of the different sets of pattern matching branches within the `macro_rules!` definition to help guide future contributions.\r\n\r\n## No Reserved or Undefined Opcodes\r\n\r\nThe old RESERVED* and Undefined variants have been ommitted from the `Instruction` and `Opcode` types. Instead, we consider encountering these during bytecode decoding as error cases. By making it impossible to construct an `Instruction` or `Opcode` from a reserved or undefined value, we can guarantee that `Instruction` or `Opcode` instances within our code must be valid for a lot more cases.\r\n\r\n## Typed `RegId`, `Imm*`\r\n\r\nWhen packing or unpacking instructions from/to their respective register IDs and immediates, we now use unit structs rather than type aliased primitive types. This allows us to guarantee correct masking by construction, and avoids the need to double-check potentially incorrect masks when inspecting the unpacked instruction data.\r\n\r\nAs a convenience, `Index<RegId>` is implemented for `[T]` where `[T]: Index<usize>`. This makes indexing with the typed `RegId`s into the interpreter's `registers` array more ergonomic and avoids the need to cast to `usize` everywhere.\r\n\r\nThese types are currently only used for instruction packing/unpacking, though in future PRs we might benefit from further type safety by progressively replacing our use of the old `RegisterId` and `Immediate*` type aliases in favour of the new types.\r\n\r\n## Instruction Debug impl\r\n\r\nA custom Debug implementation is provided for the new `Instruction` type to make it easier to grok an instruction's contents, e.g.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", op::addi(0x10, 0x11, 10));\r\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", op::sub(0x10, 0x11, 0x12));\r\n```\r\n\r\nprints as\r\n\r\n```console\r\nADDI { ra: 16, rb: 17, imm: 10 }\r\nSUB { ra: 16, rb: 17, rc: 18 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a bit easier to read than the default implementation which would only show the packed data and look more like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nADDI(ADDI([56, 142, 241]))\r\nSUB(SUB([56, 212, 128]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Removal of `io::{Read/Write}` Implementations\r\n\r\nThese implementations seemed a little out of place in `fuel-asm`, and noticing that we don't appear to use these downstream, I decided to omit these. Instead, we can always read/write `u32`s or `u8`s and use the provided `Instruction` conversions from there. \r\n\r\n## Breaking !!\r\n\r\nAs there's quite a bit of breakage throughout these changes, I plan to leave this in draft at least until I've got a follow-up PR ready at the `fuel-core` repo as I imagine there are probably loads of tests, etc there too that will also need updating. I plan to help shepherd these changes up through the SDK and Sway repos too.\r\n\r\n## Follow-up\r\n\r\nThere's still a lot more that can be done to improve type-safety throughout `fuel-vm`. This PR aims to limit the scope of changes to those related to the `Instruction` and `Opcode` types as there's already a lot here. I'll aim to open some follow-up issues I've come across during this refactor and link them back here tomorrow.", "reactions": {"url":
