In particular, this allows imports to any submodule of the current module.\r\n\r\nHowever, whenever that logic was triggered by the compiler the destination path was always absolute. The only reason this worked was that the logic was only ever triggered on the root module.\r\n\r\nTo reflect this behavior I have therefore moved the import semantics to the `Root` struct, and made it clear in the comments that the paths are assumed to be absolute.\r\n\r\nThis also reflects the fact that once the module structure has been populated with the imported entities we don't actually need the import logic anymore, so it shouldn't be located in the `Module` struct. (Name resolution should obviously stay in the `Module` struct, so that logic has not been moved).\r\n\r\nI have left a couple of TODOs in the code to remind myself where I need to make changes when I

every time I reload the window in vscode (restarting forc-lsp), the list of forc-lsp processes grew. I believe it's because out `shutdown_server` function doesn't actually kill the server (it has to stay alive to respond to the shutdown request). We've had problems with zombie forc-lsp processes for a while. \r\n\r\nLuckily, the LSP spec provides a client heartbeat mechanism by providing `processId` in the initialize request. When we have that ID, we can periodically check if the client is still alive, and if not, kill the server.\r\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t figure out how to call `shutdown_server` from within the thread, but

containing the process ID (pid) of the running instance of the software. This mechanism prevents multiple instances of the software from running simultaneously by checking the existence and content of the lock file. If the lock file exists and contains a valid pid, the struct will error gracefully to avoid conflicts. If the lock file is missing or contains an invalid pid, the struct will proceed by removing the file.  This ensures that only one instance of the software can run at a time and it avoids stale locking to prevent future instances\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant

The contextual information provided is taken from the `ctx.type_annotation()` but always adapted according to the semantics of the type-checked expression.\r\n- fixes #5583 and #5581 by combining the contextual information coming from the `ctx.type_annotation()` with the one coming from the enum and struct instantiation and declaration.\r\n- fixes #5598 by forcing the name-based and not structure-based identity. In other words, two enums or structs are considered equal only if they whole `call_path`s are equal. Up to now, we were expecting only the enum or struct _names_ to be equal, which was treating types with same names and structures (variants or fields) as equal although they were defined in different modules.\r\n\r\nThe PR also introduces parsing of references to mutable values (`&mut T`). Since this addition does not overlap with the above bug fixes, it was left as is, and can be fully ignored during the review. Other changes related to references to mutable values are removed from the code from type-checking onward to make this PR only fixing the issues. Continuation on references to mutable values will be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nCloses #5559, #5597, #5492, #5583, #5581, #5598.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation where relevant (API docs, the reference, and the Sway book).\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n- [ ] I have added (or requested a maintainer to add) the necessary `Breaking*` or `New Feature` labels where relevant.\r\n- [x] I have done my best to ensure that my PR adheres to [the Fuel Labs Code Review Standards](https://github.com/FuelLabs/rfcs/blob/master/text/code-standards/external-contributors.md).\r\n- [x] I have requested a review from the relevant team or maintainers.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5643/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5643/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5642", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5642/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5642/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5642/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pull/5642", "id": 2147174947, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE7xKys5ni8dU", "number": 5642, "title": "Refactor scoped namespace accesses and clones in type check context", "user": {"login": "tritao", "id": 602268, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYwMjI2OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/602268?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao", "html_url": "https://github.com/tritao", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tritao/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2994459512, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyOTk0NDU5NTEy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/labels/compiler", "name": "compiler", "color": "5ADFA4", "default": false, "description": "General compiler.

#5622.\r\n\r\nWhen generating the IR for constant and variable declarations the name being declared is not added to the local environment if the initializer cannot be compiled. This can happen when initializing a constant using a non-constant expression.\r\n\r\nSince the name isn't added to the environment, and since we attempt to continue compilation after an error, any attempt to use the name later in the code will cause the name to not be found, which in turn causes the IR converter to throw an ICE because it assumes that all used names are in scope.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by not throwing the initializer error until the name has been added to the environment. Note that\r\n1. The initializer must be compiled before the name is added to the environment. The name should not be in scope during its own initialization.\r\n2. #5602 is blocking a more elegant solution to this problem. The lack of a `Never` type means that the call to `convert_resolved_typeid` may fail if the initializer diverges, and since that call must be made before the new name can be added to the environment we check for termination first. The order of operations is therefore currently a) compile the initializer, then b) check that the initializer did not result in an error and did not diverge, then c) resolve the type of the name being declared, then d) add the name to the environment, and finally e) throw an error if the initializer resulted in an error. Once the `Never` type is introduced we can move the terminator check to the end of that sequence.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation where relevant (API docs, the reference, and the Sway book).\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n- [x] I have added (or requested a maintainer to add) the necessary `Breaking*` or `New Feature` labels where relevant.\r\n- [x] I have done my best to ensure that my PR adheres to [the Fuel Labs Code Review Standards](https://github.com/FuelLabs/rfcs/blob/master/text/code-standards/external-contributors.md).\r\n- [x] I have requested a review from the relevant team or maintainers.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5631/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5631/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5630", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5630/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5630/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5630/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pull/5630", "id": 2141503555, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE7xKys5nPe4V", "number": 5630, "title": "Encapsulation of Storage Types", "user": {"login": "bitzoic", "id": 54727135, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzI3MTM1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54727135?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic", "html_url": "https://github.com/bitzoic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitzoic/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3311330758, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMzExMzMwNzU4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/labels/lib:%20std", "name": "lib: std", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false, "description": "Standard library"}, {"id": 3944946777, "node_id": "LA_kwDOE7xKys7rIxxZ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/labels/breaking", "name": "breaking", "color": "FC2519", "default": false, "description": "May cause existing user code to break.

This change means that calls to `Root` and `Module` must now explicitly go through `Namespace`, since that is the type that is passed along during typechecking.\r\n\r\nI'm submitting the PR now because there have been changes to `master` while I've been working on this, and the changes are really difficult to merge, so I want `master` to be relatively stable.\r\n\r\nSubsequent PRs will:\r\n- Eliminate the `dst` parameter from all import functions (the destination is always the current module).\r\n- Move all import functions to `Namespace` (they currently reside in `Module` where they aren't needed, and where they require a clone the module path to work).\r\n- Move `Namespace::init` to `Root`, and change how it is used (it currently holds a constant declaration of `CONTRACT_ID` for contract modules, and that declaration is cloned into every submodule. The nice way to do this is to declare it in the root module and implicitly import it into each submodule).\r\n- Eliminate the `Option` part of `Module::name` (modules are not allowed to be nameless - the option only exists because they root module can in principle be nameless, but it ought to be named based on the package the module structure is in).\r\n- Fix the import and name resolution functions so that they don't treat absolute paths as relative (this should fix some of the performance issues we're seeing).\r\n- Make `Namespace::root` a reference so that the entire module structure isn't cloned for every submodule (this requires a change in ownership of the root module).\r\n- Introduce reexports in the form of `pub use`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step in fixing #5498.

The overall effort related to references is tracked in #5063.\r\n\r\n`[]` is defined for references using this recursive definition: `<reference>[<index>] := (*<reference>)[<index>]`.\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the need for the dereferencing operator `*` when working with references to arrays:\r\n\r\n```Sway\r\nlet array = [1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\nlet r = &&&array;\r\n\r\nassert((***r)[0] == r[0]);\r\n```\r\n```Sway\r\nlet r = &&&[ &&[1, 2, 3], &&[4, 5, 6] ];\r\nassert(r[0][2] == 3);\r\nassert(r[1][0] == 4);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the PR fixes two previously existing issues (see below screenshots):\r\n- the misleading error message on type not implementing the \"index\" method when indexing a non-indexable type.\r\n- the broken error span and expression text when indexing a non-indexable type in reassignments.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![No method named index found for type](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/assets/4142833/4693510d-bcb4-45ca-8f41-7988a8d87b3e)\r\n\r\n![Not an indexable expression - Before](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/assets/4142833/6b8f28f0-25db-4ba8-b6a5-3d5468c70cdc)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Type is not indexable](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/assets/4142833/df160b3b-312e-40dc-b32f-71786ee382ea)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my

the functions implemented on `TokenMap` to remove clones where possible, and instead return the `RefMulti` type from `DashMap` directly.

Since the change is a breaking change, relevant suggestion on how to fix the particular issue are given.\r\n\r\nTo avoid an abrupt breaking change, the errors are temporarily turned into warnings. These warnings will become errors in the upcoming versions of Sway. The demo section below demonstrate how the errors will look like, and how a one warning equivalent looks now.\r\n\r\nStandard library structs like `Vec` or `String`, are adapted where needed by adding the `pub` keyword to the fields that are accessed outside of the struct declaration module. Some of these fields should very likely remain public, but some, like e.g., `RawBytes::ptr` or `Vec::buf` should be private. Adjusting the standard library to properly utilize private fields is out of scope of this PR and will be done separately. I expect breaking changes in the STD once we start modeling structs keeping encapsulation in mind.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PR:\r\n- migrates [annotate_snippets](https://github.com/rust-lang/annotate-snippets-rs) crate to its latest version (breaking changes)\r\n- removes a redundant non-existing field error and orchestrates non-existing field error with privacy errors\r\n- replaces an invalid and misleading error when accessing fields on storage elements that are not structs\r\n\r\nCloses #4692.\r\n\r\n## Known limitations\r\n\r\nThere is an issue in displaying multi-line code snippets, which is independent of these changes, but wasn't apparent before. The issue is visible in the demo section below, where the struct bodies are sometimes not fully shown, and they should be. This issue is reported in #5499 and will be solved in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Demo (an excerpt :smile:)\r\n\r\n### Private struct field is inaccessible\r\n\r\n![Private struct field is

was adding values to the `TypeEngine` to do a unification check afterward.\r\n\r\nThis increased `TypeInfo`s in type engine quadratically with the number of traits already inserted. Because for each new trait inserted a new `TypeInfo::Custom`\r\n would be inserted for each existing trait.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by doing the unification check directly on the type parameters\r\n instead of constructing a temporary `TypeInfo::Custom` with them.\r\n\r\nFor `should_pass/language/generic_trait_constraints` which uses lib-std the number of entries in the type engine changed from >194k to <93k.

The PR introduces `TerminatorValue` which forces the converter to handle diverging expressions properly. There were checks for divergence scattered around the code before, but it's now been made more systematic and thus more robust.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this change allows for early returns from some functions. For instance, if the condition of a `while` diverges, then we don't need to generate code for the body of the loop. In fact, if an expression does diverge then the algorithm assumes that a terminator value (e.g., a `branch` or a `return`) is returned, but this was not always the case, and led to a number of spurious checks that probably didn't quite work.\r\n\r\nThe heavy lifting is done by the macro `return_on_termination_or_extract`, which acts as destructor of `TerminatorValue`s.\r\n\r\nMost changes are straightforward, but do review the functions `compile_lazy_op`, `compile_fn_call`, `compile_if`, `compile_while_loop`, `compile_var_decl` and `compile_array_expr` extra carefully, as they contain changes to the conversion algorithm. Mostly the changes are small, but they need an extra pair of eyes. In a few cases the algorithm was and still is a bit convoluted, but that's because the typechecker unhelpfully assigns `Unknown` instead of `Never` to diverging expressions, so the first sub-expression needs to be compiled and divergence checked before we can generate IR for anything that relies on the type of the expression.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have taken the liberty of removing `Value::is_diverging()` and using its alias `Value::is_terminator()` everywhere. The concept of divergence lives in the source language, whereas the concept of terminators lives in the IR, so `is_terminator` seems to be more appropriate at this stage of the compilation.\r\n\r\nFixes #2051. \r\n\r\nPartial fix of #5438 (the call to `deterministically_aborts()` is removed).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I

https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-vscode-plugin/pull/166\r\n\r\nAdds a [DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol//) server as a new forc plugin, `forc-debug`. This enables a UI debugging experience in IDEs such as VSCode.\r\n\r\nFor now, only debugging forc tests is supported. Users can:\r\n- set breakpoints inside of forc tests\r\n- step through the test, one VM instruction at a time, or continue to the next breakpoint\r\n- debug through multiple tests sequentially\r\n- see the VM register values in the IDE while debugging\r\n- see the current VM opcode, its inputs, and/or immediate value when when the VM is stopped\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/assets/47993817/24e2016c-d96c-4ef6-931f-8a4ce4f1386b\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/assets/47993817/5f0fed49-b278-4074-a1a1-d37de00776f8\r\n\r\n![Feb-01-2024 21-46-40](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/assets/47993817/23ade516-0068-4f7c-b7bf-b4142137f72c)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Local testing\r\n\r\n1. Install `forc-debug`\r\n2. Copy this sample launch.json in the VSCode workspace with sway code to debug:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n        \"type\": \"sway\",\r\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n        \"name\": \"Debug Sway\",\r\n        \"program\": \"${file}\"\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Follow [the steps](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-vscode-plugin/blob/master/docs/testing.md) for testing the VSCode extension\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n- Breakpoints only work inside of the project/workspace being debugged\r\n- Stack trace support is limited\r\n- Not every line has source maps. Once debugging, \"verified\" breakpoints will show red and \"unverified\" (no source maps) will be greyed out.\r\n- Watch/repl expressions are not yet supported\r\n- Step into/out of is not supported\r\n- If you click \"step over\" many times in rapid succession, the server takes a while to catch up.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5394 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n-

A naming convention that is consistent across the standard library, docs, and examples is critical for clarity.\r\n \r\nIn the following PR I formalize the use of the words \"Asset\" and \"Coin\". \r\n\r\n- An \"Asset\" is a Native Asset on Fuel and has the associated `AssetId` type. Assets are distinguishable from one another.\r\n- A \"Coin\" represents a singular unit of an Asset. Coins of the same Asset are not distinguishable from one another.\r\n\r\nThe changes made reflect the distinction that Fuel does not use tokens like other ecosystems such as Ethereum and uses Native Assets with a UTXO design instead. \r\n\r\nThe Asset and Coin terminology is also consistent the fuel-vm's input and outputs types. This is already seen in the `input.sw` file with the `Input::Coin` enum and `output.sw`'s `Output::Coin` enum in the standard library respectively.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nImports using the `token` import should now use the `asset` import.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sway\r\nuse std::token::mint;\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sway\r\nuse std::asset::mint;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have

`||` and `&&`, where, if both sides of the operator diverge, the join block of the resulting branching control-flow graph would get a block argument of type `()`, but where the code in the block expected a `bool`, causing a type error if the argument was used for anything.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation where relevant (API docs, the reference, and the Sway book).\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my

parsed declarations. This is basically a clone of `DeclEngine` but only used for untyped parsed declarations.\r\n\r\nDeclarations stored in this new engine are referenced by a `ParsedDeclId` which again is analogous to our existing `DeclId`.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for introducing this is to be able to reference parsed declarations during a multi-stage semantic analysis / type-checking process. A cross-referencing mechanism between untyped/typed AST declarations will still need to be implemented.\r\n\r\nJust to note, `rustc` provides a similar architecture with their `NodeId` / `DefId`, which provide a similar role to our `ParsedDeclId` / `DeclId`, except we only support storing top-level AST entities, whereas the system in Rust from what I understand can also be used to reference individual expressions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation where relevant (API docs, the reference, and the Sway book).\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n- [x] I have added (or requested a maintainer to add) the necessary `Breaking*` or `New Feature` labels where relevant.\r\n- [x] I have done my best to ensure that my PR adheres to [the Fuel Labs Code Review Standards](https://github.com/FuelLabs/rfcs/blob/master/text/code-standards/external-contributors.md).\r\n- [x] I have requested a review from the relevant team or maintainers.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5443/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/sway/issues/5443/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
