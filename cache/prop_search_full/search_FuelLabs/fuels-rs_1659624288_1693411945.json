This meant that the user had to pay attention on the signing order and  make sure to offset the index if some witnesses where already set.\r\n\r\nThis PR automates the whole process.\r\n\r\nProposed workflow:\r\n- wallet's `sign_transaction` now accepts a `TransactionBuilder`\r\n- when a wallet signs a `TransactionBuilder` the intention is saved in `UnresolvedSignatures`\r\n- when the user builds the transaction all signatures are resolved\r\n- after building the transaction can not be changed except with `append_witness` - this allows the user to add custom witnesses and it will not affect the `TxId`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, building a transaction will fail if there are signed resources that are missing corresponding signatures.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: \r\n- `send_transaction`, `dry_run`, `dry_run_no_validation` and `estimate_transaction_cost` need ownership of the `tx`.\r\n- removed witness index from `Input` and corresponding functions\r\n- wallet's `sign_transaction` now accepts a

`ParamType` introduced here is called `ParamType::StdString` because `ParamType::String` represents statically-sized Sway strings. I think it would be better to use `String` for the dynamic type, and `StaticString` for statically-sized ones, but I think this refactoring would make the PR less clear.\r\n- <s>I need to figure out what's wrong with how I encode the `String` data, this is why the test is weird. </s>", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/1042/reactions", "total_count": 1,

#959\r\n\r\nI've explored several approaches to make our API consistent here. \r\n\r\nOne option was to have `TransactionResponse` hold a `Box<dyn Transaction>, but because of the object safety requirements, this had the following downsides:\r\n- No `Into<FuelTransaction>` super trait possible, this would need to become a separate method\r\n- `TransactionResponse` would no longer be `Clone`\r\n- Box needs to be cloned internally to keep `with_` methods + a Box would have to be returned which could cause confusion\r\n- And the worst one, a user would need to downcast the tx from a TransactionResponse to either `Script` or `Create`\r\n\r\nThe second option was to use an enum for the implementors of `Transaction` and then have the enum implement it too. The downside here is that we get a lot of repeated match statements to delegate every method of `Transaction` to the corresponding variant. Macros didn't provide a significant improvement here either.\r\n\r\nUltimately I decided to keep the enum but not implement `Transaction` for it. This means that we don't change our API anywhere else but also that the user has to potentially match the enum every time to use the underlying `Transaction` methods.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I

`ChainId`(`ConsensusParameters`). \r\n- Now tokens should be transferred to the contract first, and after you can transfer them via `SMO` or another transfer. So in some tests first we need to transfer money to the contract first.\r\n- Replaced all unsafe code from `fuel-crypto` with safe analog.\r\n- The `produce_blocks` function is updated and doesn't require `TimeParameters`.\r\n- On the `fuel-tx`/`fuel-core` side now, there is a difference in whether the message contains data. If data is empty, it is `MessageCoin` that acts like a `Coin`(has the same rules during execution). If the data field is not empty, then it is a retryable message(or `MessageData`). Messages like this can't be used to pay a transaction fee, and if the execution fails, the message is not consumed(you can use it again in the next transactions). More about them you can read in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/946. Also, the API changed for resources and not it is `Coins` again. Because of that, some tests now require messages with empty data to be able to spend them.\r\n- Removed redundant usage of `MessageId`. Now the identifier of the message is a `Nonce`.\r\n- Removed `Output::Message`. Now you don't need to specify it in the outputs. Because of that `SMO` opcode doesn't require a message output index anymore. \r\n- The proof API is updated with a new design: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1046. If you want to prove the block at height `X` you need at least a committed `X + 1` block.\r\n\r\nBecause some of opcodes were updated the examples require a new `sway`. The corresponding PR: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/pull/4525. It creates a cycle of dependencies with this PR.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/829 https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/933\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGES: \r\n- `Predicate::set_provider` now returns a `Result` because it can fail if the \"new\" provider has different consensus parameters than the consensus parameters used previously\r\n- `Predicate` can be loaded with a provider by using `load_from_with_provider` and `from_code_and_provider`. The `from_code` and `load_from` remain, and use default `ConsensusParameters` value. This can be discussed further.\r\n- `Provider::new` now takes a `ConsensusParameters` argument, so we can avoid changing the API of downstream clients. \r\n- `setup_test_client` now returns `ConsensusParameters` of the client. This was either this or `setup_test_provider` would have to change, and the former is much less used than the latter.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/950/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 4, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/950/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/947", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/947/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/947/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/947/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/pull/947", "id": 1690761659, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGTqqwM5Pf8Hr", "number": 947, "title": "chore: update `sway` to `0.38.0` and `fuel-core` to `0.17.11`", "user": {"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "xgreenx", "id": 18346821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ2ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18346821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx", "html_url": "https://github.com/xgreenx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xgreenx/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-05-01T12:36:55Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T18:57:24Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-01T18:57:18Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/pulls/947", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/pull/947", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/pull/947.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/pull/947.patch", "merged_at": "2023-05-01T18:57:18Z"}, "body": "Bumping the sway to `0.38.0` and `fuel-core` to `0.17.11`.

The `Predicate` struct now has a method called `with_configurables` that creates a new updated predicate. Here is an example:\r\n```rust\r\n    abigen!(Predicate(\r\n        name = \"MyPredicate\",\r\n        abi = \"packages/fuels/tests/predicates/predicate_configurables/out/debug/predicate_configurables-abi.json\"\r\n    ));\r\n\r\n    let new_struct = StructWithGeneric {\r\n        field_1: 32u8,\r\n        field_2: 64,\r\n    };\r\n    let new_enum = EnumWithGeneric::VariantTwo;\r\n\r\n    let configurables = MyPredicateConfigurables::new()\r\n        .set_STRUCT(new_struct.clone())\r\n        .set_ENUM(new_enum.clone());\r\n\r\n    let predicate_data = MyPredicateEncoder::encode_data(8u8, true, new_struct, new_enum);\r\n\r\n    let mut predicate: Predicate = Predicate::load_from(\r\n        \"tests/predicates/predicate_configurables/out/debug/predicate_configurables.bin\",\r\n    )?\r\n    .with_data(predicate_data)\r\n    .with_configurables(configurables);\r\n```\r\n- I had to move `Configurables` to `fuels-core` to avoid a circular dependency with `fuels-programs`.\r\n- the `abigen!` name field for predicates does not include `Encoder` anymore. I append both `Encoder` and `Configurables` on the provided name.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation.\r\n- [x] I have added

cargo book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html):\r\n> Other than optional and features, inherited dependencies cannot use any other dependency key (such as version or default-features).\r\n\r\nWe've been inheriting workspace deps and then trying to disable default features. Cargo doesn't support this. If a dep has default features enabled when defined at the workspace level, those features are there to stay. You can only add more to them via `features` or make the dep itself optional in the place you're using it via `optional=true`.\r\n\r\nThe check for this still hasn't landed in cargo stable. I opted not to add a CI step to build `fuels-rs` with the nightly toolchain to check for regressions in this regard.\r\n\r\nFunctionally nothing has changed. The changes are primarily so we don't mislead ourselves and so we don't run into an error when this does reach stable.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n- [x] I have added necessary labels.\r\n- [x] I have done my best to ensure that my PR adheres to [the Fuel Labs Code Review Standards](https://github.com/FuelLabs/rfcs/blob/master/text/code-standards/external-contributors.md).\r\n- [x] I have requested a review from the relevant

issue for context. Only implementation notes to follow.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* `Abigen` code will now refer to types through the `fuels` package since it is now wasm compatible. @deekerno @ra0x3 the indexer should now just include `fuels` as a dependency taking care to disable the default features (since `std` is the default). You can access `fuels_core` stuff through `fuels::core`; `fuels_types` through `fuels::types`; `fuels_macros` through `fuels::macros`. \r\n\r\nThe hotfix is still in place -- mostly to make the Abigen code-writing experience more enjoyable. If we remove it completely then we'd have to do a `no_std` check whenever we use a Vec, `format!`, `String` etc. \r\n\r\nThis way we always write `::std::vec::Vec` and leave the rest to the (now smaller) wasm hotfix.\r\n\r\nAs we become more wasm compatible the rest of the `fuels-*` crates will become exposed through `fuels` reexports.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any

with: @hal3e \r\n\r\nYou can now generate bindings for scripts and predicates via the boilerplate-reduction-helper `setup_program_test` (formerly `setup_contract_test`). You can also create a script instance via `LoadScript`. Example:\r\n```rust\r\n    setup_program_test!(\r\n        Wallets(\"wallet\"),\r\n        Abigen(Script(\r\n            name = \"MyScript\",\r\n            project = \"packages/fuels/tests/types/scripts/script_generics\"\r\n        )),\r\n        LoadScript(\r\n            name = \"script_instance\",\r\n            script = \"MyScript\",\r\n            wallet = \"wallet\"\r\n        )\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\n We decided against doing `LoadPredicate` because predicates have to undergo further tweaking after being created. We felt it was best that we leave the whole process visible.\r\n \r\n The PR isn't that big but GitHub didn't detect files being moved around.\r\n \r\n###  Breaking changes:\r\n* Name was changed from `setup_contract_test` into `setup_program_test`\r\n* Command for generating bindings (`Abigen`) now requires the program type to be stated. Before: `Abigen(name=\"...`, now: `Abigen(Contract(name=\"...\"` etc.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have linked to any relevant issues.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation.\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n- [x] I have added necessary labels.\r\n- [x] I have done my best to ensure that my PR adheres to [the Fuel Labs Code Review
