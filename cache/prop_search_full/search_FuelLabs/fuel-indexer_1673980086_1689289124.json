hidden WASM runtime error\r\n- Also swaps `try_from` for `from` (if `from` fails, we will get a panic anyway, so might as well use that instead of `try_from` - less code)\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update your `start_block` to `8320` in `fuel_explorer.manifest.yaml`\r\n- [ ] Rebuild your modules `bash scripts/utils/build_test_wasm_module.bash`\r\n- [ ] Run the explorer on beta-3\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run -p fuel-indexer -- run --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80 --manifest

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1233\r\n- [Previously the docker build step used to take around ~40 mins](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/actions/runs/5509952533/jobs/10043437988)\r\n  - With this change this step now takes around 60 mins\r\n    - Twice as long cause it's building two images\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] View/use the image pushed by this PR \r\n  - That image is here https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/pkgs/container/fuel-indexer/108693557?tag=sha-e99a5b9\r\n  - You should be able to pull down this image and run it on a `aarch64-apple-darwin` target \r\n- [ ] Should be able to run the hello-world example w/o having to build the image manually\r\n  - `cd examples/hello-world && docker compose up`\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- chore: add docker multiplatform

https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/1031\r\n  - I just converted that `enum` into our `T: Decoder` pattern\r\n- Adds support for many-to-many relationships (or join tables)\r\n  - This covers the first 50% of https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/947\r\n  - Still need to persist the data into the m2m table and allow for a way to query though\r\n- Integrates last remaining types from #897 \r\n  - The v1 block explorer is essentially finished!! \ud83e\udd73 \ud83e\udd73 \r\n\r\n### Some (really rough) stats\r\n- Stats are just from a snapshot of my computer\r\n- A 2022 M2 chip with 24GB RAM, 8 CPUs\r\n```bash\r\n> uname -a\r\nDarwin [..] Darwin Kernel Version 22.1.0: [ ... ]/RELEASE_ARM64_T8112 arm64\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 32 blocks/second\r\n- ~100% CPU\r\n- 30+ threads\r\n  - Why so many threads for a single executor? \r\n    - Are they sqlx threads?\r\n- Data size (at Block#125060)\r\n  - 874 MB / 125060 (blocks) = ~7KB per block\r\n```bash\r\npostgres=#

\"virtual_optional_inner\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"foo\",\r\n          \"size\": 1\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"bar\",\r\n          \"size\": 2\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Test the explorer!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest examples/fuel-explorer/fuel-explorer/fuel_explorer.manifest.yaml --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Examples should work (dockerized and non-dockerized)\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- feature: support for

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default behavior of `forc index kill` to send the `TERM` signal and adds a `-9` flag to send the `KILL` signal instead. This way, the behavior matches the Linux `kill` command.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this is that `fuel-indexer` may be running with `--embedded-database`, in which case the current behavior of `forc index kill` won't allow `fuel-indexer` to shut down the embedded `postgres` process\u2014it will be left alive.\r\n\r\nIf the user attempts to start `fuel-indexer` again with `--embedded` database, they will get an error.\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\nPlease provide the _exact_ testing steps for the reviewer(s) if this PR requires testing.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\nPlease add a neat

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR downgrades `fuel-core-client` to `v0.17.2` as the move to the latest version negatively impacted our ability to index information from the beta-3 testnet. It also downgrades a few other dependencies as well; special care has been taken to minimize the amount of downgrading necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen either beta-3 is upgraded or a new testnet is released, we should be able to revert this PR to get rid of the manual type conversions and make only a few necessary adjustments to move to the required version.\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\nCI should pass.\r\n\r\n#### Manual Testing\r\n\r\nPlease compile the `fuel-explorer` example and run the following command: \r\n```\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest examples/fuel-explorer/fuel-explorer/fuel_explorer.manifest.yaml --run-migrations --verbose --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see that beta-3 is being successfully indexed once more.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nFor the testing suite, I had to downgrade `fuels-rs` to `v0.40` (our previously used version); this was because of difficulties with the built-in `fuel-core` helpers (for starting the test node) and working with the downgraded types.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/1028/reactions",

There aren't any real testing steps here; as a proof, in the `fuel-explorer` example, the instantiation for the `Consensus` type has been changed to leverage the new instantiation functionality implemented by this PR. Feel free to make the same changes on `develop` and verify that they do not work there and that the changes *do* work on this branch.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- Add `From` trait impls to each member of a union type\r\n-- Add `generate_from_traits_for_union` helper\r\n-- Combine instantiation trait generators into the flow of `generate_object_trait_impls`\r\n- Add `field_type_optionality`

#963.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds a `::new()` method to entity types that automatically calculates an ID for the user so that they do not have to come up with their own way to create one. It also adds a `::get_or_create()` method that will load a record from the DB if present or create the struct as described above.\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\nThe `hello-world` example has been changed to illustrate the new instantiation methods.\r\n1. Ensure the test DB is cleared and that the `hello-world` WASM module has been freshly built.\r\n2. `cargo run -p hello-world-node`\r\n3. `cargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --run-migrations --manifest examples/hello-world/hello-indexer/hello_indexer.manifest.yaml --verbose`\r\n4. `cargo run -p hello-world-data`\r\n5. Check the output of the indexer; you should see that the original and `::new()` methods insert data into the DB, and that `::get_or_create()` loads a record from the database.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- Add a number of `HashSet`s for checking whether a field type implements the requisite traits\r\n- Add a helper function for creating the necessary method implementations\r\n",

\"Fuel Indexer\" project (right-hand sidebar)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- This PR adds support for `union` types in GraphQL\r\n- `union` types are created using a the set of fields between all the union's members\r\n- Some notes:\r\n  - Tables _will_ be created from union types (even if the contents of the union are themselves unindexable)\r\n- `union` types work very similarly to `object` types\r\n  - The main difference is, when using an `object`, the fields are directly on the object\r\n  - However, when using a `union`, you have to look up the members of the union in order to find the set of fields shared between all members of the union\r\n- `union` fields are _all_ optional, except the `ID` field.\r\n- Tests were added\r\n- I will integrate this new functionality into the explorer after this PR is merged\r\n- [More detail on why this approach](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/988#issuecomment-1584518964)\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tests were added so CI should pass\r\n- [ ] Run the service on beta-3 with the test indexer and inspect your tables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest

\"Fuel Indexer\" project (right-hand sidebar)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- Whilst deploying an indexer to the playground I noticed authentication was buggy\r\n- This PR fixes 3 issues:\r\n  - Removes auth from `register_indexer_assets`\r\n  - Fixes sqlx type issue in `queries::indexer_owned_by`\r\n  - Uses the public key in `index_registry` (not the issuer)\r\n- This was previously unnoticed cause I never run the indexer locally with auth (will change that going forward)\r\n- Obviously an integration test would help here. Happy for anyone to open that PR ;) \r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] You will need two accounts in your `forc-wallet` (account index `0` and account index `1`)\r\n- [ ] Start the service with auth enabled on beta3\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80 --auth-enabled --auth-strategy jwt --jwt-secret abcdefg --jwt-issuer FuelLabs\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Authenticate using your first account `forc index auth`\r\n- [ ] Use this token to deploy an indexer `forc index deploy --auth $TOKEN1`\r\n  - On master this fails due to the SQLx type issue _and_ the unnecessary authentication check\r\n- [ ] Authenticate using your second account `forc index auth`\r\n- [ ] Use this token to try to remove the indexer your just deployed `forc index remove --auth $TOKEN2`\r\n  - This will fail as `Unauthorized`\r\n \r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- fix: various auth updates\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

logs were printed for each contract and transaction in the block. As such, I elected to place said logs at the `DEBUG` log level so that users could more easily find the logs from their indexer modules.\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\nCI should pass. You can see the debug logs by appending `RUST_LOG=\"debug\"` to the beginning of `fuel-indexer run`.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n- [Move 'unknown X; check Y' type logs to debug; move stash conn log to

block indexing time, but can't use it in WASM execution cause of https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/408, so decided to use native. \r\n- Noticed that some aspects of native don't work via the plugin\r\n- Just now noticing this cause no one (rightfully so, at this time) uses native execution\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Build `forc-index` locally `cargo build -p forc-index --release`\r\n  - Use this \u261d\ud83c\udffd forc-index when testing\r\n- [ ] Create a native indexer `forc-index new indexer-test --namespace fuel --native && cd indexer-test`\r\n- [ ] Build it `forc-index build --native`\r\n- [ ] Run it `cargo run -- --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80 --run-migrations --manifest indexer_test.manifest.yaml`\r\n  - Yes running via `cargo` is not ideal and not the final state\r\n  - Will update this later (again, no one uses this as of now, but it should still work decently) \r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- fix: update `forc index`'s `--native` indexer creation and usage\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/967/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

Description\r\n\r\nAdd `--replace-indexer` flag which changes how `forc index deploy` works: deployed indexer completely replaces the existing indexer(s) under the same UID. All previous indexer assets, graphql entries, and indexer tables are removed.\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\nI have a simple contract/script/indexer which may be helpful: https://github.com/lostman/fuel-counter\r\n\r\n1. Run `cargo run --features fuel-core-lib -p fuel-indexer -- run --local-fuel-node --replace-indexer`\r\n2. `git clone https://github.com/lostman/fuel-counter`\r\n3. Create an indexer with colliding UID `examples.counter_indexer` that we will replace later:\r\n```\r\nmkdir dummy && cd dummy && forc index new --namespace examples counter_indexer && cd counter_indexer && forc deploy\r\n```\r\n4 Deploy the `counter` contract, an indexer, and run a script to trigger an event: `cd fuel-counter && make`\r\n5. Confirm that the dummy indexer was replaced and that an event was indexed:\r\n```\r\npostgres=> select * from examples_counter_indexer.increntity;\r\n         id          | value |

related entries, and schema tables.\r\n* Remove `forc index revert` and all mentions from the docs.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/962/reactions",

\"Fuel Indexer\" project (right-hand sidebar)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPR does a few things:\r\n  - Updates docs for `forc index status`\r\n  - Fixes bug in the `/status` route where `/health` was placed behind authentication\r\n    - When run on the playground (i.e., on a service using auth) this produced an `InvalidToken` error for every call to `/health`\r\n  - Update authenticated routes\r\n    - Previously we were just checking to see if a user had valid claims\r\n    - Now we're checking if the user has valid claims, _and_ those claims belong to the indexer in question\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] CI should pass\r\n- [ ] Start the service with auth enabled\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80 --verbose --auth-enabled --jwt-secret abcdefg --auth-strategy jwt\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Make a health check request `curl http://localhost:29987/api/health`\r\n  - On `master` this \u261d\ud83c\udffd  would produce an error due to the route being behind auth\r\n\r\n```text\r\n2023-05-27T18:00:35.535251Z  INFO tower_http::trace::on_request: 88: started processing

`ReceiptsRoot`) are exported directly in the plugins `types`\r\n  - We don't allow schema objects to have these \u261d\ud83c\udffd names\r\n  - _Everything_ copied from `fuel_client_schema` is now in the `fuel_indexer_types::fuels` module\r\n    - When we refactor/replace these types, we only have to update one file\r\n    - Namespacing these types under `fuel::` allows users to use these same common names in their GraphQL schema\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Start the service connected to beta-3 using this explorer indexer\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest examples/fuel-explorer/fuel-explorer/fuel_explorer.manifest.yaml --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80 --verbose\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Things should index

Description\r\nAllows for list types to be properly decoded in the schema macro. Note that this does not implement querying for list types, which will come at a later time.\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\nCI should pass as there should be no outward changes just yet. Proper tests will be added to the feature branch at a later time.\r\n\r\n#### Manual Testing\r\nUsing the `hello-indexer` example, ensure that the WASM module builds with no errors for the four possible cases:\r\n\r\n1. Non-nullable list of non-nullable elements (`Vec<FtColumn>`):\r\n- Add the following to the `Salutation` entity in the schema: `words: [Charfield!]!`\r\n- Add the following line to the `Salutation` struct in the handler: `words: vec![\"Hello\".to_string()]`\r\n- Ensure that `cargo build` completes successfully.\r\n\r\n2. Non-nullable list of nullable elements (`Vec<Option<FtColumn>>`):\r\n- Add the following to the `Salutation` entity in the schema: `words: [Charfield]!`\r\n- Add the following line to the `Salutation` struct in the handler: `words: vec![Some(\"Hello\".to_string())]`\r\n- Ensure that `cargo build` completes successfully.\r\n\r\n3. Nullable list of non-nullable elements (`Option<Vec<FtColumn>>`):\r\n- Add the following to the `Salutation` entity in the schema: `words: [Charfield!]`\r\n- Add the following line to the `Salutation` struct in the handler: `words: Some(vec![\"Hello\".to_string()])`\r\n- Ensure that `cargo build` completes successfully.\r\n\r\n4. Nullable list of nullable elements (`Option<Vec<Option<FtColumn>>>`):\r\n- Add the following to the `Salutation` entity in the schema: `words: [Charfield]`\r\n- Add the following line to the `Salutation` struct in the handler: `words: Some(vec![Some(\"Hello\".to_string())])`\r\n- Ensure that `cargo build` completes successfully.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- [Add basic query fragment for

Please add proper labels\r\n- [ ] If there is an issue associated with this PR, please link the issue (right-hand sidebar)\r\n- [ ] If there is not an issue associated with this PR, add this PR to the \"Fuel Indexer\" project (right-hand sidebar)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- PR does a few things:\r\n  - Prevent usage of reserved names in GraphQL schema object names\r\n  - Refactors the fuel-indexer-types module\r\n    - Import structure was spaghetti \ud83c\udf5d \r\n  - Removes namespacing types in codgen\r\n    - We just import the types w/o a namespace, and use the reserved keyword check\r\n  - Adds the initial implementation of `Header`, `Block`, and `Conensus`\r\n    - I've left notes, as this work is a WIP.\r\n      - It cannot be put on a feature branch because master needs some of these changes\r\n  - Removes the `explorer_indexer` example\r\n    - Now that we have our _actual_ explorer, we don't need this\r\n  - Updates tests accordingly\r\n  - Adds custom indexer-specific `HeaderData`, and `Genesis` types\r\n    - We need these until https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/issues/286 is finished\r\n  \r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] CI should pass\r\n- [ ] Rebuild your modules\r\n- [ ] Start the service connected to beta-3 using the fuel-explorer indexer\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest examples/fuel-explorer/fuel-explorer/fuel_explorer.manifest.yaml --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Open your GraphQL playground http://localhost:29987/api/playground/fuel/explorer\r\n- [ ] Query for the initial block data \r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  block {\r\n    block_id\r\n    header {\r\n      block_id\r\n      da_height\r\n      transactions_count\r\n      message_receipt_count\r\n      transactions_root\r\n      message_receipt_root\r\n      height\r\n      prev_root\r\n      timestamp\r\n

\"Fuel Indexer\" project (right-hand sidebar)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- PR adds support for a `@norelation` directive\r\n  - Applying this directive to any field on an object renders the entire object as `NoRelation`, which means the object is stored as `Json`\r\n    - I chose `Json` over `Blob` because I think it might be easier to extract the item into an object\r\n      - This will definitely require a second pass later\r\n- PR also moves some code around (moves `serialize` and `deserialize` from fuel-indexer-schema to fuel-indexer-lib)\r\n- \r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Test was added so CI should pass\r\n- [ ] Build assets `bash scripts/utils/build_test_wasm_module.bash`\r\n- [ ] Start a local fuel node `cargo run -p fuel-node --bin fuel-node`\r\n- [ ] Start the web API `cargo run -p web-api --bin web-api`\r\n- [ ] Start the service with the test indexer \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest packages/fuel-indexer-tests/components/indices/fuel-indexer-test/fuel_indexer_test.yaml --run-migrations\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Trigger some data `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/block`\r\n- [ ] Open your playground `http://localhost:29987/api/playground/fuel_indexer_test/index1`\r\n- [ ] Make the following query:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  usesnotableentity {\r\n    id\r\n    name\r\n    no_table\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Should see your type come back as JSON\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": 1,\r\n      \"name\": \"hello world\",\r\n      \"no_table\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"norelation\",\r\n        \"size\": 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Note that the item `NoRelationEntity` already comes back as an object straight from the DB, so no further deserialization is needed\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- enhancement: add support for a `@norelation` directive that does not create SQL tables for entities\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

implementing Tai64Timestamp might be blocked by https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/issues/970\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Wipe your DB\r\n- [ ] Build your indexers locally\r\n- [ ] Run the service with our test indexer connected beta-3 \r\n```bash\r\ncargo run --bin fuel-indexer -- run --manifest packages/fuel-indexer-tests/components/indices/fuel-indexer-test/fuel_indexer_test.yaml --run-migrations --fuel-node-host beta-3.fuel.network --fuel-node-port 80\r\n```\r\n- [ ] After a few seconds of indexing, open your GraphQL playground `http://localhost:29987/api/playground/fuel_indexer_test/index1`\r\n- [ ] Make a query for an entity with the new fields\r\n\r\n```graph\r\nquery {\r\n  explorerentity {\r\n    id\r\n    hex\r\n    time\r\n    sig\r\n    bytes\r\n    nonce\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- enhancement: add explorer types\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
