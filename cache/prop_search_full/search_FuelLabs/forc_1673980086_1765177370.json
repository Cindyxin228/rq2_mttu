Now uses `cargo metadata` for accurate resolution.\n\n- **Missing dependencies**: Only tracked `fuel-core` and `fuels`, missing crates that use `fuel-core-types`, `fuels-core`, or `fuels-accounts` directly.\n\n- **Unnecessary PRs**: Created empty entries for crates with no tracked dependencies (like forc-tracing), triggering PRs that shouldn't exist. Now skips these entirely.\n\nAlso adds the correct `forc-crypto-0.71.0` release entry.\n\n## Context\n\nSee #125 (forc-tracing release that shouldn't have triggered a releases.toml PR) and #126 (forc-crypto PR that had incomplete dependency info).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/issues/127/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/issues/127/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/issues/124", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/issues/124/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/issues/124/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/issues/124/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc/pull/124", "id": 3704722488, "node_id": "PR_kwDOQT6g8M63l2Mo", "number": 124, "title": "fix: use cargo publish directly instead of publish-crates action", "user": {"login": "JoshuaBatty", "id": 1289413, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyODk0MTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289413?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty", "html_url": "https://github.com/JoshuaBatty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "JoshuaBatty", "id": 1289413, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyODk0MTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289413?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty", "html_url": "https://github.com/JoshuaBatty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "JoshuaBatty", "id": 1289413, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyODk0MTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289413?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty", "html_url": "https://github.com/JoshuaBatty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaBatty/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2025-12-08T05:28:18Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-08T05:33:05Z", "closed_at": "2025-12-08T05:33:04Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FuelLabs/forc/pulls/124", "html_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc/pull/124", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc/pull/124.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc/pull/124.patch", "merged_at": "2025-12-08T05:33:04Z"}, "body": "The FuelLabs/publish-crates action checks all workspace members for consistency even with path parameter.

publish-crates and opens a PR with the updated releases.toml\r\n- Update `RELEASING.md` to document the new compatibility tracking step\r\n\r\nThe script only records dependency versions that the

forc monorepo, continuing the toolchain consolidation effort from [sway-rfcs#49](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-rfcs/pull/49).\n\n## Changes\n\n### New Workspace Members\n- **forc-tracing** - Tracing utility crate (library-only, no binary)\n- **forc-crypto** - Cryptographic utilities CLI tool\n  - Uses path dependency for `forc-tracing` (within monorepo)\n  - Uses crates.io `forc-util` for `cli_examples!` macro\n\n### CI Updates\n- Added binary detection to skip build/strip/upload steps for library-only crates\n- Library crates still publish to crates.io but don't produce release binaries\n\n### Test Fixes\n- Added `serial_test` to prevent race conditions in `forc-tracing` tests\n- Tests share global `JSON_MODE_ACTIVE` state requiring serial execution\n\n## Post-merge Tasks\n- [x] Cut releases: `forc-tracing-0.71.0`, `forc-crypto-0.71.0`\n- [ ] Update fuelup to fetch `forc-crypto` from this repo\n- [x] Update fuel.nix with version routing for `forc-crypto`\n- [x] Update sway-nightly-binaries to build `forc-crypto` from here\n- [ ] Remove `forc-tracing` and `forc-crypto` from sway repo\n\n## Related\n- RFC: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-rfcs/pull/49\n- forc-wallet migration (pattern reference): #1\n- fuelup forc-wallet support: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup/pull/807\n- fuel.nix forc-wallet support: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel.nix/pull/204",

as part of the Fuel toolchain consolidation effort outlined in [sway-rfcs#49](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-rfcs/pull/49).\n\n- Merged complete commit history from `FuelLabs/forc-wallet` (279+ commits)\n- Migrated all 34 version tags with new naming convention: `v0.15.2` \u2192 `forc-wallet-0.15.2`\n- Adopted Tokio-style tagging strategy for monorepo tool versioning\n- Preserved all source code, dependencies, and project structure\n- **Configured generic monorepo release pipeline for independent crate releases**\n\n## Changes\n\n### Repository Structure\n- **Complete git history merge** with `--allow-unrelated-histories`\n- **Tag renaming** following monorepo convention (forc-wallet-0.1.0 through forc-wallet-0.15.2)\n- **Workspace setup** with `forc-wallet` as the first member\n- **rust-toolchain.toml** at repository root (Rust 1.90.0)\n\n### Release Pipeline (Tokio-style)\n- **Generic CI workflow** that automatically detects which crate to release from the tag name\n- **Tag format**: `{crate-name}-{version}` (e.g., `forc-wallet-0.16.0`)\n- **Dual publishing**:\n  - Publishes to crates.io via `FuelLabs/publish-crates` action\n  - Builds cross-platform binaries (Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon)\n- **Tag verification** ensures Cargo.toml version matches the release tag\n- **Documentation** in `RELEASING.md` with complete release process\n\n### Key Features\n- **Future-proof**: Adding new workspace members (e.g., `forc-plugin`) requires zero CI changes\n- **Automatic detection**: CI parses the tag to determine which crate to build/publish\n- **Platform support**: 4 target platforms with stripped, optimized binaries\n- **Artifact naming**: `{crate-name}-{version}-{platform}.tar.gz`\n\n## Post-merge Tasks\n- [x] Migrate 44 open issues from forc-wallet repository\n- [x] Migrate 60 closed issues from forc-wallet repository\n- [x] Migrate all labels\n- [x] Set up monorepo release pipeline\n- [ ] Cut first release (`forc-wallet-0.16.0`) to verify pipeline\n- [ ] Add deprecation notice to original forc-wallet repository\n- [ ] Update documentation and links pointing to old repository\n- [ ] Update fuel.nix, sway-nightly-binaries, and fuelup to use this repo instead of forc-wallet\n\n## Release Instructions\n\nAfter merge, create the first release:\n1. Go to [Releases](../../releases) \u2192 Draft a new release\n2. Enter tag: `forc-wallet-0.16.0`\n3. Add release notes from `forc-wallet/CHANGELOG.md`\n4. Publish release\n\nThe CI will automatically:\n- Publish `forc-wallet` 0.16.0 to crates.io\n- Build and upload binaries for all platforms\n\nSee [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for detailed instructions.\n\n## Related\n- RFC: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-rfcs/pull/49\n- Original repository: https://github.com/FuelLabs/forc-wallet\n- CI pattern inspired by: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Moves forc-wallet into the forc monorepo, adds a workspace and generic tag-based CI/release pipeline with cross-platform binaries and supporting tooling/docs.\n> \n> - **Monorepo & Workspace**:\n>   - Add Rust workspace in `Cargo.toml` with member `forc-wallet`.\n>   - Pin toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml` (Rust `1.90.0`).\n> - **Code Import**:\n>   - Add full `forc-wallet` crate (`forc-wallet/**`) including CLI (`src/main.rs`), library modules, tests, `Cargo.toml` (v`0.16.0`), `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.\n> - **CI/CD**:\n>   - Introduce `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with fmt/clippy/check/test matrix, coverage (`cargo-llvm-cov`), Slack notifications, and release jobs (publish to crates.io, build/strip/upload binaries for Linux x86_64/aarch64 and macOS x86_64/aarch64).\n>   - Add nightly `cargo-audit` and `markdown-lint` workflows.\n>   - Add `scripts/verify_tag.sh` to validate `{crate}-{version}` tags against `Cargo.toml`.\n> - **Releasing & Docs**:\n>   - Add `RELEASING.md` describing Tokio-style tag format `{crate-name}-{version}` and release steps.\n>   - Update root `README.md` and repository configs (`.gitignore`, `.markdownlint.yaml`).\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 6d0715c5b7ddcd5f8e26077562d168aeb1a250c4.
