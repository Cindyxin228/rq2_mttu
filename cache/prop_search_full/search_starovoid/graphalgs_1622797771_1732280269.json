promised](https://github.com/starovoid/graphalgs/issues/2) to implement Johnson's algorithm to find all elementary circuits.\r\n\r\nI did, but the algorithm can be simplified by replacing `if f then ... else ...` with `blocked(v) := false`. The paper claims that this complication improves the performance. I measured the performance of  both versions using random graphs with different node count and edge count. The simpler version was always faster.\r\nI therefore decided to keep the simpler form, but I named it `elementary_circuits` instead of `johnson_elementary_circuits` as it does not have much in common with the original algorithm.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/starovoid/graphalgs/issues/3/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/starovoid/graphalgs/issues/3/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
