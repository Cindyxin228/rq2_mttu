When this feature is used, it will set the `log-always` feature in the tracing crate, so the users of the log library are able to watch errors in the library.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mvniekerk/tokio-cron-scheduler/issues/60/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mvniekerk/tokio-cron-scheduler/issues/60/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
