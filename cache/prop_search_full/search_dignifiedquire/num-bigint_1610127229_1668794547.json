[autocfg panics when building with `-Zbuild-std`][1].\r\n\r\nInstead of panicking when the `i128` feature is requested but\r\n`probe_type(\"i128\")` fails, just go ahead and enable the feature. If\r\n`i128` truly isn't available then compilation will still fail, just\r\nlater on. This is unlikely to be an issue in practice since [`i128`\r\nwas stabilized in Rust 1.26.0][2].\r\n\r\nTested by building with:\r\n\r\n    cargo +nightly build --target=x86_64-unknown-uefi \\\r\n        -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --no-default-features \\\r\n        --features=i128\r\n\r\nI imagine that since the [readme lists compatibility starting with rustc 1.31][3], the `i128` feature could probably be dropped entirely, but I figure this more minimal change is easier.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/cuviper/autocfg/issues/34\r\n[2]:
