Ideally there would be a way to do this in `take_mut` so you didn't need to use an `Option`, but since `take_mut::take_or_recover` is generic it can probably be inlined and the `expect` failure branch can probably be optimised out. A possible optimisation is to unsafely synthesise for ZSTs so that the `Fn(...) -> ()` case can generate code precisely equal to the code before this PR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs/issues/37/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs/issues/37/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
