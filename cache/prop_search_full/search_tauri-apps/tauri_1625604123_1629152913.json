I was thinking that some people might set that true in their shell or profile on their development machine, and may unknowning affect their other Tauri projects. Should we expose some sort of config setting to allow them to set their own env var name to watch? Maybe something on the config like:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  /* ... snip ... */\r\n  \"webdriver\": {\r\n    \"flag\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"MY_APP_AUTOMATION\",\r\n      \"value\": \"true\",\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  /* ... snip ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand maybe we default value the name of the application from cargo env + `_AUTOMATION` with `true` as the value.
