This follows the same pattern as the other events declared as constants too.\r\n- Creates a new enum in `api` for events coming from the backend (`core`) and uses it in the `EventName` type declaration. This makes it easier to find which event to listen to and should hopefully be documented (not sure if Docosorus will automagically pick up on this, I'm unfamiliar with this documentation system). I am also using this new enum across `api` where strings were previously used. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nUpdate \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n<!-- Check at least one.

`as_unknown` for `Either` types\n\nFor the scenario that preserves original JavaScript values in `Either` types and sets them into object property, and retrieves it back in the other place.\n\n```rust\n  #[napi(getter)]\n  pub fn get_fill_style(&self, this: This) -> Result<Unknown> {\n    this.get_named_property_unchecked(FILL_STYLE_HIDDEN_NAME)\n  }\n\n  #[napi(setter, return_if_invalid)]\n  pub fn set_fill_style(\n    &mut self,\n    env: Env,\n    mut this: This,\n    fill_style: Either3<JsString, ClassInstance<CanvasGradient>, ClassInstance<CanvasPattern>>,\n  ) -> Result<()> {\n    // ... some logic\n    let raw_fill_style = fill_style.as_unknown(env);  \n    this.set(FILL_STYLE_HIDDEN_NAME, &raw_fill_style)?;\n    Ok(())\n  }\n```\n\n##### `ToNapiValue` for `f32`\n\nYou can use `f32` as the return type:\n\n```rust\n#[napi]\npub fn return_f32() -> f32 {\n  3.14\n}\n```\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   fix(napi): segfault when `ThreadsafeFunction`'s callback

If not i think we should return the PathBuf directly instead of a Result.\r\n4. Although it started as a fix for the target dir, i changed the logic for the workspace root too, should this be reverted?
