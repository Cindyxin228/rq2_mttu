Currently `target` is a String. By creating a custom type `UpdateTarget { os, arch }` we could constrain the target to valid target combinations only and outright reject unsupported/malformed targets. This would also help to solve #4161.\r\n- **Require `version` field to be strict semver.** Currently we accept both `v1.0.0` and `1.0.0` but only the latter is valid semver (the `semver` crate will reject the former). Requiring strict semver would allow us to get rid of the custom deserialize fn. This would also have the advantage that the `should_update` callback would receive proper `Version` structs instead of `&str` and could perform comparisons much easier (and reliably).\r\n- **Remove name alias**. Currently the version field can be called `version` or `name`. We never have `name` in any docs and it's rather obscure. Getting rid of it would simplify the interface.\r\n- **Add chrono type for `pub_date`**. Currently `pub_date` is a String, and we pass it through as-is. [chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/index.html)::[DateTime](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/compare/refactor/updater-json?expand=1) is ISO 8601 and implements `Deserialize`. This would make updates more secure as malformed dates would be rejected during deseralization as soon as possible.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4162/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4162/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4158", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4158/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4158/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4158/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4158", "id": 1240015562, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC7lts844B4vz", "number": 4158, "title": "feat(ci): update publish-cli workflow", "user": {"login": "lucasfernog", "id": 20051258, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog", "html_url": "https://github.com/lucasfernog", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-05-18T14:02:25Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-22T07:03:34Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-18T14:13:47Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/pulls/4158", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4158", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4158.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4158.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-18T14:13:46Z"}, "body": "<!--\r\nUpdate \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n<!-- Check at least one.

Towards this goal I removed **all** printing functionality from the bundler, cleaning up concerns and bringing the bundler one step closer to being a reusable library.\r\n\r\n### Major new feature\r\n\r\n- The CLI now offers *way* more debug output, logging parameters and outputs of each executed command and shell script plus more. \r\n- The produced output now look much closer to cargo's output (and IMO better than before)\r\n      For this we leverage a custom KV attribute for log macros: `action` that will take the log levels position in the output. `info!(action = \"Bundling\"; \"{}\", app_product_name);` produces `Bundling <App Name>`\r\n- The log level can be controlled via the `--verbose` flag and the `RUST_LOG` env var. (The flag can appear multiple times, where `--verbose` means `Debug` and `--verbose --verbose` means `Trace`)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4060/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4060/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4058", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4058/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4058/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4058/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4058", "id": 1225578341, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC7lts843TRbD", "number": 4058, "title": "feat(core): expose `with_webview` API to access the platform webview", "user": {"login": "lucasfernog", "id": 20051258, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDUxMjU4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20051258?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog", "html_url": "https://github.com/lucasfernog", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasfernog/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-05-04T16:00:46Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-07T18:35:02Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-04T17:14:15Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/tauri/pulls/4058", "html_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4058", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4058.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/4058.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-04T17:14:15Z"}, "body": "<!--\r\nUpdate \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n<!-- Check at least one.

target triple (in a cleaner way than [what I currently found](https://codeutility.org/how-can-i-find-the-current-rust-compilers-default-llvm-target-triple-stack-overflow/)) so that we can no longer depend on an optional value.\r\n\r\nI thought we could use these build-in constants ARCH, OS and FAMILY (from there: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/index.html ), but not sure of their

[#&#8203;431](https://togithub.com/jonasbb/serde_with/issues/431), [#&#8203;436](https://togithub.com/jonasbb/serde_with/issues/436)\n\n    Both types are now compatible with these functions: `maps_duplicate_key_is_error`, `maps_first_key_wins`, `sets_duplicate_value_is_error`, `sets_last_value_wins`.\n    `serde_as` integration is provided by implementing both `SerializeAs` and `DeserializeAs` for both types.\n    `IndexMap`s can also be serialized as a list of types via the `serde_as(as = \"Vec<(_, _)>\")` annotation.\n\n    All implementations are gated behind the `indexmap` feature.\n\n    Thanks to [@&#8203;jgrund](https://togithub.com/jgrund) for providing parts of the implementation.\n\n### [`v1.12.1`](https://togithub.com/jonasbb/serde_with/releases/v1.12.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/jonasbb/serde_with/compare/v1.12.0...v1.12.1)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Depend on a newer `serde_with_macros` version to pull in some fixes.\n    -   Account for generics when deriving implementations with `SerializeDisplay` and `DeserializeFromStr` [#&#8203;413](https://togithub.com/jonasbb/serde_with/issues/413)\n    -   Provide better error messages when parsing types fails [#&#8203;423](https://togithub.com/jonasbb/serde_with/issues/423)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft/tslib</summary>\n\n### [`v2.4.0`](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/tslib/releases/2.4.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/tslib/compare/2.3.1...2.4.0)\n\nThis release includes the `__classPrivateFieldIn` helper as well as an update to `__createBinding` to reduce indirection between multiple re-exports.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: \"after 3am on Wednesday\" (UTC).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
