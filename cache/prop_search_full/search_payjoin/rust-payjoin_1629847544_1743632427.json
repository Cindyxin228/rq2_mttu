This is an opinionated overwrite to make it easier to follow and make the documentation more comprehensive. Feel free to let me know if anything from the old documentation needs keeping or if something I put here doesn't belong.\r\n\r\nIt now also includes a full tutorial for using it, along with configuration instructions and a comprehensive reference of commands. Given the required length of this \"quick start\", it may be better to eventually package the environment setup in a Docker container for easy testing.\r\n\r\nI wrote this by installing the latest version from crates.io as listed in the docs and using that, but since the current release version is incompatible with the payjoin directory in use (as mentioned in #623), I'm blocked on fully verifying the send/receive/resume flows work, and so am putting this in draft. I don't want to rewrite this based on the updates from the source build, however, since then these docs would be inaccurate and wouldn't make sense for anyone who isn't building from source. So I'm happy to leave this in draft until the new release and then update what's missing accordingly. Let me know your feedback!\r\n\r\nNotes on major changes:\r\n- [x] Reference its applicability to Bitcoin Core explicitly in the primary description, since that is the name of the overall software project people are used to hearing. `bitcoind` specifically is also referenced later for clarity.\r\n- [x] I added a phrase about this being the reference implementation for payjoin, both to accurately identify its analogous purpose to `bitcoin-cli` and to add some gravitas.\r\n- [x] A \"Quick Start\" section which is a complete and thorough set of instructions for how to setup an environment to use this from scratch. It uses [nigiri](https://nigiri.vulpem.com) for environment setup, which [fwict](https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=1907183389666587120) is one of the easiest to use to get a quick `bitcoind` regtest instance. People can just follow this (and click on links for concepts they may not know about) and without having to do any extra work.\r\n- [x] \"Configuration\" and \"Reference\" sections.\r\n\r\nA point of confusion and frustration for me with most bitcoin software has always been 1) lots of assumed knowledge and 2) ambiguous and incomplete examples/documentation.

This is at feature parity with the current functionality of payjoin-cli. Persistance is now implemented for both the sender and reciever. We are only persisting when the sender and reciver are first intialized. The trait design is architected in such a way that its easily expandable for other state of the senders and reciever. For example if a application is expecting to save the state at init and finalize and non of the intermediate steps that is an option. And for the reciever I would advocate in a seperate PR that we persist when the reciever when first crated, proposal fetched and payjoin created. \r\n\r\nThere is alot to bikeshed when we consider persisting other reciever & sender states. We'll cross that bridge that when we get there but I will say this design is more friendly towards persisting other states, compared to #560.\r\n\r\nAlternative design of the same functionality: #560

more hierarchical, and support both v1 and v2 specific options in sub-structures, that are not feature gated. also move bitcoind related stuff to its own substructure\r\n>\r\n>  2. out of appconfig, generate helper stuff, again i was focused on a struct representing bitcoind (or more generally wallet) capabilities for payjoin, to avoid needing to impl the `bitcoind` method in the trait impls and to hide the details (e.g. error checking, psbt parsing, etc) from the actual App impls, optimizing readability to correspond high level description of the spec\r\n>\r\n>  3. adding an explicit --prefer-bip-78 or option, or something similar, for payjoin-cli compiled with both. due to the backwards compatibility of bip77 that probably requires more than one flag or something that is not just boolean valued, e.g. as a sender be able to send bip78 only even to a bip77 receiver and even if v2 support is compiled can be useful for e2e testing with a single build\r\n>\r\n\r\nI think we're much closer to @nothingmuch's goal:\r\n\r\n> my goal was making sure both app/v{1,2}.rs kind of give a high level overview of both the protocol and the code, de-emphasizing the details like how to talk to bitcoind and emphasizing its role as a reference implementation for bip 77 specifically.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some network details could still be abstracted away to make this even more clear.

That crate is ancient and has a stable release cadence and conservative MSRV targets (1.63 even with the latest) that we can track.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think the `IntoUrl` interface makes our typestate machines easier to work downstream with for the tradeoff of added complexity in our crate.\r\n\r\nIn order to graduate from DRAFT I'd need new error types for `extract` functions that include an `into_url::Error` encapsulating variant. Before I do that work, I'm seeking a concept ack from @spacebear21 or otherwise a rejection of the idea, presumably on the grounds of too much complexity.\r\n\r\nNote, in payjoin-cli We're still validating URLs in configuration, and using the `url::Url` abstraction in function signatures makes more sense than becoming more loose for testing. \r\n\r\nThe greatest advantage of this change may accrue to downstream FFI users, who I imagine use their native language's Url type and conversion to a stringly type that payjoin-ffi handles using IntoUrl rather than forcing them to use the `payjoin::Url` re-export and error handling.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/520/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/520/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/519", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/519/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/519/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/519/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/519", "id": 2821619179, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHm_Cb86Jir_e", "number": 519, "title": "Cleanup test assertions", "user": {"login": "spacebear21", "id": 144076611, "node_id": "U_kgDOCJZvQw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144076611?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21", "html_url": "https://github.com/spacebear21", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacebear21/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-01-30T19:13:59Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-05T16:14:05Z", "closed_at": "2025-02-05T16:14:05Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pulls/519", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/519", "diff_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/519.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/519.patch", "merged_at": "2025-02-05T16:14:05Z"}, "body": "The first commit aims to fix https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/421 -

We don't have one, which is why there's no conflict, but HandlerError would be the closest thing.\r\n> \r\n> Writing this also made me notice that some Result types are duplicated in a bunch of places, so there is an argument to be made for\r\n>\r\n> db::Result = Result<Vec<u8>, Error>\r\nHandlerResult = Result<Response<BoxBody<Bytes, hyper::Error>>, HandlerError>\r\nThe result types are really getting nitty gritty but I figure it can't hurt to share\r\n\r\nUpdating to `db::Error` made sense, and I had to change `db::Result = Result<Vec<u8>, Error>` to ` Result<T> = anyhow::Result<T, Error>` since `pub async fn new(timeout: Duration, db_host: String) -> RedisResult<Self>` didn't return a `Vec<u8>`\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure about the `HandlerResult` update. In `lib.rs`, there are other functions such as `listen_tcp` and `listen_tcp_with_tls` that don't return a `Result` that can be converted into `Result<Response<BoxBody<Bytes, hyper::Error>>, HandlerError>`, so I didn't add the HandlerResult bit", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/488/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/488/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/485", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/485/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/485/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/485/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/485", "id": 2788527273, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHm_Cb86Hx6-E", "number": 485, "title": "Set `disableoutputsubstitution` to 'true' if used ", "user": {"login": "arminsabouri", "id": 24356537, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzU2NTM3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24356537?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri", "html_url": "https://github.com/arminsabouri", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arminsabouri/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 13, "created_at": "2025-01-15T00:13:08Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-19T00:37:57Z", "closed_at": "2025-01-15T19:45:17Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pulls/485", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/485", "diff_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/485.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/485.patch", "merged_at": "2025-01-15T19:45:17Z"}, "body": "I noticed this when I was writing tests for my new multiparty optional param.

Before they were v1, http response-specific. Reviewers: What do you think about the `Validation` and `External` variant names? (part of #312)\r\n- Second commit roughly separates the modules\r\n- Third commit unifies some variants that lived in module-specific error types but were actually shared\r\n- Fourth commit recognizes unifies v2-module-specific error variant from the remaining RequestError stub\r\n- Fifth commit properly scopes the `crate::receive::Error` variant to its own module, and I think that may resolve #312\r\n\r\nThere are probably too many `impl<From>` for error variants, but I think the straight path forward is addressing the structure first with this PR and then taking a magnifying glass to the way specific variants are handled.\r\n\r\nThis still also leaves `OutputSubstitutionError`, `SelectionError` and `InputContributionError` from producing JSON error responses to cancel a session with a v2 receiver. We're going to need to address that as part of #403. v2 Error variants also improperly produce JSON errors, but I think the way this was done by abusing `fmt::Display` is also an antipattern to fix at the same time that's addressed. I'd like to leave the JSON receiver error fixes to a follow up since what gets revealed is potentially sensitive and we should be reviewing that change with extra scrutiny.\r\n\r\nSee: #312, #392, #403", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/482/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/482/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/479", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/479/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/479/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/479/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/479", "id": 2787006479, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHm_Cb86HspZ3", "number": 479, "title": "Avoid stringly typed arguments in payjoin-cli App trait", "user": {"login": "nothingmuch", "id": 14242, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjQy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14242?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch", "html_url": "https://github.com/nothingmuch", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nothingmuch/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2025-01-14T12:25:31Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-14T17:18:51Z", "closed_at": "2025-01-14T15:56:12Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pulls/479", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/479", "diff_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/479.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/479.patch", "merged_at": "2025-01-14T15:56:12Z"}, "body": "Minor standalone changes from ongoing refactoring work.

Introduce specific SenderBuilder errors\r\n3. make CreateRequestError v2 only since v1 can only make have sender builder errors\r\n4. separate the modules to reduce feature flags\r\n\r\nThis separation is incomplete because I'm still uncertain what to do with send::ValidationError's feature gated variants. Do I make a send::ValidationError and a send::v2::ValidationError separate? How do those get handled in ResponseError? Does ResponseError get split into two versions, or do I just leave a feature gated variant?

It didn't fail before this change and I'm not sure why, it should have.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/443/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/443/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/441", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/441/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/441/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/441/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/441", "id": 2737348301, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHm_Cb86FGF_r", "number": 441, "title": "Propagate errors when retrieving exp parameter", "user": {"login": "shinghim", "id": 25272964, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjcyOTY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25272964?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim", "html_url": "https://github.com/shinghim", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shinghim/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2024-12-13T04:04:55Z", "updated_at": "2024-12-14T17:46:34Z", "closed_at": "2024-12-14T17:46:34Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pulls/441", "html_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/441", "diff_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/441.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/pull/441.patch", "merged_at": "2024-12-14T17:46:34Z"}, "body": "Follow-up on #428 to propagate errors when retrieving the `exp` parameter.
