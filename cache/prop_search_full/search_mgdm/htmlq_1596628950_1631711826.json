Thanks for writing such a great tool. I've added a GitHub action to automatically build the tool for windows, mac, and linux on x86_64; it runs for any tag of the form `v<semver>` (e.g. `v1.0.0`.) Pushing the tag to the repo starts the workflow, which creates a draft release and attaches binaries for each of the platforms and architectures. I've also attached a gif of the process of cutting a release as some added documentation for how it works!\r\n\r\nFixes #6.\r\n\r\n![htmlq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37303/101234745-cbe8bb00-3676-11eb-8506-8d5c11c7d368.gif)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/issues/7/reactions", "total_count": 10, "+1": 10, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/issues/7/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/issues/4", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/issues/4/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/issues/4/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/issues/4/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq/pull/4", "id": 597633835, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDAxNzEwMDE4", "number": 4, "title": "make html not * the default selector", "user": {"login": "carnott-snap", "id": 23408377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDA4Mzc3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23408377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap", "html_url": "https://github.com/carnott-snap", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carnott-snap/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-04-10T00:53:33Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-07T18:02:46Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-07T18:02:46Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mgdm/htmlq/pulls/4", "html_url": "https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq/pull/4", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq/pull/4.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq/pull/4.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-07T18:02:46Z"}, "body": "Currently if you leave off the selector argument the cli breaks.
