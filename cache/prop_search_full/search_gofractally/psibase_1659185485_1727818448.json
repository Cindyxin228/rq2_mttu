PR makes the Sites app the default server for storing/serving UI artifacts, instead of requiring the same `storeSys` boilerplate to be used within every app.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, both the package infra and psibase CLI tool were updated to call `storeSys` on `sites`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I needed to add a Sites plugin to accommodate the Branding app, which was previously calling its own `storeSys` action manually.\r\n\r\nI removed the `storageInterface`, `WebContentRow`, and `serveContent` as interfaces, since they are no longer needed.\r\n\r\n# Docs changes\r\n\r\nI also updated StorageInterface docs, CLI docs, and package support docs.\r\n\r\n# Benefits\r\n\r\n* Simpler to write services: 99% of cases it is unnecessary to add the store/serveContent boilerplate to a service.\r\n* RPC services can now be used exclusively for servicing queries, which makes them read-only and easier to reason about\r\n* Makes upgrades to UI storage/service easier as it is now centralized. For example it should now be fairly trivial to add gzip compression on all artifacts that use the Sites app.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/867/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/867/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/866", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/866/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/866/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/866/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/866", "id": 2548858292, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG1ZJ4858tD25", "number": 866, "title": "Chainmail: patching line of debugging code", "user": {"login": "cool-ant", "id": 80084763, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg0NzYz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80084763?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant", "html_url": "https://github.com/cool-ant", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cool-ant/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 6276242228, "node_id": "LA_kwDOG1ZJ488AAAABdhfbNA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/labels/no-log", "name": "no-log", "color": "B60205", "default": false, "description": "Any issue/pr with this label will automatically be excluded from autogenerated changelog"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-09-25T19:40:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T20:39:46Z", "closed_at": "2024-09-27T14:07:16Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/pulls/866", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/866", "diff_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/866.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/866.patch", "merged_at": "2024-09-27T14:07:16Z"}, "body": "I mistakenly included a debugging line I meant to revert before the PR.

If no user is logged in to an app, and a plugin schedules a transaction for execution, the current behavior will automatically log in \"alice\". This maintains the existing behavior that alice is the sender of all transactions by default, except this PR adds the ability to change the sender by calling `loginTemp` with a different account name.\r\n\r\nLogin is app-specific, meaning if an app calls `accounts:plugin/accounts->loginTemp(\"alice\")` to log alice in, she is only logged in on that particular app. \r\n\r\nThe final `login` function that will replace and obsolete `loginTemp` will spawn a new tab with an oauth-like login flow. But until that exists, we have this temporary function to allow apps to directly log users in.\r\n\r\n# ClientData plugin\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces the `ClientData` plugin, as mentioned in the plugin storage [specification](https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/issues/740).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/799/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/799/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/798", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/798/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/798/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/798/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/798", "id": 2445703725, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG1ZJ4853S__w", "number": 798, "title": "Chainmail app UI", "user": {"login": "brandonfancher", "id": 7911424, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTE0MjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7911424?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher", "html_url": "https://github.com/brandonfancher", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brandonfancher/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5901848626, "node_id": "LA_kwDOG1ZJ488AAAABX8cQMg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/labels/System%20app", "name": "System app", "color": "94AE6C", "default": false, "description": "Related to system services and their apps/plugins"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2024-08-02T20:14:49Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-03T20:19:17Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-03T20:19:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/pulls/798", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/798", "diff_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/798.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/798.patch", "merged_at": "2024-08-03T20:19:15Z"}, "body": "## Special attention for:\r\n- Did I update `CMakeLists.txt` properly?\r\n\r\n## In this PR\r\n- Chain now boots with webmail UI\r\n- Home page lists \"Chain mail\" as an app\r\n- Slight improvements to home layout/responsiveness\r\n- Drafts supported in `localstorage`\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n- 3 hard-coded accounts: `alice`, `bob`, and `webmail`\r\n- `alice` alone can send; all three accounts can receive\r\n- Emails cannot be deleted.

over IndexedDB because it is a synchronous interface. \r\n\r\nIn the future we can migrate to use IndexedDB to increase the amount of storage available for plugins, perhaps once [JSPI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration/blob/main/proposals/js-promise-integration/Overview.md) is more widely available.\r\n\r\n### Exclusions\r\n\r\n* Currently a known bug in the implementation of `list-keys`, so it is currently commented out and unavailable everywhere.\r\n* The increment function is supposed to be atomic, but it is not. It currently just outputs a warning that it is non-atomic.\r\n\r\n### Unit test output\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff81622d-6ec1-4928-bfab-e32f21fc6a88)\r\n",

The new endpoint `http://transact.<ROOT HOST>/push_transaction` has nearly the same interface as the existing `/native/push_transaction`. In particular, it returns a trace as soon as a transaction either fails or is included in a block. Transactions are forwarded between block producers. Non-voting nodes do not forward transactions and submitting a transaction to such a node will likely cause the connection to hang. `/native/push_transaction` remains for now but should be considered deprecated.\r\n\r\nInternals\r\n---\r\n\r\n- `psinode` now calls `transact::nextTransaction` to find a transaction to apply while building a block. \r\n- New callbacks `acceptTransaction` and `rejectTransaction`, receive the transaction id and transaction trace as arguments.\r\n- New intrinsics `socketSend` and `socketAutoClose` to interact with sockets.\r\n- `http-server::serve` now takes an `i32` socket handle and should call `socketSend` with the response instead of returning it.\r\n- Predefined socket that a producer can use to broadcast to all other producers.\r\n- New entry point

I've opted to stop at this point, given my ability to test for non-alice accounts severely restricts the test cases, not to mention we don't have a real front-end for the Identity or Attestation service, and it's needs will become more obvious once we get back to the broader fractally implementation.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/778/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/778/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/775", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/775/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/775/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/775/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/775", "id": 2392724275, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG1ZJ4850i29C", "number": 775, "title": "Deploy token plugin by default", "user": {"login": "James-Mart", "id": 42752296, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzUyMjk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42752296?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart", "html_url": "https://github.com/James-Mart", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/James-Mart/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5901848626, "node_id": "LA_kwDOG1ZJ488AAAABX8cQMg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/labels/System%20app", "name": "System app", "color": "94AE6C", "default": false, "description": "Related to system services and their apps/plugins"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-07-05T14:33:33Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-12T13:51:51Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-12T13:51:39Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/pulls/775", "html_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/775", "diff_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/775.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/gofractally/psibase/pull/775.patch", "merged_at": "2024-07-12T13:51:39Z"}, "body": "I noticed the token app has a plugin, but it's not automatically deployed.

Refactors the SPKI library that was previously coupled to AuthSig/RAuthSig, it is now its own library in the same namespace that can be independently linked\r\n2. Minor improvement to the tester, starting to remove its dependency on the `psibase::PublicKey` type (secp256k1 keys), which is being deprecated.\r\n3. Wraps `AuthSig` and `AuthK1` in their own namespaces, to better isolate functionality that is specific to each auth library.\r\n\r\nAnd there are a few additions also related to auth:\r\n1. Adds some functionality to the AuthSig plugin (The ability to set the key of the caller, and the ability to create and return a new keypair in pem format)\r\n2. Adds a new library (also in AuthSig namespace) for parsing PEM to PrivateKeyInfo. Basically the private key equivalent to the SPKI library, although there's no packing/unpacking logic because it's intended to be used for signing in tests, not as objects that can packed and sent to the node.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gofractally/psibase/issues/735/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,
