So I updated the depend itoa. In 1.0.0 they drop the fmt function. I replaced the code with the equivalent https://docs.rs/itoa/0.4.7/src/itoa/lib.rs.html#90-93 \r\n2. Closes #10 \r\n3. Redid the gen_id function. I did this to make it more easily compatible with the new logo api. \r\n4. Changed the color function in the badge builder to take a generic for Into<Color>. To allow for easier setting of colors. \r\n5. Removed some clippy warnings. \r\nNone of this could should be breaking. \r\n\r\nGen_ID could possible break something. However, I don't see that happening.
