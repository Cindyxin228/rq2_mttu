2019\n> Bugfixes:\n> \n> - fix: add \"no-prototype-builtins\" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7\n> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878\n> \n> Chores / Build:\n> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f\n> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, \n>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0\n> \n> Security:\n> \n> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` \n>   have been added to the list of \"properties that must be enumerable\".\n>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, \n>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...
