I realized while\r\nimplementing more storage back-ends in unFTP that there is no need to\r\nmake the user detail optional in the trait methods. For example in\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync fn list<P: AsRef<Path> + Send + Debug>(&self, user: &User, path: P) -> ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe user was previously optional (i.e. `&Optional<User>`). By the time these methods are called\r\nwe will always have a valid user. Its more that the Session struct stores it as optional and we used it as is. A future refactoring to the Session struct might split it in two, one for a pre-auth session and one for after the user was authenticated. There are some nice ways in Rust to represent different states like this. For now I just fix the storage back-end to make it more ergonomic and correct.\r\n\r\nThe other bundled change is this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2511554/125047038-da7cd200-e09e-11eb-82e8-b411f60d3b60.png)\r\n\r\nwhich is just a fix of a previous oversight.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/373/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/373/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/372", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/372/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/372/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/372/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp/pull/372", "id": 938322334, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg0NzMxMjk4", "number": 372, "title": "Json authenticator support mTLS username/client certificate verification", "user": {"login": "robklg", "id": 8056094, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTYwOTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8056094?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg", "html_url": "https://github.com/robklg", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robklg/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-07-06T23:00:43Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-13T11:40:51Z", "closed_at": "2021-07-13T11:40:50Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/pulls/372", "html_url": "https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp/pull/372", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp/pull/372.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp/pull/372.patch", "merged_at": "2021-07-13T11:40:50Z"}, "body": "https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp/issues/369", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/372/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bolcom/libunftp/issues/372/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
