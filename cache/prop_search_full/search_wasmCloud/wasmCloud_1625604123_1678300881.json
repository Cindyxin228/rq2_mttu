We no longer actively develop our Rust runtime here, but `wasmCloud/wasmCloud` can be a great hub for tracking issues across the org, linking to our relevant sites and documentation, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing, I encourage you to visit https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/docs/readme-homepage to take a look at the changes.\r\n\r\nWhat I've done in this PR:\r\n1. Renamed `deprecated` to `archived` across our docs to better represent our sentiment\r\n2. Added `examples` as a submodule to easily point people to the examples repo\r\n3. Removed the `control-interface` crate folder\r\n4. Updated `CODEOWNERS`\r\n5. Overhauled the README\r\n\r\nSome questions I propose for discussion:\r\n- [x] Do more submodules belong in this repository?\r\n- [x] Does `provider-archive` belong here, or in its own repository in the org\r\n- [ ] Are there any examples of issue templates that we can leverage for this repository? I've considered something like a request to join our slack, documentation requests, tracking breaking changes in large elements of wasmCloud (e.g. `wasmbus-rpc` or a Rust minimum required version)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Once this is merged, change the landscape.cncf.io repository to point here instead.\r\n- [x] Pin this repository instead of `examples` on our organization pinned repos",

place, so it couldn't pull actors from `eu.gcr.io/wasmcloud-k8s-demo/todo-backend:0.2`.\r\nAlpine's libc is also not capable of loading capability provider .so files.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up a kubernetes cluster, we had a few problems connecting to redis and nats, and our http capability provider would sometimes not come up correctly. I have added a `debug` target that includes the utilities needed to debug these things.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking that it would be nice to have a `test` target, that runs some sanity integration checks (spin up a wasmcloud with a manifest and check that it works)\r\n\r\nThis has been pushed to `eu.gcr.io/wasmcloud-k8s-demo/wasmcloud:0.18.2` and `eu.gcr.io/wasmcloud-k8s-demo/wasmcloud:0.18.2-debug` and tested as part of https://github.com/redbadger/wasmcloud-k8s-demo", "reactions": {"url":
