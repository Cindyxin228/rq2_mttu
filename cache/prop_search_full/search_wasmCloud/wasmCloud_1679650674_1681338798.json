Host implementers can use to add additional context onto invocations which will be propagated the entire length of the call.\r\n\r\nThe original problem this addresses is the fact that there was no way to propagate a parent span ID through a system in order to construct a full trace from the host side. I'd be happy to entertain different naming schemes for the context, different API strategies instead of a `call` and `call_with_context` function, etc. I decided to implement first to show a glimpse at what needed to be done so we can discuss.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n## Release Information\r\n`next`\r\n\r\n## Consumer Impact\r\nConsumers of this crate won't need to change their code as the `call_with_context` functions are pure additions.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n<!---\r\nDeclare the testing information for this pull request\r\n--->\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nIdentify the platforms on which this code was built (include both OS and CPU architecture)\r\n--->\r\nBuilt on platform(s)\r\n- [ ] x86_64-linux\r\n- [ ] aarch64-linux\r\n- [ ] x86_64-darwin\r\n- [x] aarch64-darwin\r\n- [ ] x86_64-windows\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nIdentify the platforms on which this code was tested (include both OS and CPU architecture)\r\n--->\r\nTested on platform(s)\r\n- [ ] x86_64-linux\r\n- [ ] aarch64-linux\r\n- [ ] x86_64-darwin\r\n- [x] aarch64-darwin\r\n- [ ] x86_64-windows\r\n\r\n### Unit Test(s)\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Acceptance or Integration\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Manual Verification\r\nI used this git branch in order to test https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp/pull/594 which is a full implementation of adding a `call_context` with a span context and then reconstituting the trace context on the other end\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12040685/228333443-ce00075e-7015-4007-959e-7e1fad5dfcf2.png)\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/298/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/298/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/297", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/297/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/297/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/297/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/297", "id": 1644237298, "node_id": "PR_kwDOEiTU7M5NFZIS", "number": 297, "title": "ci: rework", "user": {"login": "rvolosatovs", "id": 12877905, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyODc3OTA1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12877905?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs", "html_url": "https://github.com/rvolosatovs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rvolosatovs/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-03-28T15:51:09Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-31T13:27:25Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-31T12:54:57Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pulls/297", "html_url": "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/297", "diff_url": "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/297.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/297.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-31T12:54:57Z"}, "body": "- Update https://github.com/rvolosatovs/nixify, which now has support for cross-compilation to win64 and static armv7 targets (disabled for now, win64 will be done in #295 )\r\n- Configure Nix caches within the flake\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n<!--- \r\nLink to any issues or correlated pull requests that are related to this PR.
