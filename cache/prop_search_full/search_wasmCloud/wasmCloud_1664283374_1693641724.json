This is ignored during formatting, but is used to indicate\nthe end of input when parsing. If any input remains after this component, an error is returned.\nThis is useful when using the <code>[first]</code> component, as it avoids the need to reorder variants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The exemption for MacOS introduced in 0.3.20 has been removed. This is because some supported\nversions of MacOS do not meet the requirements for the exemption.</li>\n<li>The <code>UnexpectedTrailingCharacters</code> error variant has been moved to <code>ParseFromDescription</code>.

need to do full table scans of the bucket\r\n  - Note: awkward typing of wascap's `jwt::Claims` makes it difficult to unify these right now\r\n- adds a `PolicyManager`, which:\r\n  - makes requests on `WASMCLOUD_POLICY_TOPIC` when starting an actor/provider or when an actor receives an invocation\r\n    - caches decisions made, so (in general) only one request is needed\r\n  - listens on

the host\r\n- sets up tracing for the host\r\n- proxies OTEL config values to providers via `HostData`\r\n- uses a strongly-typed `HostData` in the host to pass data to providers\r\n- adds a `core` crate for types shared across the wasmCloud ecosystem (primarily between host and provider)\r\n- adds a `tracing` crate for setting up tracing and extracting/injecting trace context on invocations (this code was migrated from the provider SDK)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\nResolves https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/568\r\nResolves

This PR also preserves the OTP behavior which avoids spammy health check updates by only publishing a health check event if the status changes. \r\n\r\nI also refactored the `publish_event` functionality to be inside of the `events` module as an alternate way to publish an event, given a `ctl_nats` and `eventbuilder` as arguments. This is useful because the closure that monitors provider health checks (and will exit once the provider stops) doesn't really need a full clone of the host object, and instead we can pass a cheaply cloned eventbuilder + ctl_nats client.\r\n\r\nI found this by testing wadm and realizing that wadm essentially relies on health checks to know that a provider is healthy and ready for a link definition.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\nRequires https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/pull/164 to \"fully\" support applications\r\n\r\n## Release Information\r\n<!---\r\nClearly state the target release for this code.

Additionally, it adds support for the control interface topic prefix, which just defaults to `wasmbus.ctl` as before.\r\n\r\nI made a few choices + stances in this PR:\r\n1. RPC, CTL, and provider RPC connection arguments are _advanced_ arguments. Therefore, they are hidden by default. (I would support showing these arguments with some kind of --help --advanced flag)\r\n2. RPC, CTL, and provider RPC connection args should fall back on the supplied NATS connection variables if not provided, instead of maintaining a separate all-around NATS connection. This way we're always internally using the correct connection, even if it's using the same parameters.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\nFixes #478 \r\n\r\n## Release Information\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Consumer Impact\r\n<!---\r\nIndicate the impact, if any, this change will have on other consumers, dependencies, or dependents.

Specifically, this PR implements using:\r\n1. `cluster_issuers` list by propagating the list as a part of host config. Will need to be utilized in #483 \r\n2. `log_level` by parsing as a `tracing::Level` and passing to the `tracing_subscriber` setup\r\n3. `provider_shutdown_delay` by adding a NATS request to gracefully shutdown the provider with this timeout\r\n4. `allow_latest`, `allowed_insecure`, `oci_registry`, `oci_user`, and `oci_password` by adding an `OciOpts` struct that the `Host` holds as a field and will use for all OCI operations\r\n5. `js_domain` by using the optional domain to create the Jetstream context when accessing the LATTICECACHE KV bucket.\r\n\r\nThere are still more args to implement, but I'm trying to keep the PRs more organized and only add a few features at a time.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Release Information\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Consumer
