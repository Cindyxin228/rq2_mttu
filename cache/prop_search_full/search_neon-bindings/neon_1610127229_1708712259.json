Deleted the deadcode.\r\n* Left with useless feature flags for `napi-1`. Remove these.\r\n* After removing feature flags, lots of `use` statements were unnecessarily complicated. Cleaned all of the `use` statements for consistent style.\r\n* Cleaned up tests, feature flags and aliases\r\n* Moved `neon-runtime` to `neon::sys`. There isn't a reason for it to be a separate crate anymore and this will yield better performance with thin LTO.\r\n* Removed other unused components: `neon-build`, `cli`\r\n\r\nThere are a few future clean-ups I would like to perform that are not included. For example:\r\n* Re-organize repo. crates only has one crate now. Move `src` into `crates/neon`. Create `npm` directory (name?) move `create-neon` and `cargo-cp-artifact` into it.\r\n* Update `neon::sys` (formerly `neon-runtime`) methods to be more idiomatic instead of the style of legacy. This is removing a lot of out pointers.

These features all have accepted RFCs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, feature flags that are *only* used for the `legacy` backend are commented as deprecated. This will serve as a note to remove when removing the `legacy` backend.\r\n\r\n## Alternative\r\n\r\nThis PR *completely* removes the feature flags. This is a breaking change that will require users to remove the feature flag when upgrading.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Neon could only remove *usages* of the feature flag, but keep the flag in `Cargo.toml` for backwards compatibility, deferring the breaking change to a later release.\r\n\r\n## Follow-up\r\n\r\nThe `enable-static-tests` feature flag should also be removed.

threadsafe function or task callback crashes the process with the default handler. This PR proposes that Neon trigger an `unhandledRejection` instead which avoids the bug.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nOn recent versions of Node, this has the same intended consequence: the error is logged and the process terminates uncleanly. However, on older versions of Node, the rejection will only be logged.\r\n\r\n## Why wasn't this caught?\r\n\r\nWhile investigating the issue, I was curious why we didn't see it in unit tests. It appears that the internal code in the default exception handler is *necessary* for the bug. Since our tests replace this code, the bug never happens. The same would be true for any exception handler a user could write since it only uses internal/private APIs. This makes me wonder if the C++ crash is acceptable.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nIt's strange to trigger an `unhandledRejection` for something that is unrelated to Promises. In the future, we may change this back to `uncaughtException`. However, in order to avoid a breaking change:\r\n\r\n1. Add a feature flag that causes `uncaughtException` instead of `unhandledRejection`\r\n2. Make the feature flag default in `create-neon` so that all new projects use it\r\n3. Consider changing the default feature flag for everyone\r\n\r\nWe may choose to take a stance that it *shouldn't* impact many people and even though it's _technically_ a breaking change, the impact should be light and _could_ be considered a bug fix. In that case, we would make a feature flag to restore the original behavior and push out the change with only a minor revision.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/854/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/854/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/852", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/852/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/852/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/852/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/852", "id": 1132766174, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAoyP184yiCj-", "number": 852, "title": "Add an NPM workspace and use prettier for non-rust source files", "user": {"login": "kjvalencik", "id": 2471970, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzE5NzA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2471970?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik", "html_url": "https://github.com/kjvalencik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-02-11T15:37:40Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-19T14:35:53Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-19T14:35:52Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/pulls/852", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/852", "diff_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/852.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/852.patch", "merged_at": "2022-02-19T14:35:52Z"}, "body": "*Tip for reviewing*: Review the individual commits instead of the PR.

They are both `Send` and `Sync` to allow holding references across Rust threads. However, the current implementation has a soundness hole.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/843\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using [Node worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html), there may be multiple JavaScript runtimes present in the process. As shown in https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/843, it is possible to use a `Root` with a `Context` from the wrong runtime and cause a crash/undefined behavior.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the issue by panicking when attempting to dereference from the wrong module instance. In the future, we may want to add `try_` variants to the `Root` methods to allow error handling without a `panic`. However, in most cases, this will be a logic error that applications cannot recover.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nOn Node-API 6+, we use [instance data](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#environment-life-cycle-apis) to store a unique identifier initialized from a global counter. Each `Root` stores the identifier for comparing later when being used.\r\n\r\nOn previous versions, the [`ThreadId`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.ThreadId.html) is used. This may not be as robust and is sensitive to V8 implementation details.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/847/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":

These types depend on being contained in a `Handle` to verify the lifetime. They should only exist as references outside of a `Handle`. Unfortunately, the ability to clone allows getting an owned copy from a reference.\r\n\r\nThis change attempts to minimize impact to users by making `Handle<T>` `Copy`, while making the inner `T` `!Copy`. This works by introducing a new marker trait `TransparentWrapper` which indicates a type is a transparent wrapper around a `TransparentWrapper::Inner` type--allowing transmutation between the two.\r\n\r\nUsing this `trait`, `Handle` actually stores a `Copy` inner type, while implementing `Deref` with a `Target` to the `!Copy` outer type.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since `Copy` won't propagate upward from a `Deref`, all APIs that currently take `self` on a `Value` were changed to take `&self` to keep from requiring a manual `clone()`.

It works very similar to the current functions except the trampoline function is generic.\r\n\r\nDropping the Rust closure requires [`napi_add_finalizer`](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_napi_add_finalizer) which was added in Node-API 5. For this reason, when using older Node-API versions, only `fn` instead of `Fn` are accepted.\r\n\r\n## Future Expansion\r\n\r\nIt would be unsound to accept `FnMut` because a function may be reentrant. A function could trivially accept a reference to itself and then call that function. However, it is very cumbersome to use `RefCell` to get access to mutable state.\r\n\r\nSince most functions will *not* have any possibility for reentrancy and since closure lifetime inference is very limited in Rust, it would be useful for Neon to provide a `JsFunction::new_mut` that accepts an `FnMut` and wraps it in a `RefCell`.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/811/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/811/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/808", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/808/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/808/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/808/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/808", "id": 1012570222, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAoyP184shm5j", "number": 808, "title": "fix(neon): Fix undefined behavior in channel callbacks when there is a panic", "user": {"login": "kjvalencik", "id": 2471970, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzE5NzA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2471970?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik", "html_url": "https://github.com/kjvalencik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kjvalencik/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-09-30T20:01:10Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-04T22:22:08Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-04T22:22:08Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/pulls/808", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/808", "diff_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/808.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/808.patch", "merged_at": "2021-10-04T22:22:08Z"}, "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\n* Catches panics and converts to uncaughtException\r\n* Throws uncaughtException if throwing\r\n* Passes opaque exceptions through as JsBox\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n* Return `Err(Throw)` in `Channel::send` no longer *disappears*.

We already have safety mechanisms in place in case of forged `Throw` tokens, leading to well-defined panics (as opposed to something unsafe, like undefined behavior). But this should help prevent programs from _accidentally_ saving and reusing a `Throw` token.\r\n\r\nThere is also a test case that still does show how it's technically possible to forge a token, and demonstrates that it still has predictable behavior.\r\n\r\nAn alternative that would be even safer would be to place a lifetime on a `Throw` token, making it impossible to store them in long-lived storage. But this would leak into the type signatures of e.g. `NeonResult` and APIs that use it, which would add a lot of complexity to Neon for little value. The panic is for a rare enough case that the extra type safety wouldn't be worth it IMO.\r\n\r\nOne more change I want to make in this PR is to add `!Send` phantom data to the `Throw` type so that it can't be shared outside of its thread.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/797/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/797/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/794", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/794/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/794/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/issues/794/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/794", "id": 999741553, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAoyP184r6QY8", "number": 794, "title": "Remove unused cslice dependency", "user": {"login": "complexspaces", "id": 68570223, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTcwMjIz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68570223?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces", "html_url": "https://github.com/complexspaces", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/complexspaces/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-09-17T21:43:42Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-17T21:57:14Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-17T21:54:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/neon-bindings/neon/pulls/794", "html_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/794", "diff_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/794.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/794.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-17T21:54:43Z"}, "body": "This dependency appears to be leftover from a very old version of the Neon project.
