Size of numbers was computed by using stdlib `.len()`, but the thousand separator is non ASCII for some languages (e.g., French or Swedish, which both uses U+202F). This problem was present except when the size was between 1000 and 1024 bytes because then it would use another code path with a plain `.to_string()`, which was obviously wrong as well.\r\n\r\nJust for fun I found where the comment about how \u00abit\u2019s guaranteed to be ASCII\u00bb has been introduced: 4c2bf2f2e6231c14a8aa44cb49c828034c342a69.

455k.\r\n\r\nThis was due to the fact that when the size of the file in the appropriate base (k, M, etc.) was superior to 10, exa stopped displaying the first decimal and formatted the number as an int by casting the float, which in practice was the same thing as if it took the floor of the size. Now, exa uses the same code path that does that the round case, except that it tells the library it uses to use 0 decimals in this particular case.", "reactions": {"url":
