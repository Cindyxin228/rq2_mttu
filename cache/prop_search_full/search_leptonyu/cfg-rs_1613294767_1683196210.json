Both of them will combined close over 40 existing issues and PRs.\n\nThis first release, despite its size, essentially represent preparatory work\nfor the second release, which will be even bigger. Namely, this release:\n\n-   Increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.0, which was released about 1 year ago.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `aho-corasick` to the recently release 1.0\n    version.\n-   Upgrades its dependency on `regex-syntax` to the simultaneously released\n    `0.7` version. The changes to `regex-syntax` principally revolve around a\n    rewrite of its literal extraction code and a number of simplifications and\n    optimizations to its high-level intermediate representation (HIR).\n\nThe second release, which will follow ~shortly after the release above, will\ncontain a soup-to-nuts rewrite of every regex engine. This will be done by\nbringing [`regex-automata`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/regex-automata) into\nthis repository, and then changing the `regex` crate to be nothing but an API\nshim layer on top of `regex-automata`'s API.\n\nThese tandem releases are the culmination of about 3\nyears of on-and-off work that [began in earnest in March\n2020](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656).\n\nBecause of the scale of changes involved in these releases, I would love to\nhear about your experience. Especially if you notice undocumented changes in\nbehavior or performance changes (positive *or* negative).\n\nMost changes in the first release are listed below. For more details, please\nsee the commit log, which reflects a linear and decently documented history\nof all changes.\n\nNew features:\n\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;501](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/501):\n    Permit many more characters to be escaped, even if they have no significance.\n    More specifically, any ASCII character except for `[0-9A-Za-z<>]` can now be\n    escaped. Also, a new routine, `is_escapeable_character`, has been added to\n    `regex-syntax` to query whether a character is escapeable or not.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;547](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/547):\n    Add `Regex::captures_at`. This filles a hole in the API, but doesn't otherwise\n    introduce any new expressive power.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;595](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/595):\n    Capture group names are now Unicode-aware. They can now begin with either a `_`\n    or any \"alphabetic\" codepoint. After the first codepoint, subsequent codepoints\n    can be any sequence of alpha-numeric codepoints, along with `_`, `.`, `[` and\n    `]`. Note that replacement syntax has not changed.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/810):\n    Add `Match::is_empty` and `Match::len` APIs.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/905):\n    Add an `impl Default for RegexSet`, with the default being the empty set.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;908](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/908):\n    A new method, `Regex::static_captures_len`, has been added which returns the\n    number of capture groups in the pattern if and only if every possible match\n    always contains the same number of matching groups.\n-   [FEATURE #&#8203;955](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/955):\n    Named captures can now be written as `(?<name>re)` in addition to\n    `(?P<name>re)`.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now supports empty character classes.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has an optional `std` feature. (This will come\n    to `regex` in the second release.)\n-   FEATURE: The `Hir` type in `regex-syntax` has had a number of simplifications\n    made to it.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` has support for a new `R` flag for enabling CRLF\n    mode. This will be supported in `regex` proper in the second release.\n-   FEATURE: `regex-syntax` now has proper support for \"regex that never\n    matches\" via `Hir::fail()`.\n-   FEATURE: The `hir::literal` module of `regex-syntax` has been completely\n    re-worked. It now has more documentation, examples and advice.\n-   FEATURE: The `allow_invalid_utf8` option in `regex-syntax` has been renamed\n    to `utf8`, and the meaning of the boolean has been flipped.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\n-   PERF: The upgrade to `aho-corasick 1.0` may improve performance in some\n    cases. It's difficult to characterize exactly which patterns this might impact,\n    but if there are a small number of longish (>= 4 bytes) prefix literals, then\n    it might be faster than before.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n-   [BUG #&#8203;514](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/514):\n    Improve `Debug` impl for `Match` so that it doesn't show the entire haystack.\n-   BUGS [#&#8203;516](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/516),\n    [#&#8203;731](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/731):\n    Fix a number of issues with printing `Hir` values as regex patterns.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;610](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/610):\n    Add explicit example of `foo|bar` in the regex syntax docs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;625](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/625):\n    Clarify that `SetMatches::len` does not (regretably) refer to the number of\n    matches in the set.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;660](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/660):\n    Clarify \"verbose mode\" in regex syntax documentation.\n-   BUG [#&#8203;738](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/738),\n    [#&#8203;950](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/950):\n    Fix `CaptureLocations::get` so that it never panics.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;747](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/747):\n    Clarify documentation for `Regex::shortest_match`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;835](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/835):\n    Fix `\\p{Sc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Currency_Symbol}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;846](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/846):\n    Add more clarifying documentation to the `CompiledTooBig` error variant.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;854](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/854):\n    Clarify that `regex::Regex` searches as if the haystack is a sequence of\n    Unicode scalar values.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;884](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/884):\n    Replace `__Nonexhaustive` variants with `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;893](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/893):\n    Optimize case folding since it can get quite slow in some pathological cases.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;895](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/895):\n    Reject `(?-u:\\W)` in `regex::Regex` APIs.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;942](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/942):\n    Add a missing `void` keyword to indicate \"no parameters\" in C API.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;965](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/965):\n    Fix `\\p{Lc}` so that it is equivalent to `\\p{Cased_Letter}`.\n-   [BUG #&#8203;975](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/975):\n    Clarify documentation for `\\pX` syntax.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

{\n    \"foo\" => array![1, 2, json::Null],\n    \"bar\" => 42\n};\n```\n\nYou can now write:\n\n```rust\nlet obj = object! {\n    foo: [1, 2, null],\n    bar: 42\n};\n```\n\n### [`v0.12.2`](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/releases/tag/v0.12.2): 0.12.2\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/compare/v0.12.1...v0.12.2)\n\n-   Fixes [#&#8203;152](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/issues/152) & [#&#8203;153](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/issues/153).\n-   Fixed a whole bunch of warnings and some formatting.\n\n### [`v0.12.1`](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/releases/tag/v0.12.1): 0.12.1\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1)\n\n-   Fixes panics in string generation ([#&#8203;168](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/issues/168)).\n-   Fixes an old link to documentation in doc comments ([#&#8203;170](https://togithub.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust/issues/170)).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) ([source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)) | dev-dependencies | minor | `>= 0.3` -> `>= 0.4.0` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bheisler/criterion.rs</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040---2022-09-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.6...0.4.0)\n\n##### Removed\n\n-   The `Criterion::can_plot` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench_functions` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench` function has been removed.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   HTML report hidden behind non-default feature flag: 'html_reports'\n-   Standalone support (ie without cargo-criterion) feature flag: 'cargo_bench_support'\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.57\n-   `rayon` and `plotters` are optional (and default) dependencies.\n-   Status messages ('warming up', 'analyzing', etc) are printed to stderr, benchmark results are printed to stdout.\n-   Accept subsecond durations for `--warm-up-time`, `--measurement-time` and `--profile-time`.\n-   Replaced serde_cbor with ciborium because the former is no longer maintained.\n-   Upgrade clap to v3 and regex to v1.5.\n\n##### Added\n\n-   A `--discard-baseline` flag for discarding rather than saving benchmark results.\n-   Formal support for benchmarking code compiled to web-assembly.\n-   A `--quiet` flag for printing just a single line per benchmark.\n-   A `Throughput::BytesDecimal` option for measuring throughput in bytes but printing them using\n    decimal units like kilobytes instead of binary units like kibibytes.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   When using `bench_with_input`, the input parameter will now be passed through `black_box` before\n    passing it to the benchmark.\n\n### [`v0.3.6`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;036---2022-07-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.5...0.3.6)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.49\n-   Symbol for microseconds changed from ASCII 'us' to unicode '\u00b5s'\n-   Documentation fixes\n-   Clippy fixes\n\n### [`v0.3.5`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;035---2021-07-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.4...0.3.5)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Corrected `Criterion.toml` in the book.\n-   Corrected configuration typo in the book.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   Bump plotters dependency to always include a bug-fix.\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.46.\n\n### [`v0.3.4`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;034---2021-01-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.3...0.3.4)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added support for benchmarking async functions\n-   Added `with_output_color` for enabling or disabling CLI output coloring programmatically.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Criterion.rs will now give a clear error message in case of benchmarks that take zero time.\n-   Added some extra code to ensure that every sample has at least one iteration.\n-   Added a notice to the `--help` output regarding \"unrecognized option\" errors.\n-   Increased opacity on violin charts.\n-   Fixed violin chart X axis not starting at zero in the plotters backend.\n-   Criterion.rs will now automatically detect the right output directory.\n\n##### Deprecated\n\n-   `Criterion::can_plot` is no longer useful and is deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0.\n-   `Benchmark` and `ParameterizedBenchmark` were already hidden from documentation, but are now\n    formally deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0. Callers should use `BenchmarkGroup` instead.\n-   `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs`, `Criterion::bench_functions`, and `Criterion::bench` were\n    already hidden from documentation, but are now formally deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0.\n    Callers should use `BenchmarkGroup` instead.\n-   Three new optional features have been added; \"html_reports\", \"csv_output\" and\n    \"cargo_bench_support\". These features currently do nothing except disable a warning message at\n    runtime, but in version 0.4.0 they will be used to enable HTML report generation, CSV file\n    generation, and the ability to run in cargo-bench (as opposed to [cargo-criterion]).\n    \"cargo_bench_support\" is enabled by default, but \"html_reports\" and \"csv_output\"\n    are not. If you use Criterion.rs' HTML reports, it is recommended to switch to [cargo-criterion].\n    If you use CSV output, it is recommended to switch to [cargo-criterion] and use the\n    `--message-format=json` option for machine-readable output instead. A warning message will be\n    printed at the start of benchmark runs which do not have \"html_reports\" or \"cargo_bench_support\"\n    enabled, but because CSV output is not widely used it has no warning.\n\n[cargo-criterion]: https://togithub.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion\n\n### [`v0.3.3`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;033---2020-06-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.2...0.3.3)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `CRITERION_HOME` environment variable to set the directory for Criterion to store\n    its results and charts in.\n-   Added support for \\[cargo-criterion]. The long-term goal here is to remove code from Criterion-rs\n    itself to improve compile times, as well as to add features to `cargo-criterion` that are\n    difficult to implement in Criterion-rs.\n-   Add sampling mode option for benchmarks. This allows the user to change how Criterion.rs chooses\n    the iteration counts in each sample. By default, nothing will change for most benchmarks, but\n    very slow benchmarks will now run fewer iterations to fit in the desired number of samples.\n    This affects the statistics and plots generated.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The serialization format for some of the files has changed. This may cause your first benchmark\n    run after updating to produce errors, but they're harmless and will go away after running the\n    benchmarks once.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed a bug where the current measurement was not shown on the relative regression plot.\n-   Fixed rare panic in the plotters backend.\n-   Panic with a clear error message (rather than panicking messily later on) when the user sets the\n    group or function name to the empty string.\n-   Escape single quotes in benchmark names when generating Gnuplot scripts.\n\n### [`v0.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;032---2020-04-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.1...0.3.2)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `?Sized` bound to benchmark parameter types, which allows dynamically sized types like\n    `&str` and `&[T]` to be used as benchmark parameters.\n-   Added the `--output-format <format>` command-line option. If `--output-format bencher` is passed,\n    Criterion.rs will print its measurements in a format similar to that used by the `bencher` crate\n    or unstable `libtest` benchmarks, and using similar statistical measurements as well. Though this\n    provides less information than the default format, it may be useful for supporting tools which\n    parse this output format.\n-   Added `--nocapture` argument. This argument does nothing, but prevents Criterion.rs from exiting\n    when running tests or benchmarks and allowing stdout output from other tests.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed panic when environment variables contains non-UTF8 characters.\n-   Fixed panic when `CRITERION_DEBUG` or `CRITERION_TARGET_DIR` environment variables contain\n    non-UTF8 characters.\n\n### [`v0.3.1`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;031---2020-01-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added new plotting backend using the `plotters` crate. Implementation generously provided by Hao\n    Hou, author of the `plotters` crate.\n-   Added `--plotting-backend` command-line option to select the plotting backend. The existing\n    gnuplot backend will be used by default when available, and the plotters backend will be used when\n    gnuplot is not available or when requested.\n-   Added `Criterion::plotting_backend()` function to configure the plotting backend in code.\n-   Added `--load-baseline` command-line option to load a baseline for comparison\n    rather than measuring the current code\n-   Benchmark filters can now be regular expressions.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed `fibonacci` functions.\n-   Fixed `#[criterion]` benchmarks ignoring the command-line options.\n-   Fixed incorrect scaling of the violin plots.\n-   Don't print the recommended sample count if it's the same as the configured\n    sample count.\n-   Fix potential panic when `nresamples` is set too low. Also added a warning\n    against setting `nresamples` too low.\n-   Fixed issue where a slow outer closure would cause Criterion.rs to calculate\n    the wrong estimated time and number of iterations in the warm-up phase.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) ([source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)) | dev-dependencies | minor | `0.3` -> `0.4` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bheisler/criterion.rs</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040---2022-09-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.6...0.4.0)\n\n##### Removed\n\n-   The `Criterion::can_plot` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench_functions` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench` function has been removed.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   HTML report hidden behind non-default feature flag: 'html_reports'\n-   Standalone support (ie without cargo-criterion) feature flag: 'cargo_bench_support'\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.57\n-   `rayon` and `plotters` are optional (and default) dependencies.\n-   Status messages ('warming up', 'analyzing', etc) are printed to stderr, benchmark results are printed to stdout.\n-   Accept subsecond durations for `--warm-up-time`, `--measurement-time` and `--profile-time`.\n-   Replaced serde_cbor with ciborium because the former is no longer maintained.\n-   Upgrade clap to v3 and regex to v1.5.\n\n##### Added\n\n-   A `--discard-baseline` flag for discarding rather than saving benchmark results.\n-   Formal support for benchmarking code compiled to web-assembly.\n-   A `--quiet` flag for printing just a single line per benchmark.\n-   A `Throughput::BytesDecimal` option for measuring throughput in bytes but printing them using\n    decimal units like kilobytes instead of binary units like kibibytes.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   When using `bench_with_input`, the input parameter will now be passed through `black_box` before\n    passing it to the benchmark.\n\n### [`v0.3.6`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;036---2022-07-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.5...0.3.6)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.49\n-   Symbol for microseconds changed from ASCII 'us' to unicode '\u00b5s'\n-   Documentation fixes\n-   Clippy fixes\n\n### [`v0.3.5`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;035---2021-07-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.4...0.3.5)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Corrected `Criterion.toml` in the book.\n-   Corrected configuration typo in the book.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   Bump plotters dependency to always include a bug-fix.\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.46.\n\n### [`v0.3.4`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;034---2021-01-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.3...0.3.4)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added support for benchmarking async functions\n-   Added `with_output_color` for enabling or disabling CLI output coloring programmatically.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Criterion.rs will now give a clear error message in case of benchmarks that take zero time.\n-   Added some extra code to ensure that every sample has at least one iteration.\n-   Added a notice to the `--help` output regarding \"unrecognized option\" errors.\n-   Increased opacity on violin charts.\n-   Fixed violin chart X axis not starting at zero in the plotters backend.\n-   Criterion.rs will now automatically detect the right output directory.\n\n##### Deprecated\n\n-   `Criterion::can_plot` is no longer useful and is deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0.\n-   `Benchmark` and `ParameterizedBenchmark` were already hidden from documentation, but are now\n    formally deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0. Callers should use `BenchmarkGroup` instead.\n-   `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs`, `Criterion::bench_functions`, and `Criterion::bench` were\n    already hidden from documentation, but are now formally deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0.\n    Callers should use `BenchmarkGroup` instead.\n-   Three new optional features have been added; \"html_reports\", \"csv_output\" and\n    \"cargo_bench_support\". These features currently do nothing except disable a warning message at\n    runtime, but in version 0.4.0 they will be used to enable HTML report generation, CSV file\n    generation, and the ability to run in cargo-bench (as opposed to [cargo-criterion]).\n    \"cargo_bench_support\" is enabled by default, but \"html_reports\" and \"csv_output\"\n    are not. If you use Criterion.rs' HTML reports, it is recommended to switch to [cargo-criterion].\n    If you use CSV output, it is recommended to switch to [cargo-criterion] and use the\n    `--message-format=json` option for machine-readable output instead. A warning message will be\n    printed at the start of benchmark runs which do not have \"html_reports\" or \"cargo_bench_support\"\n    enabled, but because CSV output is not widely used it has no warning.\n\n[cargo-criterion]: https://togithub.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion\n\n### [`v0.3.3`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;033---2020-06-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.2...0.3.3)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `CRITERION_HOME` environment variable to set the directory for Criterion to store\n    its results and charts in.\n-   Added support for \\[cargo-criterion]. The long-term goal here is to remove code from Criterion-rs\n    itself to improve compile times, as well as to add features to `cargo-criterion` that are\n    difficult to implement in Criterion-rs.\n-   Add sampling mode option for benchmarks. This allows the user to change how Criterion.rs chooses\n    the iteration counts in each sample. By default, nothing will change for most benchmarks, but\n    very slow benchmarks will now run fewer iterations to fit in the desired number of samples.\n    This affects the statistics and plots generated.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The serialization format for some of the files has changed. This may cause your first benchmark\n    run after updating to produce errors, but they're harmless and will go away after running the\n    benchmarks once.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed a bug where the current measurement was not shown on the relative regression plot.\n-   Fixed rare panic in the plotters backend.\n-   Panic with a clear error message (rather than panicking messily later on) when the user sets the\n    group or function name to the empty string.\n-   Escape single quotes in benchmark names when generating Gnuplot scripts.\n\n### [`v0.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;032---2020-04-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.1...0.3.2)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `?Sized` bound to benchmark parameter types, which allows dynamically sized types like\n    `&str` and `&[T]` to be used as benchmark parameters.\n-   Added the `--output-format <format>` command-line option. If `--output-format bencher` is passed,\n    Criterion.rs will print its measurements in a format similar to that used by the `bencher` crate\n    or unstable `libtest` benchmarks, and using similar statistical measurements as well. Though this\n    provides less information than the default format, it may be useful for supporting tools which\n    parse this output format.\n-   Added `--nocapture` argument. This argument does nothing, but prevents Criterion.rs from exiting\n    when running tests or benchmarks and allowing stdout output from other tests.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed panic when environment variables contains non-UTF8 characters.\n-   Fixed panic when `CRITERION_DEBUG` or `CRITERION_TARGET_DIR` environment variables contain\n    non-UTF8 characters.\n\n### [`v0.3.1`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;031---2020-01-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added new plotting backend using the `plotters` crate. Implementation generously provided by Hao\n    Hou, author of the `plotters` crate.\n-   Added `--plotting-backend` command-line option to select the plotting backend. The existing\n    gnuplot backend will be used by default when available, and the plotters backend will be used when\n    gnuplot is not available or when requested.\n-   Added `Criterion::plotting_backend()` function to configure the plotting backend in code.\n-   Added `--load-baseline` command-line option to load a baseline for comparison\n    rather than measuring the current code\n-   Benchmark filters can now be regular expressions.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed `fibonacci` functions.\n-   Fixed `#[criterion]` benchmarks ignoring the command-line options.\n-   Fixed incorrect scaling of the violin plots.\n-   Don't print the recommended sample count if it's the same as the configured\n    sample count.\n-   Fix potential panic when `nresamples` is set too low. Also added a warning\n    against setting `nresamples` too low.\n-   Fixed issue where a slow outer closure would cause Criterion.rs to calculate\n    the wrong estimated time and number of iterations in the warm-up phase.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
