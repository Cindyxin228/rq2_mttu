have a use for implementing Hash for Trips or StopTimes yet, nor a good workaround for `Option<f32>` types.\r\n\r\n I'm working on compression of schedules and I think at least the enums should

Most implementions of schedule parsers, such as Google Maps, likely do not store the entire dataset. I attempted to do that and it wound up being over 200 GB for the entire world. Implementations typically store the difference between each stop as an itinerary, and then trips are referenced via an offset to the itinerary. I can copy over the pickup and dropoff fields, and timepoint into my own struct and compute a hash of it, which becomes the Itinerary, then use it to match trip ids with a previous itinerary, along with an offset.\r\n \r\n This paper describes it quite well: https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/SIGSPATIAL_Frequency_based_Search_BBS_2014.pdf\r\n\r\nLike my previous `Clone` pull request, this does increase compile time but is not a breaking change, nor does it worsen runtime.\r\n\r\nThank you so much once again,\r\nKyler Chin", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/issues/164/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/issues/164/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/issues/162", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/issues/162/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/issues/162/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/issues/162/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/pull/162", "id": 2200995567, "node_id": "PR_kwDOB7Soss5qaH__", "number": 162, "title": "Allow Calendar, Shape, Route, and other enums to be clonable, move serde bounds, upgrade from deprecated time function", "user": {"login": "kylerchin", "id": 7539174, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxNzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7539174?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin", "html_url": "https://github.com/kylerchin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerchin/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-03-21T19:28:10Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-22T08:30:30Z", "closed_at": "2024-03-22T08:30:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/pulls/162", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/pull/162", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/pull/162.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-transit/gtfs-structure/pull/162.patch", "merged_at": "2024-03-22T08:30:30Z"}, "body": "I wanted to clone Vec<Shape> to do some analysis on geodesics, and then I realised it wasn't implemented. \r\nThis should not increase runtime, but does increase the binary size slightly as well as compile time.

Transit maintainer team,\r\n\r\nAccording to the GTFS specification, route_short_name and route_long_name are optional if the other one is empty. Should we throw an error if both are empty? \r\n\r\nAdditionally, stops.txt defines `tts_stop_name` as a new optional field which is added for users who rely on screenreaders to navigate the world.  A stop_name is not required for generic / boarding nodes, and a stop_desc is never required. Thus, these have also been made optional.\r\n\r\nThis small change is ready for production.

https://github.com/etalab/transport-validator/issues/172\r\n\r\nMemory consumption is too great because we do the parsing in 2 phases, first into a `RawGtfs` then into a `Gtfs` and during the conversion we have both structures in memory, resulting in doubling the peak memory needed. In the [FR IDF](https://eu.ftp.opendatasoft.com/stif/GTFS/IDFM-gtfs.zip) dataset (~13 000 000 stop times), the RawGTFS takes 2.3 G or memory and the GTFs 2.1G, and the peak memory needed is ~3.9.\r\n\r\nThis PR add a reverse loop on the stop times and schrink to fit the vector (reverse iterating so not to allocate a new vector). Even if it's a naive implementation (we shouldn't have to schrink_to_fit it at every element), it seems the performance impact is negligible and on the IDF dataset `/usr/bin/time` measure goes from
