Because on the forward sync flow the synchronizer needed to wait until the block was executed to establish that the sync was finished, there was some unnecessary complexity added to keep `HaveStrictFinality` as a terminal state which involved more complex checks in other intermediary states like `HaveBlock`, `HaveAllDeploys` etc.\r\nThe same can be said about the historical sync flow where the synchronizer needed to wait for the block to be marked complete.\r\nThis PR introduces a new terminal block acquisition state called `Complete` which fully denotes that the block synchronizer is finished with all tasks involving the block, on both forward and historical sync.\r\nThis simplifies some state transitions since enqueuing the block for execution or requesting the block to be marked complete is only done from the `HaveStrictFinality` state.\r\nFor the forward sync case, there is another intermediary state called `HaveFinalizedBlock`; the block builder transitions to this state after the block has been successfully converted into a block that is ready for execution.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we now allow sync to progress for historical blocks that were created with a protocol version that is older than the one where the requirement for nodes to hold signatures for strict finality was introduced.\r\nIn mainnet this is protocol version 1.5.\r\nFor other networks a configurable chainspec parameter was added to control the version when this requirement was introduced.\r\nBecause pre-1.5 there was no requirement for nodes to retain finality signatures, there may exist networks were all finality signatures for a block are not available in order to reach weak or strict finality.\r\nBecause we have 2 checkpoints for determining if we can progress with the sync (first achieving weak finality, and then strict finality) we employ the `LegacyRequiredFinality` the requirement for the block that is within the criteria described above. Previous code did not take into account the check for weak finality.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3832/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

#3710 \r\nThis PR implements the \"commit_purge\" API in EE and additional machinery in the ContractRuntime component to execute it after each block.\r\n\r\nThere are also improvements to the global state to ensure that deleting an entry from the tip of the trie does not involve deserialization, and additionally, scratch trie was modified to cache the bytes of a trie rather than the trie object itself to allow lazy deserialization. This should reduce the memory footprint of a large delete operation by about 6x.\r\n\r\nCurrently, commit_purge API is called repeatedly after each block is executed with a slice of Key::EraInfo whose length is configured by chainspec's `purge_batch_size`. After several blocks, when there are no more Key::EraInfo entries, the process will be no-op, and at the next protocol version can be disabled by setting `purge_batch_size = 0`\r\n\r\nThe purge of Key::EraInfo consists of two steps:\r\n- At the upgrade point last Key::EraInfo(activation_point_era - 1) will be copied into a Key::EraSummary.\r\n- At the end of each executed block there will be a call to commit_purge to delete N's first Key::EraInfo entries starting from 0.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3811/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Some types abuse the notion of an ID with fairly hefty objects, these have been made to use `Box<T>` as ID. Some other associated types, on the other hand, are moved onto the heap by default.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR replaces all instances of `Box<Option<T>>` with `Option<Box<T>>`.\r\n\r\nNote that a generous `#![allow(clippy::boxed_local)]` is added to some files - I cannot see the value in deboxing/boxing parameters just to pass them on, I prefer to keep the parameters as they come from the

Thus, checking only the parent block wasn't sufficient and a different approach was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds a test that sets up an emergency upgrade from 1.4.7 to 1.4.8, then a regular

The bug scenario is:\r\n- the synchronizer reaches a state where it wants to execute the block\r\n- `need_next` returns `NeedNext::EnqueueForExecution`\r\n- the synchronizer then sets the in flight latch, initiates the event through which a finalized block is created and sent for execution\r\n- if another `register` type of event happens, in this case a finality signature arriving and triggering a `register_finality_signature` and `touch` is called, the in flight latch is reset\r\n- the following `need_next` will still be `NeedNext::EnqueueForExecution`, which leads to multiple attempts to enqueue the block for execution\r\n\r\nThis scenario is not a fatal bug and the synchronizer will complete the block, therefore this PR downgrades the log to a `warn` in case of double enqueuement and also actively prevents it by leveraging the `ExecutionProgress` state to not enqueue a block which has already been enqueued.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3765/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3765/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3763", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3763/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3763/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3763/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3763", "id": 1627247502, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD7qsic5MMpOl", "number": 3763, "title": "Merge core backpressure feature set into 1.6, including ticket system", "user": {"login": "marc-casperlabs", "id": 63730123, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzMwMTIz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63730123?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs", "html_url": "https://github.com/marc-casperlabs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-03-16T11:11:38Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-28T08:59:03Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-24T14:31:32Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/3763", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3763", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3763.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3763.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-24T14:31:32Z"}, "body": "This PR is a part of the core 1.6 feature set, namely adding backpressure. This subset has been rebased onto the latest `feat-1.6` and is kept small to make it amenable to being reviewed in isolation.\r\n\r\nAt its core, it implements two missing features for `muxink`, namely fixed size frames and little endian encoding of fixed size values. The previous design put the encoding at the \"wrong end\" of the chain, making it impossible to use with multiplexing.\r\n\r\nBackpressure is added through a multiplexed back channel for ACKs, with one per outgoing channel. The `Ticket` system is used, meaning that the networking component will consider a message being in the state of \"processing\" until the ticket is dropped, causing it to send the `ACK` soon after. It is up to individual components to fine-grained precise logic, right now it errs on the side of being too permissive by dropping the ticket early.", "reactions": {"url":

#3738 \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a fix to the bug seen in the `swap_validators` test scenario.\r\n\r\nThe nodes which should become validators in the upcoming era and were previously keeping up are synchronizing the switch block, but before getting to execute it, the associated builder would get purged by the switch to `Validate` mode, triggered by `keep_up_should_validate` into `create_required_eras`. `ContractRuntime` would therefore miss the switch block and we would have a gap which would prevent the node from executing the next blocks.\r\n\r\nAnother bug which surfaced in this test scenario was that the nodes which were validating and then were supposed to swap places with other nodes in the upcoming era would stall instead of keeping up. From preliminary observations, it seems they switch from `Validate` to `KeepUp` and then to `CatchUp` with a `Leap` instruction because of stale gossip, trying to leap to the same block they just executed before transitioning from `Validate`. The block builder is never doing any `need_next` action, and the synchronizer is stuck. The node fixes itself at some point in the future through a `Leap` when it falls too much behind the actual tip of the chain.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3735/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3735/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3732", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3732/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3732/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3732/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3732", "id": 1615102461, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD7qsic5Lj_Yk", "number": 3732, "title": "Reduce `MainEvent` size", "user": {"login": "marc-casperlabs", "id": 63730123, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzMwMTIz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63730123?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs", "html_url": "https://github.com/marc-casperlabs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marc-casperlabs/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-03-08T11:19:50Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-14T12:10:23Z", "closed_at": "2023-03-13T16:44:28Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/3732", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3732", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3732.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/3732.patch", "merged_at": "2023-03-13T16:44:28Z"}, "body": "Closes #1959.\r\n\r\nThis shrinks down the size of `MainEvent` from `824` bytes to `360` by moving a few select types from the stack to the heap.

accumulator, and the block synchronizer, it was possible for a block to get marked complete before it was actually stored, which would result in a later unrecoverable error if anything else attempted to read back the supposedly complete block data from storage prior to it actually being stored. this was an edge condition, but when it did occur a node's completed block record was left in an unrecoverable state.\r\n\r\nseparately, removed a risky optimization added recently that suppressed sync leaps considered to be redundant, which did not consider that other nodes' responses to a request for the same block_hash can differ over time; also, on a larger network with more peers it is healthy to get a broader response. \r\n\r\nfinally, added logic to the block synchronizer to actively acquire era validator weights if needed rather than wait for them to potentially be provided which could be a terminal condition if the needed weights were not acquired by other means.

changes the way in which a sync leap response is created.\r\n\r\nPreviously there was an explicit check for sufficient signatures on each block header in the `signed_block_headers`.

provides basic protection against wasting resources when receiving unexpected gossiper messages.\r\n\r\nFor an new incoming `Message::Gossip`, no action will be taken if the given item is not already being handled by the gossiper and if the item is already held in storage other than sending a `Message::GossipResponse`.  Potentially even sending the response could be omitted, but this might be overkill given how cheap that is to send and considering that the sender might not be malicious.\r\n\r\nFor all other incoming message variants, if the given item is not already being handled by the gossiper then no action is taken.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is now a timeout associated with handling a `Message::Item`.  The expectation in this flow is that after making the item body announcement (i.e. after calling `EffectBuilder::announce_item_body_received_via_gossip()`) then some other component will handle validating and storing the item, and will then re-engage the gossiper by creating an `ItemReceived` event.  However, if validation or storing fails, then the gossiper is not notified.  This new timeout ensures that in such a case the entry in the gossip table is force-finished and will subsequently be purged.\r\n\r\nCloses #3572.", "reactions": {"url":

#3618\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new announcement for finalized blocks enqueued for execution, but which contract runtime will not execute because their height is lower than the next expected executable height. In this scenario, contract runtime will raise this announcement which will be handled by the reactor. If there is a complete block in storage with that same height, it means the block can be safely considered executed and the reactor raises an event letting consensus know that the finalized block it had enqueued was handled, the same way it would happen if the block was executed. Consensus is oblivious to the fact that execution didn't take place.\r\n\r\nWe do this to ensure the smooth operation of the consensus validating process in the case of a restart in the middle of an era, where the restarted node couldn't make any consensus proposals until all the previous blocks in the era along with their vertices were \"executed\".\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

fixes two nctl upgrade tests.  The tests both involved having nodes 1 and 10 missing the upgrade (running through it but without the new binary staged) then restarting them after staging their upgrades to ensure they rejoin and sync up.\r\n\r\nWith the network component now rejecting connections between different protocol versions, the two affected nodes need to have their launchers' state files removed so that on restart the launcher runs the highest binary.\r\n\r\nCloses #3619.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/3625/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
