have no entry written for it in the `transfers_db`, causing the JSON-RPC `chain_get_block_transfers` to report the block's transfers as `null` rather than `[]`\r\n* for a block with a non-zero number of successful transfers, if its execution results were put to storage more than once, the initial valid entry in the `transfers_db` would be overwritten with an invalid empty collection, causing the JSON-RPC `chain_get_block_transfers` to report the block's transfers as `[]` rather then the correct value\r\n\r\nTh fix is to have `Storage` reconstitute the correct value when reading from `transfers_db` if it encounters a missing value or an empty collection, and store the corrected value before returning it.  The `Storage::write_execution_results` method has also been corrected to not overwrite good values with empty collections.\r\n\r\nCloses #4255.\r\nCloses #4268.", "reactions": {"url":

thrust of this change is, delegator bids are stored as top-level entries in global state under a composite key instead of embedded in a collection within their applicable validator's bid; this allows each bid to be interacted with atomically and avoids the deep copy issue of embedded collections within a stored value. there is a downside; getting total stake for a validator, reporting, and distributing rewards requires a lot more reads. this can be mitigated by adding a lazy last-era in-mem cache, which I propose we do in a separate optimization PR.\r\n\r\nsecondarily, empty (0 balance) bids and slashed bids are now pruned from the global state pathing (will not be included under the newly calculated root hash); this reduces width of a slice of global state at the tip of the chain. \r\n\r\nthirdly, the unbond experience is simplified. an attempt to unbond an amount greater than stake previously resulted in an error. the logic has been changed to simply unbond all of the stake when the attempted amount is higher rather than error. adjacent to this, previously an attempt to fully unbond was complicated by the fact that we re-stake rewards. there is an edge case of a fully unbonded bid gaining stake again due to the end of era reward for their last, leading to \"dust\" in their bonding purse. the logic now instead applies the delayed reward payout to the appropriate unbonding purse avoiding this issue.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4196/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

`EntryPointType::Normal` variant that defines default entry point type that in 2.0 will act as a 1.x -\r\n- Both new variants act as a 1.x `EntryPointType::Contract`\r\n- New `EntryPointAccess::Abstract` variant that marks the entry point export as exists in the wasm bytecode but is not callable. It can be referenced from a contract that is stored as `EntryPointType::Install`.\r\n- It is possible for `EntryPointType::Install` to define the new `EntryPointType::Install` as in the factory of factories.\r\n\r\nAn example smart contract that utilizes this pattern can be found here:

changes the node to use `ExecutionJournal` in place of `ExecutionEffects`.\r\n\r\n`ExecutionJournal` has been moved to `casper-types` accordingly, and while the old `ExecutionEffects` type in `casper-types` has been retained for syncing and reporting of historical data, the equivalent type in EE has been removed.\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionJournal` also dropped the `Operations` field as this was unused and not populated, leaving the journal as simply a `Vec<Transform>`.\r\n\r\nThis work introduced a need for a new enum `ExecutionResult` holding old and new forms of execution results.  The `casper_execution_engine::engine_state::ExecutionResult` was updated to hold an `ExecutionJournal`, and we only need to support one flavour of this type, so it's not versioned.  However, the `casper_types::execution::ExecutionResult` became `casper_types::execution::ExecutionResultV1` and was otherwise structurally unchanged, as this is the type held in Storage and which is sent to other nodes/clients on demand.  The new `casper_types::execution::ExecutionResultV2` is equivalent to the updated `casper_execution_engine::engine_state::ExecutionResult` (with the difference continuing to be that the error type of the `casper_types` one is a `String` as `casper-types` has no access to EE error types).\r\n\r\nSince Storage had to be updated to hold the new `ExecutionResult`s, I also took the opportunity to fix the long-standing issue of multiple execution results being attributed to a single deploy.  There is now a 1-1 mapping of deploy to execution result.\r\n\r\nThis PR is blocked by [client PR #85](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-client-rs/pull/85), since CI will likely fail until the client is updated.\r\n\r\nCloses #2124.\r\nCloses [#160](https://github.com/casper-network/roadmap/issues/160).", "reactions": {"url":

introduces the `Transaction` type a.k.a \"Version 2 Deploy\".  It is expected that further changes and additions will be needed to many of the new types as they are integrated into the EE and node codebases.\r\n\r\nMuch of the code is copied from `Deploy`, but there are some significant differences:\r\n* session code has been renamed `body: TransactionKind` which is a much more fine grained breakdown of the various execution modes compared to deploy's `ExecutableDeployItem`\r\n* there is no payment code: standard payment will be assumed unless the Transaction includes custom payment logic in provided body Wasm\r\n* ~the `TransactionHash` is a hash over \"signing hash + approvals\", where the \"signing hash\" is a hash over the header and the body.  The signing hash is not recorded anywhere; it is calculated only when required (once for verification, and once per new approval added).  This approach, where the `TransactionHash` includes the approvals, means that there should be no need to record hashes of approvals in global state.~ This change was reverted on instructions of @EdHastingsCasperLabs \r\n* ~the body hash has been removed from the header, since it served no useful purpose.  Transactions (and deploys) are never provided to clients or other nodes as just headers, they are always provided as full transactions/deploys, hence there is no benefit to recording the body hash in the header~ This change was reverted on instructions of @EdHastingsCasperLabs \r\n* the `dependencies` field has been removed from the header as it is also unused\r\n* the `gas_price` has been repurposed into a `PricingMode` where `PricingMode::GasPriceMultiplier` represents the current `gas_price` behaviour\r\n\r\nNote that the \"interesting\" changes are contained within the first commit.  The second commit touches a lot of files, but is simply a cleanup of the `runtime_args!` macro.\r\n\r\nCloses [#181](https://github.com/casper-network/roadmap/issues/181).\r\nCloses

`casper-storage` crate.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, types were removed or their scope reduced, allowing the flattening of a couple of modules.\r\n\r\nIn EE:\r\n* `Config` removed as unused\r\n* `shared::logging` removed as unused (engine test support crate now uses `env-logger`)\r\n* `shared::test_utils` removed as unused\r\n* `shared::utils` removed (only OS page size functionality retained, but moved to `casper-types`)\r\n* `shared::wasm_prep` moved to `runtime` and its functions' scopes reduced\r\n* `shared::execution_journal` moved to `engine_state`\r\n* `shared` removed\r\n* `core` removed and its modules raised a level\r\n\r\nIn EE tests:\r\n* `logging` removed as unused\r\n* `profiling` folder containing source for three binaries removed along with a single smart contract associated with them.  These tools are no longer useful and don't currently run successfully.\r\n\r\nIn storage:\r\n* `global_state::shared::make_array_newtype!` moved to the single test where it is used\r\n* `global_state::shared::correlation_id` removed as previously agreed as unnecessary\r\n* `global_state::storage` removed and its modules raised a level\r\n\r\nA future PR will address moving `ExecutionJournal` and its nested types into `casper-types`.  This will allow the removal of `storage::global_state::shared` entirely.\r\n\r\nCloses [#153](https://github.com/casper-network/roadmap/issues/153)\r\nCloses #2760.\r\nCloses #4064.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4092/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4092/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4086", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4086/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4086/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4086/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4086", "id": 1777007528, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD7qsic5UCdkK", "number": 4086, "title": "node/rpc-server/query_global_state: make state_identifier optional", "user": {"login": "alsrdn", "id": 86006646, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA2NjQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86006646?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn", "html_url": "https://github.com/alsrdn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-06-27T13:42:25Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-04T19:07:14Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-04T19:07:14Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/4086", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4086", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4086.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4086.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-04T19:07:14Z"}, "body": "Make the `state_identifier` parameter of the `query_global_state` JSON-RPC method optional.

casper-types.\r\n\r\nAs part of that PR, two custom serializers in the `ExecutableDeployItem` enum were removed which shouldn't have been, meaning that parsing such an item which was stored e.g. by a 1.4.x node would fail.\r\n\r\nA further issue was that binary serialization of `casper-node::types::DeployHash` delegated to `Digest`, which delegated to `Vec<u8>` for legacy reasons.  When bincode-encoding such a `DeployHash` it has a length prepended to the serialized data.  This is still how the moved `DeployHash` is handled.  However, prior to the move, there was a `casper_types::DeployHash` which delegated to `[u8; 32]` for binary serialization.  Bincode does not prepend a length for a fixed-length array like this.  As such, to retain the ability to parse historical stored data which held an old `casper_types::DeployHash`, we need to provide helpers to use array-style encoding rather than Vec.\r\n\r\nCloses #4074.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4079/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4079/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4075", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4075/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4075/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/4075/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4075", "id": 1768051724, "node_id": "PR_kwDOD7qsic5Tkk6w", "number": 4075, "title": "consensus: don't error when deactivating era more than once", "user": {"login": "alsrdn", "id": 86006646, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA2NjQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86006646?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn", "html_url": "https://github.com/alsrdn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "alsrdn", "id": 86006646, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA2NjQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86006646?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn", "html_url": "https://github.com/alsrdn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "alsrdn", "id": 86006646, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA2NjQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86006646?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn", "html_url": "https://github.com/alsrdn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alsrdn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2023-06-21T17:08:21Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-27T12:48:31Z", "closed_at": "2023-06-27T12:48:31Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/4075", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4075", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4075.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/4075.patch", "merged_at": "2023-06-27T12:48:31Z"}, "body": "Don't return a fatal error when trying to deactivate an era that was already deactivated.\r\nIn the case where a node unbonds and drops from the validator list, it will switch to `KeepUp` in order to follow the chain.
