**lazily** formatted when logging errors.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in our codebase, we often log errors like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmatch result {\r\n    Error(err) {\r\n        warn!(%err, \"something happened');\r\n    }\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the drawback of swallowing the errors causes, which are often more interesting than the potentially wrapping error itself.\r\n\r\nThis can now be addressed by using the `display_error` function:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmatch result {\r\n    Error(ref err) {\r\n        warn!(err=display_error(err), \"something happened');\r\n    }\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will cause the error to be output as \"error: cause1: cause 2\" instead.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be handled using `tracing`'s built-in functionality, but the implementation is lagging behind/buggy; the `display_error` functions documentation has details on how this should be replaced once `tracing` upstream has addressed the issue.\r\n\r\nThe whole codebase will need to be ultimately updated, this PR addresses `small_network` as a first proving grounds for the change.", "reactions": {"url":

received for that block before the block itself was finalized on our own node. We should collect only finality signatures that we have already verified and that come from bonded validator. Unfortunately, we didn't wait for the last part \u2013 we would collect (and return) signatures that are valid but _might_ be from validators that are not bonded.\r\n\r\nMore details in the JIRA

blocked during the current grace period) and determine their IP address as well from the logs. This is done through two changes:\r\n\r\n1. The existing `warn!` log message that logged when a peer would have been blocked has been updated to include the peer's node id (sometimes called peer ID).\r\n2. The existing log for established connections has been upgrade from a `debug!` log level to an `info!` log level.\r\n\r\nThe code changes are minimal, containing only a slight alteration to the logging calls. The most dramatic effect is a great increase in log messages, as every successful connection will now result in an INFO level log message.\r\n\r\n## Node operator recommendations\r\n\r\nTo find peers that would have been blocked (either due to misconfiguration, bugs or genuine malicious behavior), a node operator should monitor the logs for the WARN level message that says `peer deemed potentially byzantine`. Upon finding such a message, they should search the log backwards to find a INFO level message that maps a peer's node ID to an actual address: \"established incoming connection\".\r\n\r\nPlease note that the address listed there is not the public address of the peer, but rather the outgoing one; for the listening address the port will be different. This may be an issue in cases where a single IP hosts multiple nodes, but we believe this better than the alternative of using the node supplied address, which is would be prone to forgery by the sender. In most cases, the IP address alone should be sufficient to find the node in question.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1190/reactions",
