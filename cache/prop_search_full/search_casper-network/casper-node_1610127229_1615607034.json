fixes the gossiper metrics, some of which are fairly useless at the moment.\r\n\r\n* `items_received` now correctly represents the total of all gossip items received, whether passed to the component by a client, by a different component (e.g. the small network in the case of starting a new round of gossiping its own address) or by a peer gossiping it.\r\n* `items_gossiped_onwards` has been replaced by `times_gossiped` and now represents the total number of outbound gossip messages the node has sent.\r\n\r\nIt also standardises the unregistering of metrics from the Prometheus registry to remove the risky calls to `expect` in the `Drop` impls of many of the metrics structs.  If there are objections to the introduction of a macro to achieve this, I would be happy to change it back to normal function calls.\r\n\r\nTagging @sacherjj & @TomVasile for info.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1063/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1063/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1062", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1062/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1062/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1062/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1062", "id": 821696173, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTg0NDQwNTY2", "number": 1062, "title": "NO-TICKET: change activation point to represent era ID or genesis timestamp", "user": {"login": "Fraser999", "id": 190532, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDUzMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/190532?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fraser999", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fraser999/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/milestones/3/labels", "id": 6507210, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjUwNzIxMA==", "number": 3, "title": "1.1.0", "description": "First Mainnet update", "creator": {"login": "piotr-dziubecki", "id": 59571310, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTcxMzEw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59571310?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki", "html_url": "https://github.com/piotr-dziubecki", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 2, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2021-03-04T15:07:26Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-10T12:49:22Z", "due_on": "2021-04-06T00:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2021-05-10T12:49:22Z"}, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-03-04T02:46:12Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-04T15:19:22Z", "closed_at": "2021-03-04T14:23:25Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/1062", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1062", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1062.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1062.patch", "merged_at": "2021-03-04T14:23:25Z"}, "body": "This PR unifies the genesis timestamp and upgrade activation point into a single enum type.\r\n\r\nDuring a discussion with @EdHastingsCasperLabs, it was noted that genesis timestamps for all chainspecs after the genesis one become meaningless and could be omitted.

Currently, when we restart after an upgrade from the delta network where the upgrade was a hard-reset, the joining node will start with a cached/stored version > 1.0.0.  When the second binary is started, this causes it to attempt to call the EE `commit_upgrade` passing the same version for the current and new protocols.\r\n\r\nTo get round this, we simply ignore the cached/stored version when calling `commit_upgrade`.  Instead we use a hard-coded `1.0.0` for the current version and the one provided in the chainspec as the new version.  This will need extended if we end up running 0.8.0 nodes on delta in order to be able to upgrade from those.  Hopefully this will not be needed, and it certainly won't be needed in master where we can avoid caching/storing the protocol version in the chainspec loader as it will be available in the block

fixes an issue in the gossip table whereby gossip items could avoid being moved to the `finished` or `paused` state, hence leaving the item in the `current` state indefinitely, blocking any further attempts to handle gossip for that item.\r\n\r\nWe have a termination condition of knowing about `x` peers which hold the data in question, `x` being configurable and set to 15 currently.  We could reach this termination condition in a few different ways:\r\n1. by receiving a response from a peer we gossiped the item to\r\n2. by timing out a response we never got from a peer we gossiped the item to\r\n3. by receiving the item as a gossip request from a peer\r\n\r\nThe issue is that we currently only move an item from `current` to `finished` or `paused` when handling situation 1.  Situation 2 was assumed to be unneeded as that should trigger a fresh attempt to gossip to a different peer, and _that_ response would eventually be received or a different peer chosen, and so on.\r\n\r\nHowever, if in the meantime we received enough gossip requests from peers to reach the termination condition (situation 3), then when the timeout was triggered, we would recognise that we should no longer gossip this item, and no further gossip request was sent.  This broke the assumption that we would eventually handle a response from a peer.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I have updated the logic to move an item to the `finished` state from `current` (or `paused`) when we reach the termination condition in all three of these scenarios.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1021/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1021/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1020", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1020/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1020/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/issues/1020/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1020", "id": 817416183, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTgwOTEyNjEw", "number": 1020, "title": "NO-TICKET: Enable the \"sync over upgrades\" IT test.", "user": {"login": "goral09", "id": 5120801, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA4MDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5120801?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09", "html_url": "https://github.com/goral09", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goral09/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/milestones/2", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/milestone/2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/milestones/2/labels", "id": 6506003, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjUwNjAwMw==", "number": 2, "title": "Mainnet", "description": "Mainnent release", "creator": {"login": "piotr-dziubecki", "id": 59571310, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTcxMzEw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59571310?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki", "html_url": "https://github.com/piotr-dziubecki", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piotr-dziubecki/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 166, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2021-03-04T08:31:11Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-10T12:49:30Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2021-05-10T12:49:30Z"}, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2021-02-26T14:47:08Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-09T12:50:33Z", "closed_at": "2021-03-01T18:14:46Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casper-network/casper-node/pulls/1020", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1020", "diff_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1020.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/1020.patch", "merged_at": "2021-03-01T18:14:45Z"}, "body": "`master` branch is now ready for this test.
