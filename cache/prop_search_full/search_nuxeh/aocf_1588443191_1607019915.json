This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates). When you merge this pull request, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub](https://github.com/nuxeh/aocf/network/updates), rather than the [Dependabot dashboard](https://app.dependabot.com/), to monitor your version updates. Dependabot is now configured exclusively using config files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues) repository.\n\n[Learn more about the relaunch of Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/)\n\nPlease note that regular `@dependabot` commands do not work on this pull request.\n\n:robot::yellow_heart:\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nuxeh/aocf/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nuxeh/aocf/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
