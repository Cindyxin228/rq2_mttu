changelog](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).*\n\n> 1.2.1 (2019-08-03)\n> ==================\n> This release does a bit of house cleaning. Namely:\n> \n> * This repository is now using rustfmt.\n> * License headers have been removed from all files, in following suit with the\n>   Rust project.\n> * Teddy has been removed from the `regex` crate, and is now part of the\n>   `aho-corasick` crate.\n>   [See `aho-corasick`'s new `packed` sub-module for details](https://docs.rs/aho-corasick/0.7.6/aho_corasick/packed/index.html).\n> * The `utf8-ranges` crate has been deprecated, with its functionality moving\n>   into the\n>   [`utf8` sub-module of `regex-syntax`](https://docs.rs/regex-syntax/0.6.11/regex_syntax/utf8/index.html).\n> * The `ucd-util` dependency has been dropped, in favor of implementing what\n>   little we need inside of `regex-syntax` itself.\n> \n> In general, this is part of an ongoing (long term) effort to make optimizations\n> in the regex engine easier to reason about. The current code is too convoluted\n> and thus it is very easy to introduce new bugs. This simplification effort is\n> the primary motivation behind re-working the `aho-corasick` crate to not only\n> bundle algorithms like Teddy, but to also provide regex-like match semantics\n> automatically.\n> \n> Moving forward, the plan is to join up with the `bstr` and `regex-automata`\n> crates, with the former providing more sophisticated substring search\n> algorithms (thereby deleting existing code in `regex`) and the latter providing\n> ahead-of-time compiled DFAs for cases where they are inexpensive to compute.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- [`0b1e1e8`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/0b1e1e8c54287d382e505acc68d983801daddeee) 1.2.1\n- [`169783c`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/169783c1d6e045ff2ee418ea3556d09ed97e8f3c) syntax: release 0.6.11\n- [`b4c67cb`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/b4c67cb80cb3aae246e192afa5ea10b66d18639d) syntax: drop ucd_util dependency\n- [`caa075f`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/caa075f653e96345843b04e9591d86b55985ffb4) syntax: absorb utf8-ranges crate\n- [`6b86983`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/6b869838f107d4c92bd80c0cab3543131f406a73) literal: remove teddy\n- [`fc3e6aa`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/fc3e6aa19aaaf929fd89395ee976456b5b3a8720) license: remove license headers from files\n- [`0e96af4`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/0e96af41667228cb83eff32b44db057f5be16c62) style: start using rustfmt\n- [`341f207`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/341f207c1071f7290e3f228c710817c280c8dca1) regex-syntax-0.6.10\n- [`dc111a5`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/dc111a5f19f0b1e2b6c55391391b99bb09869d1f) syntax: update Unicode ages lookup\n- See full diff in [compare view](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1)\n</details>\n<br />\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=regex&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=1.2.0&new-version=1.2.1)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score.html?dependency-name=regex&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=1.2.0&new-version=1.2.1)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
