Lake Primitives.\r\n\r\nThe base branch is `0.8.0`, we're moving to the release.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Update Mar 31, '23\r\n\r\nAfter comments and discussions around this PR and around the naming convention I've introduced, I ended up doing a pretty big refactoring.\r\n\r\nLet me give some context. The main concerns raised around the renaming of `near_primitives::views::ActionView` to the `lake_primitives::receipts::Operation` and all the related parts. \r\nInitially, I thought it was a great decision since we had a structure like `Action` representing the `ReceiptEnumView::Action` from `near-primitives`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Action {\r\n    receipt_id: CryptoHash,\r\n    predecessor_id: AccountId,\r\n    receiver_id: AccountId,\r\n    signer_id: AccountId,\r\n    signer_public_key: PublicKey,\r\n    operations: Vec<Operation>,\r\n // ^^^^^^^^^^ this one\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it looked pretty decent until NEP-366 with DelegateAction came to town. \r\n\r\nQuick recap the DelegateAction is a new variant for `ActionView` that contains `actions` too, and those actions are a set of almost the same `ActionView` except for the `DelegateAction` itself.\r\n\r\nAnd here's where confusion raises. Renaming the variant to `DelegateOperation` looks like a really bad idea, I've tried to rename the underlying field `actions` to `operations` and all things went even worse.\r\n\r\nSo I got back to the old conversation with @frol where he suggested this high-level version of the framework and primitives to focus on the Actions and Events instead of the core low-level primitives as we used to do. Most developers should not even care about `Transactions` or `Receipts` or something else. They really should be focusing on Actions that happened on-chain and Events produced. It led me to describe the idea in Lake Enhancement Proposal 002 (LEP-002). *Yeah, I have started LEPs similarly to NEPs. Though it's internal now until I decide where to publish them more conveniently.*\r\n\r\nSo this PR is a result of huge refactoring motived by the NEP-366.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/67/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/67/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs/pull/66", "id": 1621965562, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG0q8ic5L604J", "number": 66, "title": "fix(tests): Resolved #60: Fix failing doc tests", "user": {"login": "khorolets", "id": 3235740, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzU3NDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3235740?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets", "html_url": "https://github.com/khorolets", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/milestones/3/labels", "id": 8947177, "node_id": "MI_kwDOG0q8ic4AiIXp", "number": 3, "title": "0.8.0 High-level update", "description": "**NB!** This milestone used to be `0.7.0` but the version was postponed because of the necessity to introduce breaking changes to underlying dependency (re: NEP-366)\r\n\r\n## 0.8.0 High-level Update\r\n\r\nWe are aiming to create a big release for the Lake Framework.

inspired by https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-js/pull/4, but so far in my testing I actually hit the network limit sooner than this streaming limitation when I am testing it on the server (it can reach 1000 bps but then stuck for 5-10 seconds waiting for some delayed response). This approach is still more tolerant to sudden delays and it appears to be working better for the account activity indexer (where there is some actual block processing happening). Ultimately, I saw 150-450 bps on the current master branch and 150-600 bps on this PR branch when the block processing is actually just a print statement.\r\n\r\nThis also should cut the AWS costs on re-indexing since we do fewer ListObjectV2 calls (previously we called it with the limit of 100 keys, which is only 20 blocks when it comes to the point where we have 4 shards, but now we call it with [100 * 2 * (1 + 4)] 1000 keys).\r\n\r\nThis also closes #32, though with the streaming improvements we can afford to list more block heights ahead of time (twice the size of the blocks preload pool multiplied by the number of files for each block (1 for block-header.json + N for shards)).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/38/reactions",
