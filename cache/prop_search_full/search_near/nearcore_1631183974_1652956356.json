minor changes to the code.\r\n\r\nFirstly, change type of col_state_cache_size and block_size fields to\r\nbytesize::ByteSize so that they are strongly typed.  With that change,\r\nintroduce col_cache_size which returns cache size for given column.\r\n\r\nSecondly, change how default_* functinos used by serde deserialisation\r\nare defined.  Rather than them returning constans they construct\r\na default StoreConfig object and return value of corresponding field.\r\nThis also allows the DEFAULT_* fields in the structure to no longr be\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, make all functions const because why not?\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/6815/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/6815/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/6814", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/6814/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/6814/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/6814/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6814", "id": 1238361895, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCQUkYs438Wc0", "number": 6814, "title": "test: add imports to runtime fuzzing setup", "user": {"login": "mooori", "id": 32731489, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzMxNDg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32731489?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori", "html_url": "https://github.com/mooori", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mooori/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-05-17T09:37:29Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-25T05:55:26Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-18T10:11:14Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/pulls/6814", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6814", "diff_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6814.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6814.patch", "merged_at": "2022-05-18T10:11:14Z"}, "body": "Imports are specified by implementing [`available_imports`](https://docs.rs/wasm-smith/0.10.0/wasm_smith/trait.Config.html#method.available_imports) for `ModuleConfig`,\r\nwhich is then used in [`wasm_smith::ConfiguredModule<ModuleConfig>`](https://docs.rs/wasm-smith/0.10.0/wasm_smith/struct.ConfiguredModule.html).\r\nPreviously, `wasm_smith::Module` and its default configuration were used.\r\n\r\nTo get the imports of near host functions, test contract [`test-contract-rs`](https://github.com/near/nearcore/tree/master/runtime/near-test-contracts/test-contract-rs) is\r\nused.

The root cause was chunk validation failure - e.g. due to node DB corruption or old supported protocol version. And only then node tried to create a chunk state challenge and failed because we don't support it. However, such misleading error must not occur in production.\r\n\r\nHere we solve the issue by disable storage proof generation, because challenges are not enabled yet, so now unsupported `TrieRecordingStorage` will not be called.\r\n\r\nAnother option was to support chunk nodes cache for `TrieRecordingStorage`, but because it should be properly tested and we won't actually use its functionality, I choose the current approach. \r\n\r\n**We may want to include this fix into mainnet release if this is still possible.**\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n* Update `test_verify_chunk_invalid_state_challenge`\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nIt feels suboptimal that `create_chunk_state_challenge` was covered only by one test for which `receipts` was empty. If it contained at least one receipt, it would catch the error.

config file per version with a base\r\n`parameters.txt` file plus differential files per version.\r\nThe `RuntimeConfig` remains untouched. But it is now loaded from the\r\nflat list of parameters, that converts it to JSON structured data following\r\nthe exact layout we use in code, that is then converted to an actual struct\r\nusing serde derived code.\r\n\r\nThe new TXT files are written in a custom format for key-values separated\r\nby a column. Keys must match a defined parameter and values are strings \r\nor integers. Differential files include old and new values with a `->` between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe direct benefit of this is better readability for config changes and\r\nan easier and less error-prone process of doing such changes.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, this could be the first step to further clean up code\r\naround gas costs.\r\n(1) the gas profile could use these parameters to track costs instead\r\nof its own `enum Cost`.\r\n(2) The params-estimator can link estimations to params more easily.\r\n\r\nTest plan\r\n---------\r\nThe usage of `RuntimeConfigStore` has not changed, only how it is\r\ncreated. Therefore, tests can ensure all stored `RuntimeConfig`\r\nversions are exactly the same as before. And this should be sufficient\r\nto confirm this change has no side-effects.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, we keep the old JSON files in the `legacy_configs`\r\ndirectory. The test `test_old_and_new_runtime_config_format_match` then\r\niterates through all existing versions and compares the serde\r\ndeserialization with configs loaded from TXT files. This is all we need to\r\nverify correctness of the parameters loaded through the new files.\r\n\r\nThe new TXT file format also comes with custom parsing logic.
