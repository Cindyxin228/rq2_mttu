Lake Primitives.\r\n\r\nThe base branch is `0.8.0`, we're moving to the release.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Update Mar 31, '23\r\n\r\nAfter comments and discussions around this PR and around the naming convention I've introduced, I ended up doing a pretty big refactoring.\r\n\r\nLet me give some context. The main concerns raised around the renaming of `near_primitives::views::ActionView` to the `lake_primitives::receipts::Operation` and all the related parts. \r\nInitially, I thought it was a great decision since we had a structure like `Action` representing the `ReceiptEnumView::Action` from `near-primitives`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Action {\r\n    receipt_id: CryptoHash,\r\n    predecessor_id: AccountId,\r\n    receiver_id: AccountId,\r\n    signer_id: AccountId,\r\n    signer_public_key: PublicKey,\r\n    operations: Vec<Operation>,\r\n // ^^^^^^^^^^ this one\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it looked pretty decent until NEP-366 with DelegateAction came to town. \r\n\r\nQuick recap the DelegateAction is a new variant for `ActionView` that contains `actions` too, and those actions are a set of almost the same `ActionView` except for the `DelegateAction` itself.\r\n\r\nAnd here's where confusion raises. Renaming the variant to `DelegateOperation` looks like a really bad idea, I've tried to rename the underlying field `actions` to `operations` and all things went even worse.\r\n\r\nSo I got back to the old conversation with @frol where he suggested this high-level version of the framework and primitives to focus on the Actions and Events instead of the core low-level primitives as we used to do. Most developers should not even care about `Transactions` or `Receipts` or something else. They really should be focusing on Actions that happened on-chain and Events produced. It led me to describe the idea in Lake Enhancement Proposal 002 (LEP-002). *Yeah, I have started LEPs similarly to NEPs. Though it's internal now until I decide where to publish them more conveniently.*\r\n\r\nSo this PR is a result of huge refactoring motived by the NEP-366.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/67/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/67/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/issues/66/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs/pull/66", "id": 1621965562, "node_id": "PR_kwDOG0q8ic5L604J", "number": 66, "title": "fix(tests): Resolved #60: Fix failing doc tests", "user": {"login": "khorolets", "id": 3235740, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzU3NDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3235740?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets", "html_url": "https://github.com/khorolets", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/khorolets/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/near-lake-framework-rs/milestones/3/labels", "id": 8947177, "node_id": "MI_kwDOG0q8ic4AiIXp", "number": 3, "title": "0.8.0 High-level update", "description": "**NB!** This milestone used to be `0.7.0` but the version was postponed because of the necessity to introduce breaking changes to underlying dependency (re: NEP-366)\r\n\r\n## 0.8.0 High-level Update\r\n\r\nWe are aiming to create a big release for the Lake Framework.
