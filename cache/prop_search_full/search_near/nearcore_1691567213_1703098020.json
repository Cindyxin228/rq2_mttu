and `chunk`.\r\nThe first one needed for compatibility with current protocol, where we process missing chunks immediately on receiving block, thus missing chunks are effectively processed before executed chunk.\r\nThe second one is needed to generate post state root for latest processed block, to make it pre state root for newly processed chunk.\r\n\r\nHowever, it will be useful for switching

chunk. Adding a transaction to the chunk can be computationally expensive - the transaction is converted to receipt, which burns gas. Because of that the number of transactions has to be limited. The node will fetch transactions until some kind of limit is reached, and then decide that the chunk is ready and publish it.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have a limit of gas that can be used for preparing transactions, but there is a big problem with it - it doesn't take into account discarding invalid transactions from the pool. Processing an invalid transaction doesn't burn gas, so the node could spend a lot of time discarding invalid transactions without ever reaching the limit. This would make chunk production very slow and the others might decide to just skip the chunk instead of waiting for it.\r\n\r\nLet's add another limit to `prepare_transactions`: a time limit. When producing a chunk the node will be allowed to add new transactions to the chunk for up to X milliseconds. This will ensure that a chunk is produced quickly, even when there are many invalid transactions.\r\n\r\nChoosing a good value for the limit is difficult, so a new config option is added to allow changing it on the fly: `produce_chunk_add_transactions_time_limit`.\r\n\r\nThe default value for the time limit is 200ms. The reasoning for choosing this value is as follows:\r\n* Assuming that we want to produce ~1 block per second, 200ms is the largest value that would support that. If my understanding of the flow is correct, a 200ms chunk production would look like this:\r\n  * Chunk producer produces a chunk (200ms)\r\n  * Chunk producer publishes the chunk (50ms (?))\r\n  * Validator receives the chunk\r\n  * Validator validates the transactions, redoing chunk producer's work (200ms)\r\n  * Validator runs receipts (500ms)\r\n  \r\n  This gives us a 1s time to produce a block.\r\n* Looking at the metrics from mainnet, the P99 time to produce a chunk is ~60ms (and maximum is similar). 200ms is more than three times that, so it shouldn't break anything on the chain: https://nearinc.grafana.net/d/cd668436-f19a-4f3d-b4a5-a35ebd3701b0/chunk-production-stats?from=now-12h&to=now&refresh=1h&orgId=1\r\n* During the minting of NEAT, the P99 time to produce a chunk jumped to ~860ms. This is unacceptable, as this will cause the chain to produce less than one block per second. This limit would prevent that. https://nearinc.grafana.net/d/cd668436-f19a-4f3d-b4a5-a35ebd3701b0/chunk-production-stats?from=1701298800000&to=1701342000000&orgId=1\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed

https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/518\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/10018.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\nWe want the NEAR Protocol's ecosystem to be closer with Ethereum by integrating Web3 wallet support.\r\nTo accomplish that, some changes on the protocol level are needed with an emphasis on user experience continuity.\r\nFollowing the design, the main change on the protocol level would be to have ETH-style addresses managed by a new `Wallet Contract` integrated into the protocol. For seamless onboarding of EVM users, the contract will be free of charge.\r\n\r\n### Previous work\r\nThis PR is built on top of two PRs:\r\n* https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10020: no-op PR, laying groundwork for further changes.\r\n* https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10224: empty contract as a placeholder, literally deployed to new ETH accounts.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThis PR adds `near-wallet-contract` crate (based on `runtime/near-test-contracts`) that exposes `Wallet Contract` WASM code to the runtime.\r\nIt stops deploying a copy of the `Wallet Contract` to each newly created ETH-implicit account.\r\nInstead, it uses an in-memory cached contract code on `execute_function_call` action from such account.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add `wallet-contract` crate (separated from the workspace) with placeholder `Wallet Contract` implementation.\r\n- Add `near-wallet-contract` crate (part of the workspace) that generates (through `build.rs`) and exposes the `Wallet Contract` WASM code.\r\n- Do not literally deploy `Wallet Contract` when creating ETH-implicit account. Just store reference to the `Wallet Contract`.\r\n- Treat ETH-implicit accounts specially when retrieving contract code from an account (in such case returns in-memory cached `Wallet Contract` code).\r\n- Add tests calling `Wallet Contract` where a transfer from an ETH-implicit account is possible depending on the public key passed with `rlp_transaction` argument.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10269/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10269/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10268", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10268/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10268/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10268/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10268", "id": 2017209621, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCQUkYs5gs9kk", "number": 10268, "title": "feat: use the < operator instead of cmp method to improve readability", "user": {"login": "jancionear", "id": 149345204, "node_id": "U_kgDOCObTtA", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149345204?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear", "html_url": "https://github.com/jancionear", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jancionear/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-11-29T18:48:39Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-30T15:26:07Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-30T15:26:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/pulls/10268", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10268", "diff_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10268.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10268.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-30T15:26:06Z"}, "body": "The following code is currently used for comparing `boundary_account` and `account_id`:\r\n```rust\r\nif boundary_account.cmp(account_id) == Greater {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO it's a bit confusing - it isn't immediately obvious whether this means `boundary_account` > `account_id` or `account_id` > `boundary_account`.

sometimes it takes minutes for a transaction to be recorded on chain.\r\nMy guess is that it takes that much time to record a transaction on chain, because it gets forwarded to nodes which either:\r\n* fail to produce their chunks\r\n* don't have time to process incoming tx RPCs before producing their chunks\r\n* the node producing a tx is out of sync and the set of validators is already too late\r\n\r\nAll of these can be fixed by multicasting transactions further into the future.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the simplest attempt to send transactions further into the future.\r\n\r\nTested: Had a testnet node and submitted a tx that was supposed to be forwarded to chunk producers of the next 100 blocks. In practice it gets forwarded to 5 validators.

All passing tests verify that old and new jobs generate the same result.\r\nThe final switch will happen when stateful jobs will be replaced with stateless ones.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThis doesn't introduce any load on stable version. On nightly version there will be `num_shards` extra jobs which will check that stateless validation results are consistent with stateful execution. But as we use nightly only for testing, it shouldn't mean much overhead.\r\n\r\nI add more fields to `ShardContext` structure to simplify code. Some of them are needed to break early if there is resharding, and the logic is the same for both kinds of jobs.\r\n\r\n`StorageDataSource::DbTrieOnly` is introduced to read data only from trie in stateless jobs. This is annoying but still needed if there are a lot of missing chunks and flat storage head moved above the block at which previous chunk was created. When state witness will be implemented, `Recorded` will be used instead.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Failure to update current_chunk_extra on the way leads to >20 tests failing in process_blocks, with errors like `assertion `left == right` failed: For stateless validation, chunk extras for block CMV88CBcnKoxa7eTnkG64psLoJzpW9JeAhFrZBVv6zDc and shard s3.v2 do not match...`\r\n* If I update current_chunk_extra only once, `tests::client::resharding::test_latest_protocol_missing_chunks_high_missing_prob` fails which was specifically introduced for that. Actually this helped to realize that `validate_chunk_with_chunk_extra` is still needed but I will introduce it later.\r\n* Nayduck: ~https://nayduck.near.org/#/run/3293 - +10 nightly tests failing,

partial mandates in chunk validator assignment.\r\n\r\nCurrently only full mandates are considered. Assume `stake_per_mandate = 5`, then:\r\n\r\n- Valdiator `V1` with stake 12 holds 2 full mandates corresponding to a stake of 10. The remaining stake of 2 does not participate in validation.\r\n- Validator `V2` with stake 4 holds 0 full mandates and does not participate in validation at all.\r\n\r\nWith support for partial mandates `V1` gets a partial mandate with weight 2 and `V2` gets a partial mandate of 4. So partial mandates allow to increase the number of validators and allows them to commit their entire stake to validation.\r\n\r\n### Probability of shard corruption\r\n\r\nIn [these simulations](https://near.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/407237-pagoda.2Fcore.2Fstateless-validation/topic/chunk.20validator.20assignment.20simulation.20with.20partial.20seats), the probability of shard corruption decreases as partial seats are included. In general, the effect of including partial seats depends on the distribution of (malicious) stake across validators and the stake required per mandate.\r\n\r\n### `ValidatorMandatesAssignment`\r\n\r\nThis type is introduced to more clearly document the result of sampling chunk validators and to avoid passing around a raw `Vec<HashMap<ValidatorId, _>>`.\r\n\r\n### Shuffling of shard ids\r\n\r\n[This thread](https://github.com/mooori/sim-validator-assignment/pull/12#discussion_r1389895314) points out a bias towards small shard ids and brings up shard id shuffling as a way to fix it. For now shard ids are not shuffled in this PR, since I think it would make the diff harder to review. I would suggest to introduce shard id shuffling in a separate PR. This should not pose a risk as chunk validator assignment is not enabled in production.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10241/reactions", "total_count": 0,

validation.\r\nI want to combine creation of necessary `StoreUpdate` with validation, because to validate `EpochSyncInfo` we need to rebuild `BlockMerkleTree` for every block in the epoch, but also not commit it if anything goes bad, and that is supported in `ChainStoreUpdate`.\r\nCreation of `StoreUpdate` is already a big change, so I want to do a separate PR for it.\r\nTo test that we process `EpochSyncInfo` correctly I create a VERY hacky test, that should not be included in CI ever. Right now it works as intended, but if we change implementation of any sync, we will have to rewrite this test.\r\nI hope I will add epoch sync into `run_sync_step` flow soon enough for us to replace this test with something stable before we need to rewrite unstable test.

An account is created at this address.\r\n2. The account does not have any access key added. Thus, it is not possible to make a transaction from this account directly.\r\n3. The Wallet Contract (as a part of the protocol) is deployed to the account. For this PR, an empty smart contract is used as a placeholder.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- On a transfer to an ETH-implicit address, if an account does not exist yet at this address:\r\n   - Create account at this address.\r\n   - Deploy a `Wallet Contract` placeholder (empty contract now) to this account.\r\n- Update fee for a transfer to an ETH-implicit address to include account creation cost. `Wallet Contract` deployment is free of charge (user only pays for an increased storage).\r\n- Tests:\r\n   - Test whether it is possible to create an ETH-implicit account by making a transfer to that address, and whether further funds can be sent to this account.\r\n   - Test that no access key is added to an ETH-implicit account (the account is locked) and in consequence no transactions are possible from this account.\r\n- Guard the changes with `EthImplicitAccounts` protocol feature and `eth_implicit_accounts` runtime config flag.\r\n\r\n## Next work\r\n- Discuss how the `Wallet Contract` should be integrated into the protocol for efficiency.\r\n- Use the `Wallet Contract` placeholder implementation that allows to transfer funds only.", "reactions": {"url":

\r\nOccasionally, the monitoring will be stuck. What happens is there are a few parts for which the process_part() is called, but never finished, i.e. not retried, not success, not failed.\r\nMy guess is that the get_part().await somehow is stuck waiting forever, and since there was no timeout bound for the process_part(), the tokio task that runs process_part could be hung forever, thus the monitoring app is stuck.\r\nI tried making the task for part_id = 100 sleep for 1000000 seconds, and the program finishes all other parts except this one and hangs. This is similar to what I see on monitoring node.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nbound process_part by a timeout, and initiate retry if timeout passed. Thus no matter for which reason the task hangs, it will retry itself.\r\n\r\nNote, the timeout is set to 10 mins because the timeout starts counting once the task is spawn, and counts real time instead of cpu time for the task, i.e. if this task is not running, time still elapse. So we need to make sure within timeout * MAX_RETRIES, we are able to finish processing all parts.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10215/reactions",

collection.\r\nThe previous version of the test was passing, because that `BlockInfo` was still in the cache of the epoch manager (as we call `is_next_block_epoch_start` on every block)\r\n\r\nImplemented safer version of `is_next_block_epoch_start` -- `is_last_block_in_finished_epoch` (didn't think too much about the name, open to suggestions).\r\n`is_last_block_in_finished_epoch` works by relying on the fact that if we processed block, and it was the last block of an epoch according to `is_next_block_epoch_start`, then we wrote an `EpochInfo` with the hash of that block, and `EpochInfo` is not garbage collectible.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/10211/reactions", "total_count":
