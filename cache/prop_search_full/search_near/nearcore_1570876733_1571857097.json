fs instead of host fs, so the change in nodelib.py is for bring the core dump into host (/tmp)\r\n\r\nTo test this by making a segment fault, easiest way is adding this to main():\r\n```\r\n    let r1

Metrics are done in two stages; Prometheus and Grafana. \r\n\r\n## Prometheus\r\n\r\nTo setup Prometheus a HTTP endpoint is require it was added as `GET /metrics` running under the configured HTTP port.\r\n\r\nEach individual metric was added to a `metrics.rs` file in the crate where it was used. These must be initialised only once and hence are wrapped in the `lazy_static` macro.\r\n\r\nWithin the code the metrics are modified through the `near-metrics` create which is a wrapper class to handle the cases where initialisation of a metric fails.\r\n\r\nStarting Prometheus with the config in `nearcore/conf/prometheus-near.yml` will tell Prometheus to hit the `GET /metrics` API which will gather all the metrics within NEAR and send them to Prometheus.\r\n\r\nRaw Prometheus can then be viewed on `localhost:9090`\r\n\r\n## Grafana\r\n\r\nGrafana needs to be setup as specified in the `METRICS.md` and will talk to Prometheus. Grafana then uses queries to make the data easier to read and interpret, in the form of graphs and figures.\r\n\r\n## Going Forward\r\n\r\nCurrently the impact of running these metrics has not been measured. I would consider wrapping them in a rust feature maybe that can be turned on or off.\r\n\r\nSome features will output 'no data points' or 'N/A' which means that the data is not being pulled from Prometheus. This is due to `lazy_static` which will only initialise an object when it is first called. Hence if a metric is never used it will not be initialised it will not have data points.\r\n\r\nIt should be relatively easy to add additional metrics by adding it to/creating a `metrics.rs` then adjusting it as required.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\np.s. Tried not to make any merge conflicts by only `cargo fmt` the files I touched but it did change a couple of other things.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/1416/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/1416/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/1410", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/1410/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/1410/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/issues/1410/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/1410", "id": 502450055, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzI0NTI4NDYx", "number": 1410, "title": "Chunk request retry", "user": {"login": "ilblackdragon", "id": 175486, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ4Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175486?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon", "html_url": "https://github.com/ilblackdragon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ilblackdragon/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-10-04T06:18:41Z", "updated_at": "2019-10-15T10:30:33Z", "closed_at": "2019-10-15T10:30:29Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/near/nearcore/pulls/1410", "html_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/1410", "diff_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/1410.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/1410.patch", "merged_at": "2019-10-15T10:30:29Z"}, "body": "When we request one part or chunk parts -
