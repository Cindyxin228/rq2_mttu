I've updated src/session.rs in the process to support the latest hyper master (they seem to have removed that parameter).\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought about passing an `&Element` to the `find_from`/`find_all_from` methods, but that would be difficult as the `Element`'s `find`/`find_from` methods must take `&mut self` to be able to call the inner `Client`, but by passing on `&self` into the `find_from` Future, they would also return an immutable borrow of self, so I went to just cloning the `Element`.\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n1. Should I remove the `#![feature(async_await)]` from lib.rs and tests/common.rs? As it's stabilized on nightly now, these raise a warning\r\n2. Any input on how I should test this? I've tried it out locally in my own project, and it worked just as expected, now I'm thinking about maybe adding a simple pre-baked HTML file to the tests and opening that in the browsers, as I can't really rely on Wikipedia's HTML staying the same forever.
