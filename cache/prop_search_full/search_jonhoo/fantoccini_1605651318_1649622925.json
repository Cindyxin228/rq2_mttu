discussion:\r\n1. A lot of methods in `fantoccini` take `&mut self` when mutable access is not required. In fact most methods should be fine with `&self`. Is this intentional?\r\n2. In order to wrap `Element` in `thirtyfour`, I needed to make its members public. Is this going to cause any issues?\r\n3. It would be nice to re-export some of the types used by `fantoccini`, so that calling crates can import (use) the exact versions without having to try to keep things in lockstep. I've add a couple of re-exports under `fantoccini::external` but feel free to suggest a better namespace. I'd also be fine with these being behind a feature flag in order to not pollute the namespace.\r\n4. I haven't yet added tests (except for `add_cookie()`).

Maybe that could help creating a better API.\r\n\r\nOne thing I wasn't able to achieve so far, is to provide a way directly pass in e.g. a `Locator` into the `on` method, and let it `Into` an appropriate function.

Cookies](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#cookies) in the WebDriver spec. In particular, I've implemented the following operations:\r\n\r\n* Get All Cookies\r\n* Get Named Cookie\r\n* Delete Cookie\r\n* Delete All Cookies\r\n\r\nThe last operation, \"Add Cookie\", requires support from the `webdriver` crate.  The primary issue is that the `AddCookieParameters` struct does not implement `Serialize`, which means that we can't build the POST request on our side.  I'll be trying to get in touch with the geckodriver folks to see if this can be changed on their end.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a new module, `cookies.rs`.  This module contains the cookie-related `Client` methods as well as a few functions for converting between raw JSON (from WebDriver) and `cookie::Cookie` for the APIs.\r\n* Added a simple integration testcase that triggers the `get_all_cookies` and `delete_all_cookies` operations.\r\n* Removed the `binary` flag/arg when creating the WebDriver test client.  Both `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` are able to detect the path to the browser binary automatically on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nCloses #59.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/130/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/130/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126", "id": 816847807, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTgwNDQwNzkz", "number": 126, "title": "Add error type for pageload timeout", "user": {"login": "leaty", "id": 4429327, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkzMjc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429327?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty", "html_url": "https://github.com/leaty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-02-25T22:07:06Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-26T08:07:41Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-26T04:29:25Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/pulls/126", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126", "diff_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-26T04:29:24Z"}, "body": "Fixes #120.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote in the issue, the error occurred when `.goto()` was used on e.g. any URL redirecting to a download, which opens a download prompt (invisible when running headless), this seems to make geckodriver return with a timeout error because the \"page\" never loaded, i.e. the download. \r\n\r\nThe error appeared after 5 minutes, which is exactly the default `pageLoad` timeout. After setting it to 5 seconds, it instead occurred *exactly* after 5 seconds. Based on this I believe this is the correct `ErrorStatus`, or at the very least this is better than dropping the connection without any ability to actually shutdown the still-alive session.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it works for me!
