the methods `StreamUnordered::iter` and `StreamUnordered::iter_pin`\r\n - Changes `Iter` and `IterPinRef`'s `Iterator::Item` type to return `(usize, _)`. The `usize` being the token of the stream.\r\n\r\nChanging the `Item` type of an existing type would be a breaking change but as far as I can tell these types were incapable of being constructed as the fields are private and no methods I could see returned it constructed hence this change shouldn't be breaking.\r\n\r\nI attempted an implementation for `StreamUnordered::iter_pin` but it's way outta my depth so this PR **is missing it's implementation.** I apologize for it not being functional but I really don't know what to do, any pointers would be appreciated and I can give it another shot.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\n\r\nI am working on a project that queues many streams into a `StreamUnordered` that are related to a single connection (effectively a websocket). When this connection is closed I need to be able to clear all active streams so it would be useful if something like the following was possible:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet streams = StreamUnordered::new();\r\n\r\n// Push some streams\r\n\r\n// Remove all streams -> collected up the tokens to avoid having a mutable and immutable reference at the same time.\r\nfor id in streams.iter().map(|(token, stream)| token).collect::<Vec<_>>() {\r\n    streams.remove(id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n - It may make sense to expose the token in a similar fashion with the mutable iterators although this would be a breaking change. I am happy to update the PR if you have guidance on how to handle this.\r\n\r\nThis would also close #4.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/streamunordered/issues/5/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/streamunordered/issues/5/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
