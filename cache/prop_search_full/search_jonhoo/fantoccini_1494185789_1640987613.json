Cookies](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#cookies) in the WebDriver spec. In particular, I've implemented the following operations:\r\n\r\n* Get All Cookies\r\n* Get Named Cookie\r\n* Delete Cookie\r\n* Delete All Cookies\r\n\r\nThe last operation, \"Add Cookie\", requires support from the `webdriver` crate.  The primary issue is that the `AddCookieParameters` struct does not implement `Serialize`, which means that we can't build the POST request on our side.  I'll be trying to get in touch with the geckodriver folks to see if this can be changed on their end.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a new module, `cookies.rs`.  This module contains the cookie-related `Client` methods as well as a few functions for converting between raw JSON (from WebDriver) and `cookie::Cookie` for the APIs.\r\n* Added a simple integration testcase that triggers the `get_all_cookies` and `delete_all_cookies` operations.\r\n* Removed the `binary` flag/arg when creating the WebDriver test client.  Both `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` are able to detect the path to the browser binary automatically on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nCloses #59.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/130/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/130/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/126/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126", "id": 816847807, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTgwNDQwNzkz", "number": 126, "title": "Add error type for pageload timeout", "user": {"login": "leaty", "id": 4429327, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkzMjc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429327?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty", "html_url": "https://github.com/leaty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leaty/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-02-25T22:07:06Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-26T08:07:41Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-26T04:29:25Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/pulls/126", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126", "diff_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/126.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-26T04:29:24Z"}, "body": "Fixes #120.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote in the issue, the error occurred when `.goto()` was used on e.g. any URL redirecting to a download, which opens a download prompt (invisible when running headless), this seems to make geckodriver return with a timeout error because the \"page\" never loaded, i.e. the download. \r\n\r\nThe error appeared after 5 minutes, which is exactly the default `pageLoad` timeout.

I've updated src/session.rs in the process to support the latest hyper master (they seem to have removed that parameter).\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought about passing an `&Element` to the `find_from`/`find_all_from` methods, but that would be difficult as the `Element`'s `find`/`find_from` methods must take `&mut self` to be able to call the inner `Client`, but by passing on `&self` into the `find_from` Future, they would also return an immutable borrow of self, so I went to just cloning the `Element`.\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n1. Should I remove the `#![feature(async_await)]` from lib.rs and tests/common.rs? As it's stabilized on nightly now, these raise a warning\r\n2. Any input on how I should test this? I've tried it out locally in my own project, and it worked just as expected, now I'm thinking about maybe adding a simple pre-baked HTML file to the tests and opening that in the browsers, as I can't really rely on Wikipedia's HTML staying the same forever. Some simple test ideas would be \"find all links inside two spans/divs\" or \"find `ul` elements and list their `li`s\".", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/56/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/56/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/53", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/53/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/53/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/issues/53/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/53", "id": 482865634, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzA5MDU0NDY3", "number": 53, "title": "Print unreachable errors received from WebDriver", "user": {"login": "evdokimovs", "id": 49490279, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDkwMjc5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49490279?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs", "html_url": "https://github.com/evdokimovs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evdokimovs/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2019-08-20T13:36:00Z", "updated_at": "2019-08-21T08:41:44Z", "closed_at": "2019-08-20T20:43:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jonhoo/fantoccini/pulls/53", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/53", "diff_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/53.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini/pull/53.patch", "merged_at": "2019-08-20T20:43:06Z"}, "body": "This PR adds printing unreachable errors which we can receive from WebDriver.\r\n\r\nSometimes WebDriver send errors which fantoccini don't expect and silently panic with `unreachable!()`.

Fields with one letter name do not give understanding to those who see the code for the first time about what they store. Also specifying PATCH version in `Cargo.toml` don't make sense because `cargo` will ignore it and automatically bump PATCH version of those crates.\r\n\r\nI added crate [serial_test_derive] for speedup your integration tests. This crate can run tests marked with `#[serial]` on one thread and other tests on multi thread. Since \"chromedriver\" can run several sessions in parallel, it is more reasonable to run tests for it in parallel, and \"geckodriver\" - in one thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n[serial_test_derive]:
