be used in most situations by user code.\r\n\r\nI chose to expose the `picky::pem` module as a first try because it is small and complex enough.\r\n\r\nNext modules to expose are:\r\n-  `picky::key`,\r\n- `picky::hash`,\r\n- `picky::jose`,\r\n- `picky::http`,\r\n-  `picky::x509`,\r\n- and `picky::ssh`.\r\n\r\nOn C# side, the last remaining bit is to write the NuGet manifest and tell where native libraries are located. I hardcoded path to `./target/debug/libpicky.so` in the `.csproj`, but we'll need to package binaries at least for x64 and x86 architectures (probably arm64 too?) for all supported platforms (Windows and Linux only? Do we support Mac as well?).\r\n\r\n`c-api`'s [README](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/tree/c03bf71e4dc6835e22f3b15e44d402f3c6f2693c/c-api) also contains a few additional

The feature is intended to be used for _SSH_ certificate authentication implementation in DVLS someday. You can find more about _SSH CA_ [here](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-ssh-certificates/), and [how to set up it](https://berndbausch.medium.com/ssh-certificates-a45bdcdfac39) This code includes the construct blocks for the _SSH_ certificate authentication, like:\r\n1. Decoding and encoding _SSH public_, private keys, and _SSH_ certificates.\r\n2. Generating _SSH_ private key and _SSH_ certificate.\r\n3. _SSH_ certificate authority in **picky-server**. \r\n**picky-server** can now issue an _SSH_ certificate by signing an _SSH_ public key. _SSH_ public keys are divided into host and client based on how the final certificate is intended to be used in an _SSH_ certificate authentication. **picky-server** contains the host and client _SSH_ private keys for signing a host public and a client public keys respective. **picky-server** private keys are stored encrypted into a **PickyStorage**. The keys are encrypted with a password that an admin can specify through _CLI_ arguments or defaults in use. I added regenerating an _SSH_ private key if a password does not match, with that password. **picky-server** new the following _REST_ endpoints:\r\n- `/ssh/sign_key` - signs an incoming _SSH_ public key. It expects _JWT_ encoded _SshSignRequest_(you can see in code how it looks like :slightly_smiling_face:) and responses with an _SSH_ certificate. \r\n- `/ssh/client_ssh_key` - responses with the public key of the client private key.\r\n- `/ssh/host_ssh_key` - responses with the public key of the host private key.\r\n\r\nYou might find the following resources useful for reviewing:\r\n[_SSH_
