This causes the `NativeReference` element to be evaluated on that platform, and MSBuild would try to link the macOS .dylib. Changing the condition to check the current TargetFramework for \"Android\" seems to work well everywhere.\r\n\r\nOn iOS, the net7.0-ios target is rolled back to net6.0-ios for better compatibility. I removed the bare .dylibs from the package - `dotnet build` seems to pick up the references at packaging time and then fails because of \"duplicate resource keys\". Since we don't use the bare .dylibs, I just removed them from the package. Next, there were build failures consuming the package in net6.0-ios and net7.0-ios targets - the linker was unable to locate the framework. For some reason, changing the packaging directory from \"ios-universal\" to \"ios\" fixes this. Since we are creating the native reference ourselves, it's not clear why it's sensitive to the RID in the path - but \"ios-universal\" was our own fabrication anyway, since there's no \"true\" universal RID(s) for Apple platforms.\r\n\r\nFinally, I incremented the version number and ported the `set-output` usages in GitHub Actions to environment files.", "reactions": {"url":

The Xamarin target is necessary to define `__IOS__` and decorate certain callbacks with the necessary attributes for AOT compilation.\r\n\r\n`Xamarin.iOS` libraries are not forward compatible with applications built using the new `net7.0-ios` target.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the managed build into two build targets. When building the regular package, both targets are included - the package is the same as it was before.\r\n\r\nOptionally, we can override the package name at build time. If building the `Devolutions.Picky.iOS` target, only the iOS build target is included and we conditionally set the target framework to `net7.0-ios`. Additionally, the \".props\" file deployed by the nuget is renamed (it must match the name of the package).\r\n\r\nThis workaround is necessary until consumers consolidate on net6/7 targets. In the future we will be able to consolidate back to a single package (and using only `dotnet build` instead of `msbuild`).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I updated the deployed .targets file to better check the current platform. When installing Devolutions.Picky in an Android project targeting `net7.0-android` on a macOS machine, the build unexpectedly picks up the macOS native reference (this issue already existed, but only becomes a problem on the new target framework(s)).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Devolutions/picky-rs/issues/190/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

`DirectoryString::BmpString` because Pku2u certificated can contain BmpString. It had been commented out. \r\n    * I've made macros exportable because I need them to deserialize new types from `picky-krb`.\r\n    * Added more OIDs.\r\n* `picky-krb`:\r\n    * Added `negoex` module that contains all new structures and data types needed for the NEGOEX protocol.\r\n    * Added `pkinit` module with implemented structures and data type needed for the PKU2U protocol.\r\n    * Added a few new structures from `MS-KILE` needed for the final authenticator generation (`KerbAdRestrictionEntry`, `LsapTokenInfoIntegrity`).\r\n    * Added new needed constants: key usages, GSS API token IDs, and checksum types.\r\n    * The `crypto` module:\r\n        * Implemented Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm that is used in Pku2u.\r\n        * Added `Checksum` trait and implement it for the `HmacSha196Aes128/256` and `HmacSha1Des3Kd`.\r\n        * Added the `Cipher::random_to_key` method that allows us to generate an encryption key from any input vector. For example, from DH shared secret. Not only from the password as it was before. Implement this method for all supported encryption types.\r\n\r\nUsed Docs & References:\r\n\r\n* [PKINIT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4556)\r\n*

This properly sets up the linker, etc, and allows us to consume the library without manually locating it and loading it first. Xamarin.Mac doesn't seem to understand the layout of the `runtimes` directory (and indeed - there is no `osx-universal` .NET RID).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the package deploys **all** native libraries for **all** platforms. This isn't an issue on Windows where RDM essentially whitelists files to be installed; however at least macOS is not selective - if a content file is included, it will be packaged in the final .app. I'm not sure about Linux but certainly this can swell the size of the final application unnecessarily. \r\n\r\nI used a static MSBuild property `IsOSPlatform` to only deploy the proper libraries; this works on Windows and macOS and should work on Linux. In the future, additional thought will need to be given for handling additional targets (`IsOSPlatform` does not have a value for Android or iOS). Possibly we could check the `runtimeid` and fallback on `IsOSPlatform` if needed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Devolutions/picky-rs/issues/172/reactions", "total_count": 0,
