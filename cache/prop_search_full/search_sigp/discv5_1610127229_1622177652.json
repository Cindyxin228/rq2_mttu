This is currently used for creating limits on IP ranges and incoming/vs outgoing nodes. \r\n- Introduces the concept of connection direction. Sessions that get established are now tagged with either being ingoing or outgoing. This can be used to limit the number of incoming connections allowed per bucket. \r\n- Improves and adds some extra filtering logic to harden the security and limit the allowed actions of malicious actors.\r\n- Keeps track of peers to ping individually. Only send pings on an interval on a per-peer basis. \r\n- Prevent counting IP votes from all peers, rather just those in the routing table.", "reactions": {"url":

[`Enr::udp_socket`](https://docs.rs/enr/0.5.0/src/enr/lib.rs.html#369-376) only returns IPv4 addresses, whilst `IpVote::majority` can return IPv6 addresses. Therefore, when the majority address is an IPv6 address it will never be the case that `Some(majority_socket) != local_socket` and node will consistently attempt to update its address but never consider it successfully updated.\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly ignores ipv6 addresses since it is my understanding that the rest of this code base is not ipv6-ready.\r\n\r\nNote: I had to run `cargo fmt --all` to appease CI.
