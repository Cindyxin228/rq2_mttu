It's memory limit can hold 10 batches.\r\n- Sorting 100 batches can be executed without issue:\r\n    - Every time 10 batches are read, mempool is full and one spill file will be written to disk\r\n    - Finally, there are 10 spill files, only one batch of each file is required to load to memory at the same time, so there is enough memory budget to do the final merging.\r\n- Sorting 49 batches fails:\r\n    - When the input is exhausted, there are 9 in-mem batches and 4 spill files. 9 + 4 batches are required to load to memory for final merging, it exceeds the memory pool limit which is around 10 batches.\r\n\r\nA common workaround I believe is to set `datafusion.execution.sort_spill_reservation_bytes` to larger, its used for extra space for merging. However, workloads' row/batch size can vary drastically, also it's possible to see the case in-memory batches has almost reached the memory limit but not yet triggered on spilling, so this parameter is very tricky to configure it correct.\r\nTo make this simpler, we can always spill the in-memory batches (if it has spilled previously) at the final stage.\r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\nChange the final sort-preserving merge logic of sorting: when it has spilled before, always spill all in-mem batches first, then start the merging phase.\r\n<!--\r\nThere is no need to duplicate the description in the issue here but it is sometimes worth providing a summary of the individual changes in this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe typically require tests for all PRs in order to:\r\n1.

close?\r\n\r\nPart of #14444.\r\n\r\nThe PR is obviously huge, but because the file are split (keeping tests in core), github doesn't understand some of the changes as moves, even though that's the majority of the change.\r\nI've read through it a couple of times and kept finding small things that can be improved and I'll probably do that again during the weekend. \r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\nMoving all format-specific functionality into dedicated crates, introducing:\r\n- `datafusion-datasource-csv`\r\n- `datafusion-datasource-json`\r\n- `datafusion-datasource-avro`\r\n- `datafusion-datasource-parquet`\r\n\r\nAlong the way I managed to move some stuff into `datasource` and tried multiple times to move tests infrastructure, but I think I ended pretty close to where I started.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThere is no need to duplicate the description in the issue here but it is sometimes worth providing a summary of the individual changes in this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\n\r\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\r\nI tried to maintain the current exposed modules and types, and keep them sane in general.\r\nI'm not sure I managed to keep all of them but I think none got significantly more complex to pull in. \r\n\r\nThere is more public API surface now, as some of the shared code used its location to stay `pub(crate)` or just private (for example - the `Decoder` trait and related pieces).\r\n\r\nAs discussed, `avro` is now fully behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\nI also moved a couple of functions from `SessionState` to session, one tiny step towards that goal.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf there are user-facing changes then we may require documentation to be updated before approving the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf there are any breaking changes to public APIs, please add the `api change` label.\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

close?\r\n\r\n- Closes #14916.\r\n\r\n## Rationale for this change\r\n\r\nWhen scanning an exact list of remote Parquet files, the ListingTable was fetching file metadata (via head calls) sequentially. This was due to using `stream::iter(file_list).flatten()`, which processes each one-item stream in order. For remote blob stores, where each head call can take tens to hundreds of milliseconds, this sequential behavior significantly increased the time to create the physical plan.\r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces the sequential flattening with concurrent merging using `stream::iter(file_list).flatten_unordered(meta_fetch_concurrency)`. With this change, the `head` requests are executed in parallel (up to the configured `meta_fetch_concurrency` limit), reducing latency when creating the physical plan.\r\nNote that the ordering loss introduced by `flatten_unordered` is perfectly acceptable as the file list will anyways be fully sorted by path in `split_files` before being returned.\r\n\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\n\r\nTests have been updated to ensure that metadata fetching occurs concurrently.\r\n\r\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\r\n\r\nNo user-facing changes besides reducing the latency in this particular situation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafusion/issues/14918/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1,

You can link an issue to this PR using the GitHub syntax.

If this is already explained clearly in the issue then this section is not needed.\r\n Explaining clearly why changes are proposed helps reviewers understand your changes and offer better suggestions for fixes.  \r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when passing a NULL value to to_char, it returns an empty string instead of NULL. [This behavior differs from PostgreSQL, Spark, DuckDb](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14884#issuecomment-2686313231), which returns NULL when given a NULL input. Aligning with common practise ensures consistency and expected behavior for users relying on SQL standards.\r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThere is no need to duplicate the description in the issue here but it is sometimes worth providing a summary of the individual changes in this PR.\r\n-->\r\nModify to_char function implementation to return NULL when the input is NULL.\r\n\r\nUpdate relevant test cases to validate the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nEnsure consistent behavior across different data types.\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe typically require tests for all PRs in order to:\r\n1.

literally. When you see plan nodes like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"project\": {\r\n  \"common\": {\r\n    \"emit\": {\r\n      \"outputMapping\": [0, 3]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe output mapping (e.g. `[0, 3]`) contains ordinals representing the offset of the target expression(s) within the [input, output] list. If the DataFusion LogicalPlanBuilder is introducing additional input expressions, this violates the plan's intent and will produce the incorrect output mappings. Please see the issue for a concrete example.\r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\n* Introduce new `add_implicit_group_by_exprs` option to the logical plan builder. It is disabled by default.\r\n   * The option is enabled _only_ in the DataFrame and SQL paths.\r\n\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a multilayer aggregation Substrait example. The first aggregation produces a unique column with a functional dependency. Despite this, the second aggregation must not introduce any additional grouping expressions.\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes in the non-Substrait paths.\r\n\r\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\r\nYes. LogicalPlanBuilder will not longer add implicity group by expressions by default. \r\n\r\nSQL, DataFrame paths remain untouched.\r\n\r\n## Appendix\r\nThis is a continuation of
