This change adopts the approach from the murmurhash implementation.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation also ignored the tail bytes. The loop at the\r\nend treats num_bytes as if it is the full length of the slice, but it\r\nisn't, num_bytes number of bytes after the last 4-byte group. This can\r\nbe observed for example by changing \"hello\" to just \"hell\" in the tests.\r\nUnder the old implementation, the test will still pass.

close?\r\n\r\nCloses #1630\r\n\r\n# Rationale for this change\r\n \r\nWe continue to have issues with various feature flag combinations resulting in compile errors. A particularly pernicious variant of this occurs you need to enable a feature of an optional dependency for tests, for example, arrow prettyprint within parquet. To do this you add the dependency as a dev-dependency, with the feature enabled. \r\n\r\nHowever, the way feature resolution traditionally works, is that even when building the library crate on its own, it would take into account features enabled by the dev-dependencies. This would mask issues with feature flags. The previous solution to this has been to have `test/dependency` crates that simply depend on the library, without the dev-dependencies.\r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7916 added an option to skip using dev-dependencies when resolving features, and this was stabilised in [feature resolver v2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-resolver-version-2) which was released in Rust 1.51. In particular with the new feature resolver\r\n\r\n> [Dev-dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies) do not activate features unless building a target that needs them (like tests or examples).\r\n\r\nThis PR therefore:\r\n\r\n* Switches to using the new feature resolver\r\n* Uses this to test different feature flag combinations in CI\r\n* Removes the old `test/dependency` workaround\r\n* Fixes the bugs this turned up\r\n\r\nThanks to @carols10cents for the pointer :heart: \r\n\r\n# Are there any user-facing changes?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1822/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1822/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1821", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1821/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1821/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1821/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1821", "id": 1265110903, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFWSkgs45Vrkg", "number": 1821, "title": "docs: remove experimental marker on C Stream Interface", "user": {"login": "wjones127", "id": 5488879, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODg4Nzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5488879?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127", "html_url": "https://github.com/wjones127", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wjones127/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2928369003, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyOTI4MzY5MDAz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/labels/arrow", "name": "arrow", "color": "2EF598", "default": false, "description": "Changes to the arrow crate"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-06-08T18:04:29Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-16T23:54:43Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-16T19:31:28Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/pulls/1821", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1821", "diff_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1821.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/1821.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-16T19:31:28Z"}, "body": "Approved by the PMC: https://lists.apache.org/thread/39wsd1y8f7fk1k44krm5jrw3pv6dnm45\r\n\r\n# Which issue does this PR close?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-16789\r\n\r\n# Rationale for this change\r\n \r\n <!---\r\n Why are you proposing this change?
