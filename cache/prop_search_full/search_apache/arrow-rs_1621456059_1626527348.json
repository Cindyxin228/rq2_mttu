Rationale for this change\r\n\r\nWe upgraded Arrow to the latest version of `rand` in https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/488 which has changed how they do js/ wasm support\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to use arrow/datafusion in IOx (which depends on both arrow and datafusion) I got this crazy error while trying to resolve dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: cyclic package dependency: package `ahash

Therefore it makes sense to build the comparator once, and re-use the returned `DynComparator` for each row you are comparing the two arrays on.\r\n\r\nDue to the explicit lifetime of `DynComparator` I recently found it problematic to store the `DynComparator` on an object that was used across threads in an async environment.\r\n\r\nBy refactoring the `build_compare` implementations I was able to remove the lifetime and it's much easier to use in the Datafusion operator I'm improving.\r\n\r\nAs a nice side-effect, the sort kernel benchmarks show an improvement in performance of around 2\u20135%.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ critcmp master pr\r\n\r\ngroup                                          master                          pr\r\n-----                                          ------                          --\r\nbool sort 2^12                                 1.03    310.8\u00b11.34\u00b5s            1.00    302.8\u00b17.78\u00b5s\r\nbool sort nulls 2^12                           1.01    287.4\u00b12.22\u00b5s            1.00    284.0\u00b13.23\u00b5s\r\nsort 2^10                                      1.04     98.7\u00b13.58\u00b5s            1.00     94.6\u00b10.50\u00b5s\r\nsort 2^12                                      1.05    510.7\u00b15.56\u00b5s            1.00    486.2\u00b19.94\u00b5s\r\nsort 2^12 limit 10                             1.05     48.1\u00b10.38\u00b5s            1.00     45.6\u00b10.30\u00b5s\r\nsort 2^12 limit 100                            1.04     52.8\u00b10.37\u00b5s            1.00     50.6\u00b10.41\u00b5s\r\nsort 2^12 limit 1000                           1.06    141.1\u00b10.94\u00b5s            1.00    132.7\u00b10.95\u00b5s\r\nsort 2^12 limit 2^12                           1.03    501.2\u00b14.01\u00b5s            1.00    486.5\u00b14.87\u00b5s\r\nsort nulls 2^10                                1.02     70.9\u00b10.72\u00b5s            1.00     69.4\u00b10.51\u00b5s\r\nsort nulls 2^12                                1.02    369.7\u00b13.51\u00b5s            1.00   363.0\u00b118.52\u00b5s\r\nsort nulls 2^12 limit 10                       1.01     70.6\u00b11.22\u00b5s            1.00     70.0\u00b11.27\u00b5s\r\nsort nulls 2^12 limit 100                      1.00     71.7\u00b10.82\u00b5s            1.00     71.8\u00b11.60\u00b5s\r\nsort nulls 2^12 limit 1000                     1.01     80.5\u00b11.55\u00b5s            1.00     79.4\u00b11.41\u00b5s\r\nsort nulls 2^12 limit 2^12                     1.05    375.4\u00b14.78\u00b5s            1.00    356.1\u00b13.04\u00b5s\r\n```\r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\nI have refactored `DynComparator` to remove the explicit lifetime. I did this by removing the need for the `DynComparator` instantiations to close over references. Instead we just move in owned arrays by cheaply cloning the underlying `ArrayData`. \r\n\r\nFurther, I took the liberty of making `DynComparator` `Send+Sync`. Again, this helps when you want to store it on types that need to be `Send + Sync`.\r\n\r\nRelative to how often the closure will be called I don't see this as an expensive change.\r\n", "reactions":

close?\r\n\r\nCloses #349 .\r\n\r\n# Rationale for this change\r\n \r\nWhen writing BOOLEAN data, writing more than 2048 rows of data will\r\noverflow the hard-coded 256 buffer set for the bit-writer in the\r\nPlainEncoder. Once this occurs, further attempts to write to the encoder\r\nfail, because capacity is exceeded but the errors are silently ignored.\r\n\r\nThis fix improves the error detection and reporting at the point of\r\nencoding and modifies the logic for bit_writing (BOOLEANS). The\r\nbit_writer is initially allocated 256 bytes (as at present), then each\r\ntime the capacity is exceeded the capacity is incremented by another\r\n256 bytes.\r\n\r\nThis certainly resolves the current problem, but it's not exactly a\r\ngreat fix because the capacity of the bit_writer could now grow\r\nsubstantially.\r\n\r\nOther data types seem to have a more sophisticated mechanism for writing\r\ndata which doesn't involve growing or having a fixed size buffer. It\r\nwould be desirable to make the BOOLEAN type use this same mechanism if\r\npossible, but that level of change is more intrusive and probably\r\nrequires greater knowledge of the implementation than I possess.\r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\n(see above)\r\n\r\n# Are there any user-facing changes?\r\n\r\nNo, although they may encounter the encoding error now which was silently ignored previously.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/443/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0,

The basic idea behind the new `ArrowArrayReader` \r\n is to copy contiguous byte slices from parquet page buffers to arrow array buffers as directly as possible, while avoiding unnecessary memory allocation as much as possible. While for primitive types such as Int32, the performance improvements are small in most cases, for complex types such as strings the performance improvements can be significant (up to 6 times faster). See benchmark results below.\r\n\r\nI did try initially to use iterators end-to-end as suggested by the linked issue, but this required a more complex and less efficient implementation which was ultimately slower. This is why in this PR iterators are only used to map parquet pages to implementations of the `ValueDecoder` trait trait which know how to read / decode byte slices for batches of values.\r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\nThis PR implements the new `ArrowArrayReader` and converters for strings and primitive types, but is only used / enabled for strings. The plan is to enable / use the new `ArrowArrayReader` for more types in subsequent PRs. Also note that `ValueDecoder`s for only `PLAIN` and `RLE_DICTIONARY` encodings are currently implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Are there any user-facing changes?\r\nThere are some non-breaking changes to `MutableArrayData` and `SlicesIterator`, @jorgecarleitao  let me know what you think about those.\r\n\r\nHere are the benchmark results:\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - old: time:   [9.0238 us 9.1121 us 9.2100 us]\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - new: time:   [6.9506 us 7.1606 us 7.4062 us]\r\n\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, optional, no NULLs - old: time:   [247.66 us 252.08 us 257.12 us]\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, optional, no NULLs - new: time:   [40.322 us 40.736 us 41.215 us]\r\n\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, optional, half NULLs - old: time:   [434.25 us 438.25 us 442.92 us]\r\nread Int32Array, plain encoded, optional, half NULLs - new: time:   [326.37 us 331.68 us 337.07 us]\r\n\r\nread Int32Array, dictionary encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - old: time:   [38.876 us 39.698 us 40.805 us]\r\nread Int32Array, dictionary encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - new: time:   [150.62 us 152.38 us 154.29 us]\r\n\r\nread Int32Array, dictionary encoded, optional, no NULLs - old: time:   [265.18 us 267.54 us 270.16 us]\r\nread Int32Array, dictionary encoded, optional, no NULLs - new: time:   [167.54 us 169.15 us 170.99 us]\r\n\r\nread Int32Array, dictionary encoded, optional, half NULLs - old: time:   [442.66 us 446.42 us 450.47 us]\r\nread Int32Array, dictionary encoded, optional, half NULLs - new: time:   [418.46 us 421.81 us 425.37 us]\r\n\r\nread StringArray, plain encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - old: time:   [1.6670 ms 1.6773 ms 1.6895 ms]\r\nread StringArray, plain encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - new: time:   [264.44 us 269.63 us 275.39 us]\r\n\r\nread StringArray, plain encoded, optional, no NULLs - old: time:   [1.8602 ms 1.8753 ms 1.8913 ms]\r\nread StringArray, plain encoded, optional, no NULLs - new: time:   [363.59 us 367.03 us 370.63 us]\r\n\r\nread StringArray, plain encoded, optional, half NULLs - old: time:   [1.5216 ms 1.5346 ms 1.5486 ms]\r\nread StringArray, plain encoded, optional, half NULLs - new: time:   [514.01 us 518.68 us 524.09 us]\r\n\r\nread StringArray, dictionary encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - old: time:   [1.4903 ms 1.5129 ms 1.5358 ms]\r\nread StringArray, dictionary encoded, mandatory, no NULLs - new: time:   [218.30 us 220.54 us 223.17 us]\r\n\r\nread StringArray, dictionary encoded, optional, no NULLs - old: time:   [1.5652 ms 1.5776 ms 1.5912 ms]\r\nread StringArray, dictionary encoded, optional, no NULLs - new: time:   [249.53 us 254.14 us 258.99 us]\r\n\r\nread StringArray, dictionary encoded, optional, half NULLs - old: time:   [1.3585 ms 1.3945 ms 1.4318 ms]\r\nread StringArray, dictionary encoded, optional, half NULLs - new: time:   [496.27 us 508.28 us 522.43 us]\r\n\r\n@nevi-me @alamb @Dandandan let me know what you think.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/384/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/384/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
