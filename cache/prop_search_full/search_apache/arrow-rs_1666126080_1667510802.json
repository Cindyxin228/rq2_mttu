(#1604)\r\n* This commit uses https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25740471/lz4-library-decompressed-data-upper-bound-size-estimation formula to estime the size of the uncompressed size. As it is said in thread, this algorithm over-estimates the size, but it is probably the best we can get with the current decompress API. As the size of a arrow LZ4_RAW block is not prepended to the block.\r\n* Other option would be to take the C++ approach to bypass the API https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/cpp/src/arrow/util/compression_lz4.cc#L343. This approach consists on relaying on the output_buffer capacity to guess the uncompress_size. This works as `serialized_reader.rs` already knows the uncompressed_size, as it reads it from the page header, and allocates the output_buffer with a capacity equal to the uncompress_size https://github.com/marioloko/arrow-rs/blob/master/parquet/src/file/serialized_reader.rs#L417. I did not follow this approach because:\r\n    1. It is too hacky.\r\n    2. It will limit the use cases of the `decompress` API, as the caller will need to know to allocate the right uncompressed_size.\r\n    3. It is not compatible with the current test logic followed by the other codecs.
