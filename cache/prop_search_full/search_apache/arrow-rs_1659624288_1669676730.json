Given this is a case where we have spilled to disk, I think this is an acceptable trade-off.\r\n\r\n_FWIW I couldn't work out a way to avoid this, as the nature of files is that their contents can be mutated by safe APIs, making it impossible to maintain an invariant over their contents_ \r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThere is no need to duplicate the description in the issue here but it is sometimes worth providing a summary of the individual changes in this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Are there any user-facing changes?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf there are user-facing changes then we may require documentation to be updated before approving the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nIf there are any breaking changes to public APIs, please add the `breaking change` label.\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3174/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3174/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3173", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3173/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3173/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3173/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/3173", "id": 1461921737, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFWSkgs5Dki0a", "number": 3173, "title": "Add `RowSelection::iter()`, `Into<Vec<RowSelector>>` and example", "user": {"login": "alamb", "id": 490673, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDY3Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/490673?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb", "html_url": "https://github.com/alamb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alamb/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2928368265, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyOTI4MzY4MjY1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/labels/parquet", "name": "parquet", "color": "E3AC42", "default": false, "description": "Changes to the parquet crate"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-11-23T15:02:29Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-23T19:04:22Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-23T18:56:08Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/arrow-rs/pulls/3173", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/3173", "diff_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/3173.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/3173.patch", "merged_at": "2022-11-23T18:56:08Z"}, "body": "# Which issue does this PR close?\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3172\r\n\r\n# Rationale for this change\r\n \r\nsee https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/3172 (Datafusion code wants to count the number of selected items)\r\n\r\n# What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\n1.
