This release includes new features, performance\nimprovements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Performance Improvements</h3>\n<p>Mypy is up to 40% faster in some use cases. This improvement comes largely from tuning the performance\nof the garbage collector. Additionally, the release includes several micro-optimizations that may\nbe impactful for large projects.</p>\n<p>Contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/18306\">18306</a></li>\n<li>PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/18302\">18302</a></li>\n<li>PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/18298\">18298</a></li>\n<li>PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/18299\">18299</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mypyc Accelerated Mypy Wheels for ARM Linux</h3>\n<p>For best performance, mypy can be compiled to C extension modules using mypyc. This makes\nmypy 3-5x faster than when interpreted with pure Python. We now build and upload mypyc\naccelerated mypy wheels for <code>manylinux_aarch64</code> to PyPI, making it easy for Linux users on\nARM platforms to realise this speedup -- just <code>pip install</code> the latest mypy.</p>\n<p>Contributed by Christian Bundy and Marc Mueller\n(PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mypyc/mypy_mypyc-wheels/pull/76\">mypy_mypyc-wheels#76</a>,\nPR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mypyc/mypy_mypyc-wheels/pull/89\">mypy_mypyc-wheels#89</a>).</p>\n<h3><code>--strict-bytes</code></h3>\n<p>By default, mypy treats <code>bytearray</code> and <code>memoryview</code> values as assignable to the <code>bytes</code>\ntype, for historical reasons. Use the <code>--strict-bytes</code> flag to disable this\nbehavior. <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0688\">PEP 688</a> specified the removal of this\nspecial case.

[x] Details are described below\r\n\r\nThe changes made are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Added the [Swatinem/rust-cache](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache) action.  \r\n   This allows us to cache dependencies and build artifacts so repeated builds can skip redownloading or recompiling crates that are unchanged.\r\n\r\n2. Added the `--skip-clean` argument to tarpaulin.  \r\n   By default, tarpaulin behaves as if `--force-clean` is set, which deletes existing build artifacts and prevents reuse of cached builds.  \r\n   With `--skip-clean`, the cached artifacts from `Swatinem/rust-cache` can be used before running tests.  \r\n   (See [Tarpaulin documentation on recompilation](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin?tab=readme-ov-file#recompilation) for details.)\r\n\r\nBelow are some CI logs from my fork that demonstrate how the caching works under different conditions:\r\n\r\n- **First CI run**  \r\n  Full build is required since there is no cache yet.  \r\n  Once complete, a cache is stored.  \r\n  [1. Link to the GitHub Actions log](https://github.com/K-dash/hudi-rs/actions/runs/12975643977/job/36186940166?pr=4)\r\n\r\n- **Second CI run (minor code changes in `crates/core/src/config/error.rs` but no new dependencies)**  \r\n  We only added a comment in the source code, so no dependencies were modified.  \r\n  This means the cached artifacts are still valid and the test build is fast.  \r\n  [2. Link to the GitHub Actions log](https://github.com/K-dash/hudi-rs/actions/runs/12975754396/job/36187193216?pr=4)\r\n\r\n- **Third CI run (added a new dependency in `python/Cargo.toml`)**  \r\n  The `python` crate is rebuilt, but other crates (`core`, `hudi`, etc.) remain cached.  \r\n  [3. Link to the GitHub Actions log](https://github.com/K-dash/hudi-rs/actions/runs/12975802004/job/36187298925?pr=4)\r\n\r\nPlease review these changes and let me know if you have any questions.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/issues/265/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/issues/265/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/issues/264", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/issues/264/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/issues/264/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/issues/264/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs/pull/264", "id": 2811296998, "node_id": "PR_kwDOL2ZwPc6I_sjs", "number": 264, "title": "feat: support reading MOR with rollback", "user": {"login": "xushiyan", "id": 2701446, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan", "html_url": "https://github.com/xushiyan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 6906710476, "node_id": "LA_kwDOL2ZwPc8AAAABm6wJzA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/labels/feature", "name": "feature", "color": "0052CC", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/milestones/3/labels", "id": 11277903, "node_id": "MI_kwDOL2ZwPc4ArBZP", "number": 3, "title": "release-0.3.0", "description": "", "creator": {"login": "xushiyan", "id": 2701446, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan", "html_url": "https://github.com/xushiyan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 69, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2024-07-05T20:02:31Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-02T17:44:37Z", "due_on": "2024-12-31T00:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2025-02-02T17:44:37Z"}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2025-01-26T03:29:37Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-26T07:20:51Z", "closed_at": "2025-01-26T07:20:44Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi-rs/pulls/264", "html_url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs/pull/264", "diff_url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs/pull/264.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi-rs/pull/264.patch", "merged_at": "2025-01-26T07:20:44Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n- Introduce `LogFileScanner` to handle reading log files.\r\n- Handle command log block for rollback\r\n\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nCloses #263\r\n\r\n<!--- Please link any related issues and PRs as well. -->\r\n\r\n## How are the changes test-covered\r\n\r\n- [ ] N/A\r\n- [x] Automated tests (unit and/or integration tests)\r\n- [ ] Manual tests\r\n  -

GitHub Action will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/wrapper\">Codecov Wrapper</a> to encapsulate the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli\">CLI</a>. This will help ensure that the Action gets updates quicker.</p>\n<h3>Migration Guide</h3>\n<p>The <code>v5</code> release also coincides with the opt-out feature for tokens for public repositories. In the <code>Global Upload Token</code> section of the settings page of an organization in codecov.io, you can set the ability for Codecov to receive a coverage reports from any source. This will allow contributors or other members of a repository to upload without needing access to the Codecov token. For more details see <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-tokens#uploading-without-a-token\">how to upload without a token</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]<br />\n<strong>The following
