This `SortExec` utilization poses a challenge, particularly in streaming environments. The inherent nature of `SortExec` demands access to the entire dataset for sorting, a requirement in conflict with the streaming model, which processes data in chunks rather than as a whole.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a table has an order like `[a ASC, b ASC]` and a lexicographical sort of `[a ASC, b ASC, d ASC]` is needed, the `d` column might be sorted without accessing the whole dataset in many practical cases.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective is to optimize the naive planner to eliminate the necessity of materializing the entire dataset with `SortExec`, especially in streaming scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\n\r\n- Added a subrule in EnforceSorting to replace SortExec with PartialSortExec if the input is unbounded and a prefix of input ordering satisfies the ordering required by the sort plan.\r\n- Implemented PartialSortExec which evaluates the segments from the input data where the segments already have the information necessary for sorting and emits the sorted segments. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThere is no need to duplicate the description in the issue here but it is sometimes worth providing a summary of the individual changes in this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe typically require tests for all PRs in order to:\r\n1.

implementing `ArrayToString` in  https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/9113 I found that many of the array functions support arbitrary combinations of arguments that are `ColumnarValue` to `Array` by converting all the arguments to arrays and then calling a function that works on arrays. \r\n\r\nI think this is a common desire when implementing functions, but it is not always clear how to do this.  \r\n\r\nFor example I think @Omega359  had to implement something similar in `to_date` in https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/9040\r\n\r\n\r\n@viirya added a helper in https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/8962 which improves the situation, but I think this function may be hard to find (it is in `datafusion_physical_expr`) and it doesn't handle the case where the arguments are a mix of `ColumnarValue::Scalar` and `ColumnarValue::Array`\r\n\r\n\r\n## What changes are included in this PR?\r\n1. Move logic to `ColumnarValue::values_to_arrays`\r\n2. Support mixed Scalar + ColumnarValues\r\n3. Add documentation\r\n4. Add unit tests\r\n5.

Move code to native.rs module (to mirror [strings.rs](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/datafusion/physical-expr/src/aggregate/count_distinct/strings.rs))\r\n1. rename native to `NativeDistinctCountAccumulator` to `PrimitiveDistinctCountAccumulator` to align with `ArrowPrimitiveType`\r\n2. add some more docs\r\n3. Remove an unecessary typedef\r\n\r\n\r\n## Are these changes tested?\r\nBy existing tests\r\n\r\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\r\nNo, this is internal code reorganization.

For example `Closes #123` indicates that this PR will close issue #123.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCloses #.\r\n\r\n## Rationale for this change\r\nIn the [#PR9034](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/9034), @viirya resolved CI error, by replacing `.remove` method of `IndexMap` with `.swap_remove` (they are equal). \r\nHowever, while reviewing I thought maybe it is better to use `.shift_remove`(where relative order is preserved after removal).\r\n\r\nAs an example, assume we have the alternative valid orderings: `[d ASC, b ASC]`, `[e ASC, f ASC]`, `[d ASC, h ASC]`,\r\nand `find_longest_permutation` is called with expressions: `d, h, e, f, b`. Conceptually any result in the following form:\r\n`[permutation(d ASC, e DESC) + permutation(b ASC, f ASC, h DESC)]` is valid. Meaning,\r\nfollowing orderings:\r\n`[d ASC, e ASC, b ASC, f ASC, h ASC]`,\r\n`[e ASC, d ASC, b ASC, f ASC, h ASC]`,\r\n`[d ASC, e ASC, f ASC, b ASC, h ASC]`,\r\n...\r\nare all valid. \r\n\r\nHowever, to not depend on any internal implementation. It is better to prefer argument ordering between permutations. e.g we want to return ordering: `[d ASC, e ASC, b ASC, f ASC, h ASC]`, for the arguments `d, h, e, f, b`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we want to return ordering: `[e ASC, d ASC, b ASC, f ASC, h ASC]`, for the arguments `e, d, h, f, b` to be consistent, and to be least surprising. \r\nReplacing `.swap_remove` with `.shift_remove` ensures this property.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Why are you proposing this change?
