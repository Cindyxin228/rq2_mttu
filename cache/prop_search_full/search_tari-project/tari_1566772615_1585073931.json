Currently it uses the achieved difficulty of a block. This means that a really strong block will make it harder for new blocks to be created. \r\n\r\nThis is not correct. On every block there is a target difficulty and if that target difficulty is achieved in a shorter or longer than expected time, the target difficulty should be adjusted up or down proportionally to the time difference. \r\n\r\nFor example (assuming very short block windows): \r\nTarget difficulty is at 100, block time 60s. A block comes in with achieved difficulty 1,000,000 at 60s. Target difficulty should not change. \r\nAnother block comes in with achieved difficulty 3,000,000, 90s after the first block. The difficulty should actually decrease to between 50-75, because the target was achieved, but in a longer time. \r\n\r\n## Consensus Changes\r\nNote the following consensus changes were made:\r\n1. The previous target difficulty is used when calculating new target difficulty. Nodes using achieved difficulty will be expecting a much higher difficulty\r\n2. The maximum block time is now part of consensus constants. Previously it was set at 6\r\n3. The target difficulty will never be less than the minimum difficulty field in consensus constants. This field always existed, but was only used for setting the initial difficulty. Alternatively we could rename it to initial difficulty, but it is useful to have a method of limiting blocks being created very quickly on an empty block chain with an old genesis block.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

If it is, it can immediately start syncing blocks without first downloading the headers.\r\nWhen it detects that a fork has occurred, it will attempt to find the split block height by downloading a set of headers from the minimum tip height to the genesis block. This can be done using only a few header bundle requests. Once the split height is determined syncing of blocks can be performed by requesting blocks by height from the split height to the network tip. Requesting blocks using hashes is no longer required as only the sync peers with the specific best chain are used for requesting blocks.\r\n- The number of headers that is requested in a single query was made configurable. \r\n- Using a single sync peer or randomly requesting blocks from different sync peers that have the best chain was made configurable.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThese changes will result in faster syncing as the number of header requests are reduced for forked block syncs and eliminated for lagging block syncs. This approach requires only basic validation to be performed on the synced headers during the block sync process.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nExisting tests cover changes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

for a lock up to occur in the messaging procotol if\r\nmany messages are sent to the same failing peer.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses unbounded mpsc channels to eliminate this possibility.\r\nSince these channels are used for outbound messaging, backpressure\r\nis less of a priority.\r\n\r\nI was not able to confirm in a unit test that bounded channels\r\ncauses a lock up, the messaging protocol performed robustly. However,\r\nlatency over a network and exponential backoff was not completely\r\nfactored in.\r\n\r\nI have changed the backoff implementation in the base node to a\r\nConstantBackoff - 1 second between retries.

Validators no longer require a copy of the blockchain db.\r\n- The previously unused check_mmr_roots was added to the full state block validator.\r\n- The consensus manager and difficulty adjustment manager was changed to rather reuse the read or write lock guard provided when calling their member functions, this allowed the blockchain backend to be removed and ensured that it did not attempt to obtain a read lock in a write lock producing a panic.\r\n- Some duplication of code was introduced in the difficulty adjustment manager to allow queries using a read and write lock guard, this should be cleaned up at a later stage.\r\n- Three validators were introduced: Validator, ValidatorWriteGuard, StatelessValidator. Validator uses a read lock guard on validation. ValidatorWriteGuard use a write lock guard on validation and  the StatelessValidator is stateless and require no lock guards,\r\n- All current validators from the blockchain db and mempool were updated to use these new validator types depending on their blockchain backend usage.\r\n- Implements for all three validator types were provided for the mock validators.\r\n- Removed the unused blockchain backend generic from the Consensus Manger, Miner and difficulty adjustment manager.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThese changes will ensure that validators reuse read and write lock guards from the blockchain db, full block validation was also restored.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nExisting tests cover changes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

large set of operations such as adding blocks or performing re-orgs. \r\n-  All functions and operations in the blockchain db were changed to allow a single read or write lock to be reused until the entire sequence of operations are complete before the lock is released.\r\n- The write function of the blockchain backend trait was changed to 'mut self' and the unnecessary locks of the lmdb backend was removed.\r\n- The full state validator is temporarily disabled until the next PR to allow the validators to reuse the read and write lock guards.\r\n- Some of the chain backend tests were updated to make use of the mut backend.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThese changes fixes an issue where different sequences of operations performed by different async tasks are interleaved and can

restarted (for whatever reason), the hidden service\r\nwould cease to exist on the tor network making it impossible for clients\r\nto connect into the node until the node is restarted.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by adding a controller that is responsible for tor\r\nhidden service reliability. If the tor control server disconnects, the \r\ncontroller will attempt to reconnect every 5 seconds until either \r\nit succeeds or is shut down. On success, clients will be able once \r\nmore to connect to the node's hidden service.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TorControlClient now has the ability to subscribe to\r\nevents emitted by the tor control server and publish those on a tokio\r\nbroadcast channel. This could be useful down-the-line for determining\r\nnetwork availability/bandwidth usage etc.\r\n\r\nThis implementation required that:\r\n1. The tor control connection is monitored in it's own task\r\n1. Events and response text is split into seperate streams\r\n1. The hidden service is immediately recovered once a connection is\r\n   reestablished.\r\n1. The event stream is preserved when reestablishing connections to tor\r\n1.

It also makes it easier to support shutdown via channels via a future PR. \r\nThe miner will now stop mining when the BN falls behind and exits listening state.\r\nThe miner can now mine multi threaded as well to better support multi core cpu's\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n* [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n* [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n* [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n* [x] Feature refactor (No new feature or functional changes, but performance or technical debt improvements)\r\n* [ ] New Tests\r\n* [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n* [x] I'm merging against the `development` branch.\r\n* [x] I ran `cargo-fmt --all` before pushing.\r\n* [x] I have squashed my commits into a single commit.\r\n* [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n* [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/1502/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/1502/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/1499", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/1499/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/1499/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/issues/1499/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/1499", "id": 582861603, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg5NzExMzY3", "number": 1499, "title": "Block sync from active peers with best chain", "user": {"login": "neonknight64", "id": 42933690, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTMzNjkw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42933690?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64", "html_url": "https://github.com/neonknight64", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neonknight64/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-03-17T09:07:12Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-21T08:42:13Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-17T13:02:25Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tari-project/tari/pulls/1499", "html_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/1499", "diff_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/1499.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/1499.patch", "merged_at": "2020-03-17T13:02:25Z"}, "body": "## Description\r\n- Modified the base node state system to allow the sharing of the current set of sync peers that have the current best network state.\r\n- Modified the chain_metadata_service to share PeerChainMetadata on its events, this includes the node_id of the peer that provided the metadata.\r\n- The base node service and outbound node interface was changed to allow requests to be sent to either a random base node or a specified peer.\r\n- The service_request_timeout test was fixed where the one node should not be reachable for the test to function correctly.\r\nThe base node state machine tests were updated to make use of the new sync peers functionality.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThese changes will allow the block syncing to only request the missing headers and blocks from a subset of peer nodes that the local node has recently been in contact with and do have the best tip on their main chain.

Description\r\n- Modified the base node state system to enter the listenings state after starting as the initial sync state was removed. The chain metadata will not be requested from neighbours but will be received from the liveness service when connections are kept alive.\r\n- Block sync was modified to make use of the received best network metadata, it no longer requests it from its peers.\r\n- The listening state was modified to keep track of a set of metadata that can be used to determine the network's best metadata. \r\n- The unused timeout system was removed from the listening state, and the unused InitialSync and BackOff was removed.\r\n- The flaky mempool timeout test was fixed. \r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThe liveness service reliably provides metadata from neighbouring nodes, if this metadata is used then it will no longer be required to request metadata from peers. These changes will simplify the state system as it can immediately enter the listening state and does not have to perform the initial sync first.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe block syncing and state system tests were updated to make use of the new compact state system.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

This did not happen when\r\nchanging to the sync peer manager. Thanks to @neonknight and\r\n@blackwolfsa who provided a test which reliably reproduces this issue.\r\n\r\nHere are my observations:\r\n\r\n1. This did not happen when using the in-memory peer db backend (presumably\r\nthat eliminates the possibility that there is a code error in peer\r\nmanager)\r\n1. Internal peer manager indexes contain the correct peer key references, however lmdb\r\n   `get` reports not to have the related peer at the given key.\r\n1. This may be related to inserting/overwriting a peer which already exists\r\n(i.e. when updating a peer)\r\n1. An exclusive sync mutex made no difference\r\n\r\nThe fix: Use tokio's async RwLock and make the peer manager interface\r\nfully async, do away with the blocking thread implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nSpurious PeerNotFound errors in tests should be eliminated. However, because we don't yet have a clear explanation of why this happened we should still be on the lookout for this bug.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nExisting tests converted to using async peer manager and pass.

private discovery messages to wallets because\r\nthey do not have the `MESSAGE_PROPAGATION` feature.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behaviour of the DHT to include wallets in\r\ndiscovery propagation messages. Internally, the Forward step of the DHT pipeline \r\nhas a special case that will propagate discovery messages to wallets. The closest peer selection \r\nhas been adjusted to allow the caller to specify the PeerFeatures of the closest nodes to target by using the `neighbours_with_features` call.\r\n_NOTE:_ because those nodes will not propagate the message further, the selection ensures \r\nthat a minimum number of propagation nodes are always selected   \r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a new example called \"memorynet\". `memorynet`, as\r\nthe name suggests, is a small in-memory DHT network consisting of a\r\nnumber of \"base nodes\" and \"wallets\" (all that differs is their feature\r\nflags).\r\n\r\nThe following happens when running `memorynet`:\r\n1. A single \"seed node\", `NUM_NODES` \"base nodes\" and `NUM_WALLETS` \"wallets\" are generated and started.\r\n1. All \"base nodes\" join the network via the \"seed node\"\r\n1. All \"wallets\" join the network via a random \"base node\"\r\n1. The first \"wallet\" in the list attempts to discover the last \"wallet\" in the list\r\n1. The result of the discovery is printed and the network is shut down\r\n\r\nThe example can be run with this command:\r\n`RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --example memorynet 2> /tmp/debug.log`\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\n\r\nCloses #1204 \r\n\r\nThe _memorynet_ example provides clean and easy to read output that allows you to easily see what is happening between a network of nodes. Each generated node is assigned a name that is used in stdout output. Normal internal logs are logged to stderr and can be switched on using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nBringing up virtual network consisting of a seed node, 15 nodes and 2 wallets\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNode 'Bob' is joining the network via the seed node 'Alice'\r\nEVENT: 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)' connected to 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)'\r\nEVENT: 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)' got inbound connection from 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)'\r\n\r\nNode 'Carol' is joining the network via the seed node 'Alice'\r\nEVENT: 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)' connected to 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)'\r\nEVENT: 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)' got inbound connection from 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)'\r\n\r\nNode 'Charlie' is joining the network via the seed node 'Alice'\r\nEVENT: 'Charlie (d4eaac42550edbd9)' connected to 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)'\r\nEVENT: 'Alice (1dc460f5fe4e3675)' got inbound connection from 'Charlie (d4eaac42550edbd9)'\r\nEVENT: 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)' connected to 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)'\r\nEVENT: 'Carol (dea46505688b5ac7)' got inbound connection from 'Bob (1d79bcc44d814748)'\r\n(snip...)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nDiscovery is done.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude0e 'Vanna' discovered peer 'Plod (7bb7b1d55953e391)' ([7bb7b1d55953e391] PK=88aed2306b39d4c4659b6a41d98199c5a8acb48155ba1e2fa6c356edece7c251 Features=NONE | COMMUNICATION_CLIENT) in 11014ms\r\n(snip...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n_memorynet_ is the primary test of these changes.
