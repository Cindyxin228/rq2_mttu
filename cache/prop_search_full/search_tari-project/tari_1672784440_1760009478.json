This creates a risk where a node operator might unknowingly run an incompatible version after consensus rule changes have already taken effect, potentially leading to network fork issues or sync problems.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis PR implements a lightweight ConsensusConstants tracking system that:\n\n1. **Stores consensus constants** on each startup in `{data_dir}/consensus_constants.json`\n2. **Compares constants** between restarts to detect changes\n3. **Validates timing** - only raises errors when new constants are already active at current blockchain height\n4. **Provides clear feedback** to users about potential network compatibility issues\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### New Components\n\n- **ConsensusConstantsTracker**: A new module that handles persistence and comparison of consensus constants\n- **Integration point**: Added to node startup flow in `builder.rs` after database initialization but before node start\n- **Minimal storage**: Only tracks essential fields needed for compatibility detection\n\n### User Experience\n\nThe implementation provides different behaviors based on the situation:\n\n- **First startup**: Silent operation, creates tracking file\n- **No changes**: Silent operation, continues normally  \n- **Constants changed, not yet active**: Info log message, continues normally\n- **Constants changed, already active**: **Critical error with clear message and exit**\n\nExample error message:\n```\nCRITICAL: Consensus constants have changed and the new constants are already active!\nCurrent height: 15000\nActive consensus constants changed from effective height 0 to 15000  \nThis indicates a potential network fork or version mismatch.\nPlease verify you are running the correct version of the node for this network.\n```\n\n### Files Changed\n\n- `base_layer/core/src/chain_storage/consensus_constants_tracker.rs` (new file, 290 lines)\n- `base_layer/core/src/chain_storage/mod.rs` (2 lines added for module export)\n- `applications/minotari_node/src/builder.rs` (15 lines added for integration)\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive unit tests covering:\n- Serialization/deserialization of consensus constants\n- Change detection logic across different scenarios\n- File persistence and loading\n- Effective height validation\n\nAll tests pass and the implementation builds successfully.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Early detection** of consensus compatibility issues before sync problems occur\n- **Clear user guidance** when potential network fork situations are detected  \n- **Minimal performance impact** - only runs once during startup\n- **Non-intrusive** - silent operation during normal circumstances\n- **Surgical implementation** - minimal code changes to existing codebase\n\nThis addresses the original issue by ensuring users are immediately notified when running a node version that may be incompatible with their current blockchain state due to consensus rule changes.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `esm.ubuntu.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `/usr/lib/apt/methods/https` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only)\n>\n> </details>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> Create a pull request to add all the minotari_node to track the ConsensusConstants it last used when starting up, versus the one it currently is using.

Previously, its internal implementation used an `RwLock` on the entire object. Consequently, every operation had to wait for the lock to be released before the next one could begin (if one of them was a write operation).\r\n\r\nFollowing recent changes, the database is no longer part of the key manager. This modification makes it possible to clone the key manager and use a separate copy in each thread.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes it explicit which operations mutate the key manager.

Instead, we expose it in two forms:\r\n\r\n1. Log_2 representation (f64) of the log_2(U512) value.\r\n\r\n2. Binary scientific notation parts (2 \u00d7 i64):\r\n   - `exp2`: `floor(log\u2082(U512 value))`\r\n   - `sig53`: top 53 bits of the U512 value, normalised to [1, 2)\r\n   - Together, these allow reconstructing an approximate U512 value with the first ~16 significant decimal digits exact: [reconstruction: `(sig53 / 2^52) * 2^exp2`].\r\n\r\nFor target difficulty (u64), we expose:\r\n\r\n1. Log_2 representation (f64) of the log_2(u64) value.\r\n\r\n2. The raw 64-bit target difficulty value (i64).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we publish the block height at which these values are sampled, lagging ~25 blocks behind the tip, to ensure stability across potential short reorgs.\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n- When using these metrics to identify chain divergences or forks, the published height must always be used as the X-axis reference to ensure correctness.\r\n- Prometheus stores all metric values as f64 (64-bit floating point). Splitting a 512-bit number into multiple gauges and expecting Grafana or Prometheus to recombine them with full precision will not work, because each gauge is still limited to f64 precision. This is why the code extracts the top 53 bits (the significand that fits in an f64) and the exponent, allowing approximate reconstruction within the limits of f64 accuracy.\r\n\r\nMotivation and Context\r\n---\r\nNot all pertinent accumulated difficulty values are currently available in metrics.\r\n\r\nHow Has This Been Tested?\r\n---\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\nWhat process can a PR reviewer use to test or verify this change?\r\n---\r\nCode review.\r\n\r\n<!-- Checklist -->\r\n<!-- 1.

Simply update your Cargo.toml:</p>\n<pre lang=\"toml\"><code>[dependencies]\ntracing-subscriber = &quot;0.3.20&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>We would like to thank <a href=\"http://github.com/zefr0x\">zefr0x</a> who responsibly reported the issue at <code>security@tokio.rs</code>.</p>\n<p>If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any tokio-rs project, please email us at <code>security@tokio.rs</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/4c52ca5266a3920fc5dfeebda2accf15ee7fb278\"><code>4c52ca5</code></a> fmt: fix ANSI escape sequence injection vulnerability (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3368\">#3368</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/f71cebe41e4c12735b1d19ca804428d4ff7d905d\"><code>f71cebe</code></a> subscriber: impl Clone for EnvFilter (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3360\">#3360</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/3a1f571102b38bcdca13d59f3c454989d179055d\"><code>3a1f571</code></a> Fix CI (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3361\">#3361</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/e63ef57f3d686abe3727ddd586eb9af73d6715b7\"><code>e63ef57</code></a> chore: prepare tracing-attributes 0.1.30 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3316\">#3316</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/6e59a13b1a7bcdd78b8b5a7cbcf70a0b2cdd76f0\"><code>6e59a13</code></a> attributes: fix tracing::instrument regression around shadowing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3311\">#3311</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/e4df76127538aa8370d7dee32a6f84bbec6bbf10\"><code>e4df761</code></a> tracing: update core to 0.1.34 and attributes to 0.1.29 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3305\">#3305</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/643f392ebb73c4fb856f56a78c066c82582dd22c\"><code>643f392</code></a> chore: prepare tracing-attributes 0.1.29 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3304\">#3304</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/d08e7a6eea1833810ea527e18ea03b08cd402c9d\"><code>d08e7a6</code></a> chore: prepare tracing-core 0.1.34 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3302\">#3302</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/6e70c571d319a033d5f37c885ccf99aa675a9eac\"><code>6e70c57</code></a> tracing-subscriber: count numbers of enters in <code>Timings</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/2944\">#2944</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/commit/c01d4fd9def2fb061669a310598095c789ca0a32\"><code>c01d4fd</code></a> fix docs and enable CI on <code>main</code> branch (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3295\">#3295</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/compare/tracing-subscriber-0.3.19...tracing-subscriber-0.3.20\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=tracing-subscriber&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.3.19&new-version=0.3.20)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

to other peers and improves connectivity overall.\r\n\r\nMotivation and Context\r\n---\r\nSome users might not want to run tor with base node so we must ensure it's still working without it.\r\n\r\nHow Has This Been Tested?\r\n---\r\nRun test cases in `peer_manager::storage::database::tests` which validates peer filtering.\r\nBuild `minotari_node` and replaced one in the Tari Universe and I have removed my node data directories including peer_db. I was able to pass bootstrap and enter header sync with 6 peers on mainnet.\r\n\r\nWhat process can a PR reviewer use to test or verify this change?\r\n---\r\nCode review, running test and same as above - run node and wait until it get some connections.\r\n\r\nAdditional check `network.log` for base node to verify if `minotari_node` was attempting to peers that had only onion address. It should dial only if address is reachable.\r\n\r\n<!-- Checklist -->\r\n<!-- 1. Is the title of your PR in the form that would make nice release notes?

The connected base node's public_key and node_id are also returned for convenience, along with the connection URL, latency and online status.\r\n  - `GetNetworkStatus` now includes a degraded status as well\r\n- Cli method `discover_peer` has been removed\r\n- All previous wallet comms config settings were deprecated (no-op), but config files were kept intact, with notices about deprecated settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n  - Wallets expose richer connectivity states (Connecting/Online/Degraded/Offline) and report latency; new RPC returns connected HTTP peer (URL, last latency, online).\n\n- **Refactor**\n  - Removed legacy DHT/Comms/SAF peer-discovery and related CLI DiscoverPeer command; connectivity now driven via HTTP-based path.\n\n- **Chores**\n  - Removed Tor/DHT dependencies and storage keys; migrations clean up obsolete comms values.\n\n- **Documentation**\n  - Updated gRPC and FFI docs; FFI config renamed to WalletDbConfig and connectivity callback now includes latency.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by

inconsistency in path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID. <strong>If you're downloading single artifacts by ID, the output path may change.</strong></p>\n<h4>What Changed</h4>\n<p>Previously, <strong>single artifact downloads</strong> behaved differently depending on how you specified the artifact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>By name</strong>: <code>name: my-artifact</code> \u2192 extracted to <code>path/</code> (direct)</li>\n<li><strong>By ID</strong>: <code>artifact-ids: 12345</code> \u2192 extracted to <code>path/my-artifact/</code> (nested)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now both methods are consistent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>By name</strong>: <code>name: my-artifact</code> \u2192 extracted to <code>path/</code> (unchanged)</li>\n<li><strong>By ID</strong>: <code>artifact-ids: 12345</code> \u2192 extracted to <code>path/</code> (fixed - now direct)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Migration Guide</h4>\n<h5>\u2705 No Action Needed If:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>You download artifacts by <strong>name</strong></li>\n<li>You download <strong>multiple</strong> artifacts by ID</li>\n<li>You already use <code>merge-multiple: true</code> as a workaround</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>\u26a0\ufe0f Action Required If:</h5>\n<p>You download <strong>single artifacts by ID</strong> and your workflows expect the nested directory structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Before v5 (nested structure):</strong></p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4\n  with:\n    artifact-ids: 12345\n    path: dist\n# Files were in:
