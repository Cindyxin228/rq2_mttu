For example if you were building a GUI application, you would expect that when calling an async function it should not be blocking the CPU & event loop whilst waiting for monitors to update. \r\nSee: https://ryhl.io/blog/async-what-is-blocking/\r\n\r\nSo we currently have problems in both:\r\n\r\n- Linux: We are correctly calling the zbus async functions, but incorrecly doing blocking filesystem operations with `std::fs`\r\n- Windows: The whole thing is blocking, since the Win32 C monitor API only provides blocking functions.\r\n\r\nI propose we fix this by having a separate blocking and async API, in the same way that many other crates do such as [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/blocking/index.html) or [zbus](https://docs.rs/zbus/latest/zbus/blocking/index.html).\r\n\r\nHaving a blocking API is also much more convenient / ergonomic for users who are not intending to run within an async context.  \r\n\r\nI recommend running `cargo doc` locally to get a quick overview of the changes!\r\n\r\n(Note: I've tested the Windows side, but not the Linux side as I don't have a suitable device setup at the moment)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stephaneyfx/brightness/issues/10/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stephaneyfx/brightness/issues/10/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
