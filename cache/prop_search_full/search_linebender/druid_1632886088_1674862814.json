The `resvg` crate pins `png` to `=0.17.6`. The way cargo works, this means that no other crate that Druid uses, or even any project that uses Druid can use any other semver compatible `png` version.\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: failed to select a version for `png`.\r\n    ... required by package `piet-common v0.6.1`\r\n    ... which satisfies dependency `piet-common = \"^0.6.1\"` of package `druid v0.7.0`\r\n    ... which satisfies path dependency `druid` (locked to 0.7.0) of package `book_examples v0.1.0`\r\nversions that meet the requirements `^0.17.7` are: 0.17.7\r\n\r\nall possible versions conflict with previously selected packages.\r\n\r\n  previously selected package `png v0.17.6`\r\n    ... which satisfies dependency `png = \"=0.17.6\"` of package `resvg v0.28.0`\r\n    ... which satisfies dependency `resvg = \"^0.28.0\"` of package `druid v0.7.0`\r\n    ... which satisfies path dependency `druid` (locked to 0.7.0) of package `book_examples v0.1.0`\r\n\r\nfailed to select a version for `png` which could resolve this conflict\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus I think the solution here is to revert back to `resvg` v0.25 which is just a few months older, but has a much saner `png` dependency of `^0.17`. This issue has been brought to the attention of `resvg` in [resvg#571](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/issues/571) where they confirm their intention to change this in the future. For now I don't think we should propagate that pin to all projects depending on Druid.

contains an icon resource with id 1, this icon will be used in the Taskbar and in the titlebar of Druid windows. If there is no such icon resource, the default application icon IDI_APPLICATION will be used (as before this change).\r\n\r\nAdding a custom icon: one way is to use the [winres] crate and follow the guide in its README; `winres::WindowsResource::set_icon()` adds an icon with id 1.\r\n\r\nNon-Windows back-ends are not modified.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is a very small change that improves on status-quo a little; it is not an attempt in adding proper support for icons. The new behavior is a strict superset of the previous behavior and should have no negative effects. The users that do not take special steps to embed a Windows icon won't be affected.\r\n\r\n### What happens if there is no icon resource #\u20601?\r\n\r\nIt will fall back to use the standard icon `IDI_APPLICATION`, matching the original behavior without this PR.\r\n\r\n1. `LoadIconW` will [return][LoadIconW] `NULL`:\r\n    _If the function fails, the return value is NULL_.\r\n2. `WNDCLASSW::hIcon`, being `NULL`, [causes][WNDCLASSW] Windows to use a default icon:\r\n    _If this member is NULL, the system provides a default icon._\r\n\r\nI was unable to find any document that explicitly says that the default icon is `IDI_APPLICATION`, but in practice it has been this way since Windows 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Why use the hard-coded icon id #\u20601?\r\n\r\nThe icon used by Windows for the executable file (in Explorer etc) is the first icon resource in the resource section. It does not have to be specifically #\u20601, but it is a common practice to use #\u20601 for the application icon, because the Resource Compiler orders icons by id and using 1 guarantees it to be the first one.\r\n\r\nAlso, one of the convenient methods of adding an icon to a Rust binary, the [winres] crate, uses the id #\u20601 by default.\r\n\r\nI think this justifies the use of a hard-coded id in this case. This PR is intended as a very small change and any additional complexity wouldn't be welcome. Also, this will be superseded by a proper support for window icons, if and when it arrives in Druid (something like `WindowDesc::set_icon`).\r\n\r\n\r\n[LoadIconW]:

with floats or such in the future.

The most questionable one is `CustomCursor` in `druid-shell` I guess, but for now it works.\r\n* [`type-complexity`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#type-complexity) - This lint got a lot more aggressive. The lint may get tweaked, pending conclusion of [rust-clippy#9299](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/9299). Until then I just increased our complexity tolerance threshold.\r\n* [`duplicate_mod`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#duplicate_mod) - Apparently we have a delibrate hack of duplicate mod import, so I just disabled this lint until we can remove the hack.\r\n* [`needless_return`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#needless_return)\r\n* [`get_first`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#get_first)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2244/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2244/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2239", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2239/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2239/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2239/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2239", "id": 1325111103, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCUkQWc48d4u0", "number": 2239, "title": "Turn on raw-win-handle for most of the clippy checks.", "user": {"login": "jneem", "id": 1448113, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDgxMTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1448113?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem", "html_url": "https://github.com/jneem", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-08-01T23:50:33Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-25T12:37:00Z", "closed_at": "2022-08-02T23:12:35Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/pulls/2239", "html_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2239", "diff_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2239.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2239.patch", "merged_at": "2022-08-02T23:12:35Z"}, "body": "Just doing the PR to test CI.

The problematic object in question here is a string returned by [`stringByAppendingPathExtension`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1412501-stringbyappendingpathextension) and the Apple documentation for that mentions nothing.\r\n\r\nThe best I found was an [old comment on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4354184/138826) which claims that *The convention is that a method should autorelease any object it returns. The only exception (AFAIK) is for constructors*. Looking at our existing macOS code, both `alloc` and `new` seem to require releasing. Are there others? Would be nice to know for future code reviews.\r\n\r\nRight now though, it seems clear that `stringByAppendingPathExtension` sets up `autorelease` by itself, so we don't need to do it.\r\n\r\nBefore the change in this PR, on macOS 10.15.4, I get `objc[484]: NSPathStore2 object 0x7f852fb2ed50 overreleased while already deallocating; break on objc_overrelease_during_dealloc_error to debug`. After this change, the warning disappears.\r\n\r\nI am going to assume, based on the stack trace provided, that this will also resolve the segfault reported in #2209. @SamuelMarks could you please test if this resolves the segfault you're seeing?\r\n\r\nFixes #2209.\r\n\r\nPS. This PR also contains a pre-emptive robustification by replacing a few `NSString` allocations/releasings with the util function we already have for that.", "reactions": {"url":

But I wanted to get other main points across with this draft PR.*~~\r\nAddressed all `todo`s. \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2172/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2172/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2169", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2169/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2169/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/issues/2169/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2169", "id": 1210460780, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCUkQWc42h9kT", "number": 2169, "title": "Silence clippy.", "user": {"login": "jneem", "id": 1448113, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDgxMTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1448113?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem", "html_url": "https://github.com/jneem", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jneem/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-04-21T03:53:27Z", "updated_at": "2022-04-21T18:41:44Z", "closed_at": "2022-04-21T18:41:43Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/linebender/druid/pulls/2169", "html_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2169", "diff_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2169.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2169.patch", "merged_at": "2022-04-21T18:41:43Z"}, "body": "I'm not 100% sure about the naming of `to_string`, which seems pretty overloaded.
