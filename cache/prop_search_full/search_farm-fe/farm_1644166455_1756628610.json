This ensures that during project creation, both the library definition and its usage will consistently use the project name provided by the user.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the Farm development experience by ensuring consistency across the generated project, making the code more intuitive and maintainable for users.\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes changes to multiple template files in the `create-farm-rs` crate to standardize the library name used in the `main.rs` files. The library name has been replaced with a placeholder `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib` to ensure consistency across different templates.\r\n\r\nChanges to standardize library names:\r\n\r\n* [`crates/create-farm-rs/templates/tauri2/preact/src-tauri/src/main.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-343c2f4290acc7717373f75d00a1975ea99f04d7bdce19c2e876e5e7099ff1d3L5-R5): Replaced `preact_lib::run()` with `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib::run()`.\r\n* [`crates/create-farm-rs/templates/tauri2/react/src-tauri/src/main.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-343c2f4290acc7717373f75d00a1975ea99f04d7bdce19c2e876e5e7099ff1d3L5-R5): Replaced `react_lib::run()` with `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib::run()`.\r\n* [`crates/create-farm-rs/templates/tauri2/solid/src-tauri/src/main.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-343c2f4290acc7717373f75d00a1975ea99f04d7bdce19c2e876e5e7099ff1d3L5-R5): Replaced `solid_lib::run()` with `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib::run()`.\r\n* [`crates/create-farm-rs/templates/tauri2/svelte/src-tauri/src/main.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-343c2f4290acc7717373f75d00a1975ea99f04d7bdce19c2e876e5e7099ff1d3L5-R5): Replaced `svelte_lib::run()` with `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib::run()`.\r\n* [`crates/create-farm-rs/templates/tauri2/vanilla/src-tauri/src/main.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-343c2f4290acc7717373f75d00a1975ea99f04d7bdce19c2e876e5e7099ff1d3L5-R5): Replaced `vanilla_lib::run()` with `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib::run()`.\r\n* [`crates/create-farm-rs/templates/tauri2/vue/src-tauri/src/main.rs`](diffhunk://#diff-343c2f4290acc7717373f75d00a1975ea99f04d7bdce19c2e876e5e7099ff1d3L5-R5): Replaced `vue_lib::run()` with `<FARM-TEMPLATE-NAME>_lib::run()`.<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request!
