`~1.1.0` version requirement. As a consequence, quite a few crates still have `lazy_static` 1.1.0 in their dependency tree. That particular version regresses with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65819, as `array.into_iter()` is used in the build script. [This report says](https://gist.github.com/LukasKalbertodt/a4ad46ca391dcc134c349100880c884c) that `lazy_static` 1.1.0 causes roughly 800 other crates to regress. \r\n\r\nIdeally all crates would upgrade to a newer `lazy_static`, but that might now happen. Therefore my idea: release `1.1.1` with this tiny change. It does not require a newer Rust compiler version and fixes a bunch of crates. What do you think?\r\n\r\n(PS: the PR targeting `master` is obviously wrong. I just wanted to create this PR for some discussion about this. If everyone agrees we should release `1.1.1`, I can manually \"merge\" this into the main repo)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/162/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/162/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/159", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/159/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/159/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/159/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/pull/159", "id": 524779097, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzQyNDkxNjI5", "number": 159, "title": "Update examples for 2018 edition", "user": {"login": "AndyGauge", "id": 6525150, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjUxNTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6525150?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge", "html_url": "https://github.com/AndyGauge", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyGauge/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-11-19T05:13:51Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-23T21:04:19Z", "closed_at": "2020-01-13T07:34:08Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/pulls/159", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/pull/159", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/pull/159.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/pull/159.patch", "merged_at": "2020-01-13T07:34:08Z"}, "body": "Don't run 1.27.2 doc examples (based off #134)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/159/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/159/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
