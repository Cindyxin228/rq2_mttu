Besides getting us to think outside\r\nthe box, I hope that we can deprecate `cargo update` and replace it with\r\n`cargo upgrade`.  To build up a case to justify the ecosystem churn, we\r\nneed to get run time with the expected behavior to see how it works.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior is\r\n- Only upgrade compatible dependencies by default\r\n- Users may pass in `--incompatible` or `--pinned` to upgrade others to incompatible versions\r\n- Users may pass in `--compatible false` to exclusive upgrade incompatible versions when used with another flag\r\n\r\nThis is disruptive to existing cargo-edit users though.  So why\r\nmove away from the traditional behavior?\r\n\r\nReason 1: The new model for `cargo upgrade` is \"what if `cargo update` updated the\r\nmanifest to match the lock file\".  `cargo update` only deals with\r\ncompatible upgrades and it would be disruptive to that common workflow\r\nto deal with incompatible upgrades (ie exacerbate ecosystem churn)\r\n\r\nReason 2: There are several workflows we are trying to cover that\r\ninvolve needing to upgrade only a subset of dependencies.  Before, we\r\nhad been working under the assumption of incompatible-by-default which\r\nrequired ways to opt-out which have been a bit awkward.\r\nCompatible-by-default provides a simple way of supporting most documented\r\nworkflows\r\n- Application authors who want the latest features and bug fixes can get\r\n  it with a simple `cargo upgrade -i`\r\n- Users who want to defer breaking changes can do so by leaving off\r\n  `--incompatible` or having it but using it with `--exclude`\r\n- For maintainers who want isolated PRs, they can either run `cargo upgrade` and then `cargo upgrade --incompatible` or, if they don't want data races, can do `cargo upgrade` and then `cargo upgrade --incompatible --compatible false`\r\n- Library authors who want to keep their compatible versions low will run `cargo upgrade --incompatible --compatible false`\r\n- Checking for any upgrade is `cargo upgrade --locked --incompatible` and checking for only incompatible upgrades is `cargo upgrade --locked --incompatible --compatible false`\r\n\r\nIn getting here, we considered several other alternatives, including\r\n- Compatible by default without an opt-out.  This was what this PR initially did until I wrote p the use cases and realized there was a gaping hole.  The new behavior has the appearance of this old behavior but with an opt-out\r\n- Provide `--no-compatible` which feels out of place and awkward to tack\r\n  on\r\n- Make `--compatible` the default if no flags are specified but\r\n  otherwise make the flags additive (`cargo upgrade` would upgade\r\n  compatible but `cargo upgrade --incompatible` wouldn't and would\r\n  require `cargo upgrade --incompatible --compatible`).  This feels like\r\n  it'd be too confusing\r\n- Make `--compatible` the default but make all flags mutually exclusive.\r\n  This makes the specifying-a-specific case short but requires running\r\n  2-3 times to cover multiple cases.  Road humps in the users workflow\r\n  like this are frustrating.\r\n\r\nOther reasons I went with the current approach\r\n- While it adds some awkward ceremony to some cases, it works well for composing in scripts or with aliases\r\n- Its consistent with `--recursive`\r\n- Cargo already uses optional values else where (`cargo check --features`)\r\n  - Its safest when there are no positional arguments which cargo usually avoids (`cargo add` being an exception)\r\n\r\nOther behavior change\r\n- Pinned dependencies will now get compatible version upgrades\r\n- The dependency table go some clean up\r\n- The `--help` output got some clean up\r\n- Maintaining the version req syntax now has higher precedence than compatible upgrades (since we don't support upgrading all version req syntaxes)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/killercup/cargo-edit/issues/804/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,

team meeting and [zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/246057-t-cargo/topic/Stablizing.20cargo-add) we've discussing the fact that `cargo`s version of `cargo add` would conflict with `cargo-edit`s and ideally we insta-stable the command because of it.  To be least disruptive, we'd be full feature parity, so we want to insta-stable everything.\r\n\r\nAfter looking over `cargo install`s flags and their behavior, it seems like we could start with matching that and then add to both whatever we want later.  Keep in mind that there are key differences.  `cargo install` runs in effectively isolated mode while `cargo add` is sensitive to the workspace its running in.\r\n\r\nThis gets us most of the way to cargo-install.  We just aren't supporting adding multiple crates from a source or inferring a single crate from the source.", "reactions": {"url":
