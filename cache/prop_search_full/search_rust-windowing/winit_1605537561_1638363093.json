Press `esc` twice to close the first two windows\r\n> 2. Press `alt`+`F`. The window goes into exclusive fullscreen\r\n> 3. Press `F`. The window seems to change to borderless fullscreen which is indicated by the fact that I can use `cmd`+`tab` to switch between applications. But now the menu bar isn't shown.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since I [first looked at this issue](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1326#issuecomment-933350528), I've added a fix for the following path:\r\n\r\nRunning `cargo run --example multithreaded`:\r\n1. Press `F`. The window goes into borderless fullscreen.\r\n2. Press `alt`+`F`. The window goes into exclusive fullscreen\r\n3. Press `F`. The window returns to borderless fullscreen. At this point the menu bar should appear normal and the green 'resize' button should be active.\r\n\r\nI assume that there are further edge cases to consider that I haven't found, the logic here is a bit thorny and it can be hard to keep track of all the options and modes, but for the main cases this seems to be working correctly, at least in my testing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on all

As described in the documentation, this method steals focus from other applications and should be used with care. Even though this method can cause quite a disruptive user experience I do believe winit should provide the option to users of this crate as valid use cases exist. Once #1764 has been merged, documentation could be expanded to redirect users to `request_user_attention` for a less disruptive way of getting attention to a window.\r\n\r\nDecided to call it `focus_window` but the name could be changed for more clarity. Some APIs, like `set_minimized`, have a boolean parameter for toggling the, in this case, \"minimized\" state. For `focus_window` I decided not to do that as \"unfocusing\" is quite strange, like, where does the focus go? Also deliberately made the choice to \"ignore\" `focus_window` on minimized and not visible windows for improved user experience.\r\n\r\nDon't have a Linux X11 machine at my disposal so the implementation might/is probably incorrect.\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on Windows\r\n- [x] Tested on macOS  \r\n- [ ] Tested on X11\r\n- [x] `cargo fmt` has been run on this branch\r\n- [x] `cargo doc` builds successfully\r\n- [x] Added an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users\r\n- [x] Updated documentation to reflect any user-facing changes, including notes of platform-specific behavior\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1944/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1944/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1941", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1941/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1941/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1941/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1941", "id": 892728283, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjQ1MzU3Mzkx", "number": 1941, "title": "Remove support for `stdweb`", "user": {"login": "maroider", "id": 54416743, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE2NzQz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54416743?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider", "html_url": "https://github.com/maroider", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maroider/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 924436465, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5MjQ0MzY0NjU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/labels/DS%20-%20web", "name": "DS - web", "color": "FBCA04", "default": false, "description": "Affects the Web backend (WebAssembly/WASM)"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2021-05-16T18:19:48Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-03T16:57:03Z", "closed_at": "2021-05-24T17:06:21Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/pulls/1941", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1941", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1941.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1941.patch", "merged_at": "2021-05-24T17:06:21Z"}, "body": "- [ ] Tested on all platforms changed\r\n- [x] Compilation warnings were addressed\r\n- [x] `cargo fmt` has been run on this branch\r\n- [x] `cargo doc` builds successfully\r\n- [x] Added an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users\r\n- [x] Updated documentation to reflect any user-facing changes, including notes of platform-specific behavior\r\n- [x] Created or updated an example program if it would help users understand this functionality\r\n- [x] Updated [feature matrix](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/FEATURES.md), if new features were added or implemented\r\n\r\nWe have now had two releases of Winit (`0.24` and `0.25`) with the `stdweb` backed marked as deprecated (see #1662 and #1712).

Consequently we might want to warn API users when they try use one of these \"reserved `ident`s\" (but only on the thread looper set up by `ndk-glue`s `init()` function)?\r\n\r\nCC @dvc94ch @msiglreith \r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on all platforms changed\r\n- [x] Compilation warnings were addressed\r\n- [x] `cargo fmt` has been run on this branch\r\n- [x] `cargo doc` builds successfully\r\n- [ ] Added an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` if knowledge of this change could be valuable to users\r\n- [ ] Updated documentation to reflect any user-facing changes, including notes of platform-specific behavior\r\n- [ ] Created or updated an example program if it would help users understand this functionality\r\n- [ ] Updated [feature matrix](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/FEATURES.md), if new features were added or implemented\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1826/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1826/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1820", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1820/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1820/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1820/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1820", "id": 782627390, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTUyMTQ0OTQ1", "number": 1820, "title": "Android: Do not mark unhandled events as handled.", "user": {"login": "alula", "id": 6276139, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzYxMzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6276139?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula", "html_url": "https://github.com/alula", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alula/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 474349996, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw0NzQzNDk5OTY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/labels/DS%20-%20android", "name": "DS -

then restore when user is relaunching your application - this is not possible for maximized window state at all. We have `Window::set_maximized` and `WindowBuilder::with_maximized` - but no way to query current state. Current maximized state can be changed outside of API (e.g. users clicking on maximize button in window frame).\r\n\r\nTested on Windows and macOS. This should probably be supported for Wayland/X11 - but I am not too familiar with the API and could not figure out how to implement it. Marked linux API as not implemented and set it to always return `false` for now. Maybe some linux platform maintainers could help get this functionality covered under this platform as well?\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on all platforms changed\r\n(only Windows and macOS)\r\n- [x]

The original issue was here https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3214 , as you can see in a log, DPR from winit is 718, which is literally insane. I see 2 options on how to fix such issues.\r\n\r\n1 - Make winit compute DPI only if a randr value in use, otherwise return just 1 all the time. Qt is probably doing something similar IIRC\r\n2 - Just try to ignore odd values (this PR is doing it).\r\n\r\nThe proposed `1` change is a breaking change, so I guess `2` option should fix some problems right now, however I feel like we should also implement `1` at some point to be more `native`, since auto DPI adjustments aren't something common for X11.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1403/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1403/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
