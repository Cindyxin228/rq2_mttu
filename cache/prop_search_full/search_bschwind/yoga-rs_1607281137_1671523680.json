This PR is to prepare for a release of the newly updated code:\r\n\r\n- Upgrades all dependencies to latest versions (no code changes were required)\r\n- Adds `CHANGELOG.md` documenting changes\r\n- Updates version number in `Cargo.toml`. I figured that a minor version bump was warranted here as I think we updated the yoga version by about 4 years.\r\n\r\nI wasn't quite sure if I should update the patch versions of dependencies. I think it probably doesn't make a lot of difference as I believe cargo will consider patch versions semver-compatible and choose the patch version it wants to regardless of the patch version we

benchmarking against Yoga, and this library would seem to be the obvious way to do it. However, it only seems fair to benchmark against the latest version of yoga. So I thought I'd try to see how hard it was to update (not that hard).\r\n\r\n- Upgrades yoga to commit [`35f3335efc88efced75aa1db1bb379cf0872831a`](https://github.com/facebook/yoga/commit/35f3335efc88efced75aa1db1bb379cf0872831a), which was the latest on the main branch as of 15th December 2022\r\n- Adds new `YGPositionStatic` variant to `YGPosition` enum (especially important because it's added to the start of the enum, renumbering the other variants)\r\n- Adds the Guttter type which maps to the new `YGGutter`\r\n- Adds `set_row_gap`, `get_row_gap`, `set_column_gap`, `get_column_gap`, `set_gap`, and `get_gap` functions to allow setting and getting gutters using (`YGNodeStyleSetGap` and `YGNodeStyleGetGap`).\r\n- Upgrades codebase to 2021 edition and fixes cargo warnings.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 21 tests failing, which I haven't dug into too deeply. They all seem to be to do with absolute position, and they seem to be returning `NaN` which isn't great.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/54/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bschwind/yoga-rs/issues/54/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
