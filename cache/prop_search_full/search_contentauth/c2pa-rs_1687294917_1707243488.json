This allows unit testing the new pdf_io module without having to read entire PDF files into memory. Let me know what you think! We've been using this on the services and really enjoying how it makes unit testing easier. \n\n## Checklist\n- [x] This PR represents a single feature, fix, or change.\n- [x] All applicable changes

strongly that this should be completely opt-in, since many place we will be integrating this library will have built-in or more efficient graphics libraries available. Additionally, just including this feature increases the size of any dylibs we build from this due to the inclusion of the `image` crate.\r\n- **Removes `Send` from the `CAIRead` trait when building for Wasm** - We aren't supporting WebAssembly Threads yet, and this is causing more complexity than we currently need in this environment. We are leaving it in for anything that gets compiled to C since we do want it when passing asset data across tokio-managed threads.\r\n- **Expose `CAIRead` and `CAIWrite` traits** - It seemed like these traits weren't exposed publicly (the `asset_io` module is `pub(crate)`, so I had to expose these to be able to implement them in JavaScript/Wasm.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] This PR represents

and the `pdf_utils::C2paPdf` trait, public (to the crate), `lopdf` abstractions with functionality to read and write manifest data from PDFs. This code works against `wasm` and `non-wasm` targets.\r\n\r\nI intend to add read support next, then round out the work with incremental update support. I opened this PR against `origin/pdf` instead of `main` as I want to get this in front of folks before getting to far and this work doesn't support reading manifests or incremental PDF updates. \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] This PR represents a single feature, fix, or change.\r\n- [x] All applicable changes have been documented.\r\n- [x] Any `TO DO` items (or similar) have been entered as GitHub issues and the link to that issue has been included in a comment.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/249/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/249/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/141", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/141/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/141/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/141/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/pull/141", "id": 1392586530, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHWi6Qc4_8jbF", "number": 141, "title": "(MINOR) User, UserCbor and Uuid assertions removed from SDK", "user": {"login": "gpeacock", "id": 1124693, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMjQ2OTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1124693?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock", "html_url": "https://github.com/gpeacock", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gpeacock/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-09-30T15:08:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-13T22:02:38Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-13T22:02:37Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/pulls/141", "html_url": "https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/pull/141", "diff_url": "https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/pull/141.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/pull/141.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-13T22:02:37Z"}, "body": "## Changes in this pull request\nRemove User, UserCbor and Uuid assertions from the public SDK\nUse add_labeled_assertion instead.\n## Checklist\n- [ ] This PR represents a single feature, fix, or change.\n- [ ] All applicable changes have been documented.\n- [ ] Any `TO DO` items (or similar) have been entered as GitHub issues and the link to that issue has been included in a comment.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/141/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues/141/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
