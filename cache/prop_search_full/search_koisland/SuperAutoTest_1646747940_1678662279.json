`.saptest.toml` to disable graphs for performance. \r\n* Added team names to `SapDB` from the [Team Names SAP wiki page](https://superautopets.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Names).\r\n* Added random generation of team names for `Team`.\r\n* Added `team` field to `Pet`.\r\n* Added `sold` field to `Team` to store sold pets.\r\n* Added condition in `Team::fight()` that prevents `Team`s with identical names from fighting.\r\n    * This is necessary for building the digraph. \r\n* Changed `Team::clear_team()` to retain empty slots in middle of friends and push up the first pet if empty slots ahead of it.\r\n* Changed certain `Action` like the `Experience` and `Profit` variants to take args so `Multiple` not required.\r\n* Changed `Clone` impl for `Team` adds \"_copy\" suffix so each team always has a unique name.\r\n* Changed `TeamEffects::trigger_effects()` to be only for pet effects. Split item effects into `TeamEffects::trigger_items()`.\r\n* Fixed `Team::restore()` to not invalidate previous `Pet` references.\r\n* Fixed bug where new `Tiger` abilities from `repeat_effects_if_tiger()` were not mapped to the effect pet causing the effects to be invalid.\r\n* Fixed bug in battle effect order where which side invoked `Team::fight()` would alter the battle outcome.\r\n   *  `lhs.fight(rhs) != rhs.fight(lhs)`\r\n   * Fixed by correctly changing triggers to deplete by the team with the lowest attack pet at the front. Also fixed so item effects activate last.\r\n* Removed some hard-coded actions like `Action::Tapir` and `Action::Vulture` with `Action::Conditional` actions.\r\n* Removed `id` arg for `Pet::new()` as unique `Pet` ids are now required.\r\n* Updated docs and benchmarks.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/koisland/SuperAutoTest/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":
