This allows a system to request multiple queries without the user having to construct them themselves.

between each run of the system, allowing for some level of caching between runs.\r\n\r\nFor example, prior to this PR:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[system]\r\n#[read_component(A, B)]\r\n#[write_component(C)]\r\nfn my_system(world: &mut SubWorld) {\r\n    let query_a = <(&A, &mut C)>::query();\r\n    for (a, c) in query_a.iter_mut(world) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    let

some of which are breaking.\r\n\r\n- `Canon` is moved out of `Registry` so that it's now a free-standing type. That way there's a clear separation of concerns, between handling `Entity` and handling component types.\r\n- The `with_entity_serializer` methods on `WorldSerializer` and `WorldDeserializer` are consequently removed, while `World::as_serializable` and `Registry::as_deserialize(_into_world)` take an extra `EntitySerializer` argument.\r\n- `Canon` now handles its locking internally, instead of having to be wrapped in a lock.\r\n- `CustomEntitySerializer`'s methods take `&self`, possible due to the change above.\r\n- `EntitySerializer` now has a blanket implementation for anything that implements `CustomEntitySerializer`.\r\n- The custom `run_as_context` logic is replaced with the [`scoped-tls-hkt`](https://github.com/Diggsey/scoped-tls-hkt) crate, which does this more cleanly and is better-tested.\r\n- The `ENTITY_SERIALIZER` variable, introduced by the change above, is made public and documented. This fixes #228.\r\n\r\nI think that the `EntitySerializer` and `CustomEntitySerializer` traits could do with better names, but I've held off on that as I can't think of names that really work well.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/230/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/230/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/223", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/223/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/223/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/issues/223/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/legion/pull/223", "id": 754537048, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTMwNDIwNDgz", "number": 223, "title": "Add Legion brand", "user": {"login": "dawnlarsson", "id": 61861940, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYxODYxOTQw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61861940?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson", "html_url": "https://github.com/dawnlarsson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dawnlarsson/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2730606048, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNzMwNjA2MDQ4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/legion/labels/type:%20maintenance", "name": "type: maintenance", "color": "84b6eb", "default": false, "description": "A task that has no noticeable user-facing effect.
