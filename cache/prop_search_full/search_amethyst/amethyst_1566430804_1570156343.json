This means that\r\nall tilemap allocation must occur on a 2^n boundary on the correct dimensions boundary.

Description\r\n\r\nscreen_to_world was incorrect for perspective cameras. Additionally, the naming conventionand data provided was insufficient really for proper 3d screen raycasting. \r\n\r\nThis adds screen_ray(), screen_to_world_point(), and a Ray struct  for their use.\r\nThis allows users to get a proper Ray from the screen, as well as get projected\r\npoints along this ray.  These functions are camera agnostic.\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n\r\n- `renderer::Ray` structure.\r\n- `Camera::screen_ray()`\r\n- Caches the inverse of the projection matrix as an optimization, accessible via `as_inverse_matrix()`\r\n## Modifications\r\n\r\n- `Camera::screen_to_world` renamed `Camera::screen_to_world_point`. Now takes a Point3, where the z-level is the distance from the ray origin (camera)\r\n- `as_matrix_mut` changed to `set_matrix` and no mutable references can be obtained.\r\n\r\n## PR

This is both an intro and a tiny patch.\r\n\r\n## Background / Intro\r\n\r\nI'm using Amethyst (right now only `amethyst_core`) for a browser-based game written in Typescript and Rust. Along with `stdweb` it feels like a match made in heaven, and every day I'm more impressed by both Rust and Amethyst-spawned crates. \ud83d\ude0d Rendering is shelled out to `THREE.js` for now, until `wgpu-rs` or Amethyst are ready for WASM prime-time. Anyway, I figured I would hijack this PR to say hello \ud83d\udc4b and **inquire as to the WASM plan/timeline for Amethyst**. For example, Amethyst (including `core`) pulls in `rayon` directly but treading support isn't there just yet. I'm happy to help anywhere work overlaps! I'll need a few bleeding-edge things like a half decent UDP stack (so `WebRTC`). Would rather my efforts went to something shared than a private code base, if that's ever possible.\r\n\r\nYou're all awesome, keep up the great work \ud83c\udf7b\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThreading support isn't there yet for browsers, and causes a panic when you try to use a `shred::DispatcherBuilder`:\r\n_`backend.js:1 Panic error message: Invalid configuration: ThreadPoolBuildError { kind: IOError(Custom { kind: Other, error: \"operation not supported on wasm yet\" }) }`_\r\n\r\nThis PR continues piping the ability to disable parallel support in `shred` up through `amethyst_core` so that WASM consumers (like me) can disable it.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nBy placing an x in the boxes I certify that I have:\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated the content of the book if this PR would make the book outdated.\r\n- [x] Added a changelog entry if this will impact users, or modified more than 5 lines of Rust that wasn't a doc comment.\r\n- [x] Added unit tests for new code added in this PR.\r\n- [x] Acknowledged that by making this pull request I release this code under an MIT/Apache 2.0 dual licensing scheme.\r\n\r\nIf this modified or created any rs files:\r\n\r\n- [x] Ran `cargo +stable fmt --all`\r\n- [x] Ran `cargo clippy --all --features \"empty\"`\r\n- [x] Ran `cargo test --all --features \"empty\"`\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1907/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1907/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1905", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1905/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1905/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1905/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/1905", "id": 485019211, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzEwNzQ1MDAx", "number": 1905, "title": "Maintain examples Readme", "user": {"login": "piedoom", "id": 8846211, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDYyMTE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8846211?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom", "html_url": "https://github.com/piedoom", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/piedoom/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2019-08-26T03:00:28Z", "updated_at": "2019-08-27T02:59:22Z", "closed_at": "2019-08-26T21:20:44Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/pulls/1905", "html_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/1905", "diff_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/1905.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/1905.patch", "merged_at": "2019-08-26T21:20:44Z"}, "body": "This will update all screenshots in our current examples README.md file, which have become outdated.

adds the amethyst_tiles subcrate, which provides efficient 2D (and 3D!) tile maps and rendering functionality. The crate provides a `TileMap` struct, which stores underlying `Tile` types in a flat `Vec` storage (could be extended later to more efficient/different storage types). An `Encoder` type is also provided, which performs coordinate encoding into the flat space, allowing for efficient storage and iteration. Region iterator helpers are also included, and can be seen in the render pass. \r\n\r\nFinally, a WIP example is completed at `examples/tiles`. I'd like to include some more complex iteration and access of the tile map before release.\r\n\r\nThis code has a lot of unit tests.\r\n\r\nFeatures included: \r\n- `RenderTiles2D` render plugin, which is implemented in `DrawTiles2D` transparency pass.\r\n- `Tile` trait, which is used to implement a tile data type. This is for abstracting away the storage type from the rendering, and allows for efficient storage (a u8 which returns a tile index) to complex storage (an entire struct complex type)\r\n- An `Encoder` trait, which allows for implementing different space filling algorithms for efficient  tile storage and iteration. Default is `MortonEncoder2D`, which implements morton encoding on each Z level. Currently provided are `MortonEncoder`, which is morton encoding across Z-levels, and `HilbertEncoder`, which implements hilbert space filling across Z-levels.\r\n\r\nWIP - If something looks very obviously out of place (like a Cargo.toml entry), I probably haven't cleaned it up yet or am experimenting quickly with it.\r\n\r\nCreated #1858 for further documentation work.\r\n\r\n## Modifications\r\n\r\n- I had to make a change to camera gatherers in the `gather` submodule of rendy to fetch only the `Entity` I wanted.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nBy placing an x in the boxes I certify that I have:\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated the content of the book if this PR would make the book outdated.\r\n- [ ] Added a changelog entry if this will impact users, or modified more than 5 lines of Rust that wasn't a doc comment.\r\n- [x] Added unit tests for new code added in this PR.\r\n- [x] Acknowledged that by making this pull request I release this code under an MIT/Apache 2.0 dual licensing scheme.\r\n\r\nIf this modified or created any rs files:\r\n\r\n- [x] Ran `cargo +stable fmt --all`\r\n- [x] Ran `cargo clippy --all`\r\n- [x] Ran `cargo test --all --features \"empty\"`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1820/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amethyst/amethyst/issues/1820/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
