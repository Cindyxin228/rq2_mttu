/Users/zgotsch/projects/jsgrep/Cargo.lock` when trying to run `cargo docset`. I didn't look too deep into why the parse was actually failing, but I upgraded cargo and it started working.\r\n\r\nI also ran `cargo fmt`, which stripped out a lot of trailing commas as is specified in your config. I tried to put most of those changes in a separate commit so you can review stuff more easily.\r\n\r\nThanks for building this!
