When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or

I'm building a scratch container, meaning it only contains the statically linked binary and nothing else. One of my dependencies uses hyper-rustls as a dependency with the default features. As a result, (a) rustls-native-certs returns an empty `RootCertStore` without flagging that there might be an issue, (b) when hyper tries to connect through the `Connector`, it fails with a `webpki::Error::UnknownIssuer`. And, this doesn't happen when testing outside the containerized environment, but fails inside the container.\r\n\r\nI feel like something should probably generate an error or panic if this happens, but I'm not sure which level of the stack is most appropriate. Since the return value of `rustls_native_certs::load_native_certs()` is technically correct, I feel like the problem here is in how hyper-rustls tries to abstract over the differences.\r\n\r\nThe solution implemented here is to have hyper-rustls panic if `Connector::new()` doesn't find any trust anchors; since it can already panic when it is unable to access a native cert store, this seems like an okay solution. Alternatively, maybe `rustls_native_certs::load_native_certs()` should return an error if it doesn't find anything? This is technically correct but not very useful behavior.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rustls/hyper-rustls/issues/125/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":
