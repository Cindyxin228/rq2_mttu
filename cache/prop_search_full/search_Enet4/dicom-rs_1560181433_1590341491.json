This means that data may still need to be copied around in some cases (e.g. saving a DICOM object to disk), and that each data token has to be fully contained in memory. This is likely to be reiterated to address the concerns presented in #1, so that tokens may instead borrow or refer to an arbitrary reader source.", "reactions": {"url":

them here:\r\n\r\n- substantially changed the parser and printer abstractions to be become _stateful_ decoder and encoder abstractions, thus being easier to understand their purpose and behaviour:

useful implementations of it (including for the in-memory DICOM object type and for the file meta table).\r\n- new experimental `dicom_value!` macro for constructing primitive values of variable cardinality.\r\n- the method `RootDicomObject.write_to_file(path)` lets you write a complete DICOM object to disk.", "reactions": {"url":

This allows implementations to be generic over the source/target while enabling object safe consumption.\r\n- Changed some methods in encoder traits to expose the concrete number of bytes that were written\r\n- Remove erased decoder: it was not useful\r\n- Reorganized the data set reading and writing into its own module in the parser crate: `dataset`\r\n- Add a `Printer` type; for the lack of a better name, this one is the dual to the `DicomParser` type, and is a stateful encoder which admits proper text encoding.\r\n- Add a data set writer type in the parser crate\r\n- Multiple bugs in the
