It is included in the\ndefault feature set, or else can be enabled like any other Cargo feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>&quot;serde-1&quot;</code> feature has been removed, leaving just the optional\n<code>&quot;serde&quot;</code> dependency to be enabled like a feature itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>IndexMap::get_index_mut</code> now returns <code>Option&lt;(&amp;K, &amp;mut V)&gt;</code>, changing\nthe key part from <code>&amp;mut K</code> to <code>&amp;K</code>. There is also a new alternative\n<code>MutableKeys::get_index_mut2</code> to access the former behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The new <code>map::Slice&lt;K, V&gt;</code> and <code>set::Slice&lt;T&gt;</code> offer a linear view of maps\nand sets, behaving a lot like normal <code>[(K, V)]</code> and <code>[T]</code> slices. Notably,\ncomparison traits like <code>Eq</code> only consider items in order, rather than hash\nlookups, and slices even implement <code>Hash</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> now have <code>sort_by_cached_key</code> and\n<code>par_sort_by_cached_key</code> methods which perform stable sorts in place\nusing a key extraction function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> now have <code>reserve_exact</code>, <code>try_reserve</code>, and\n<code>try_reserve_exact</code> methods that correspond to the same methods on <code>Vec</code>.\nHowever, exactness only applies to the direct capacity for items, while the\nraw hash table still follows its own rules for capacity and load factor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Equivalent</code> trait is now re-exported from the <code>equivalent</code> crate,\nintended as a common base to allow types to work with multiple map types.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>hashbrown</code> dependency has been updated to version 0.14.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>serde_seq</code> module has been moved from the crate root to below the\n<code>map</code> module.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.9.3</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump the <code>rustc-rayon</code> dependency, for compiler use only.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.9.2</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> both implement <code>arbitrary::Arbitrary&lt;'_&gt;</code> and\n<code>quickcheck::Arbitrary</code> if those optional dependency features are enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.9.1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MSRV now allows Rust 1.56.0 as well. However, currently <code>hashbrown</code>\n0.12.1 requires 1.56.1, so users on 1.56.0 should downgrade that to 0.12.0\nuntil there is a later published version relaxing its requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

closed).</li>\n<li>Workaround an issue where <code>rustls</code> TLS backend expected domain in a certain format and reject IPv6 addresses if they contained square brackets in them.</li>\n<li>Update dependencies and remove unused errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.18.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update dependencies (underlying <code>tungstenite</code> core).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make <code>Origin</code> header case-sensitive (to keep compatibility with poorely-written servers that don't accept lowercase <code>Origin</code> header).</li>\n<li>Make semantics of the reading form the <code>WebSocketStream</code> more reasonable (return <code>None</code> instead of an error when the stream is normally closed).</li>\n<li>Imrpove the way <code>poll_close()</code> works by properly driving the close of the stream till completion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the <code>tungstenite</code> dependency (fixes a panic in <code>tungstenite</code> and MSRV), see <a href=\"https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0172\"><code>tungstenite</code>'s changelog for more details</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the

<code>connect()</code> like logic.</li>\n<li>Add support for choosing the right root certificates for the TLS.</li>\n<li>Change the behavior of the <code>connect()</code> so that it fails when using TLS without TLS feature.</li>\n<li>Do not project with Unpin.</li>\n<li>Update the dependencies with important <a

details</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.14.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for <code>rustls</code> as TLS backend.\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>tls</code> feature was renamed to <code>native-tls</code> and uses a OS-native TLS implementation.</li>\n<li>A new <code>native-tls-vendored</code> feature that uses <code>native-tls</code> but forces to build a vendored\nversion (mostly for <code>openssl</code>) instead of linking against the system installation.</li>\n<li>New <code>rustls-tls</code> feature flag to enable TLS with <code>rustls</code> as backend.</li>\n<li><code>stream::Stream</code> was renamed to <code>MaybeTlsStream</code> and wraps a <code>rustls</code> TLS stream as well now.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

version.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-rs/releases\">redis's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.23.0</h2>\n<p>This release adds the <code>cluster_async</code> module, which introduces async Redis Cluster support. The code therein is largely taken from <a href=\"https://github.com/Marwes\"><code>@\u200bMarwes</code></a>'s <a href=\"https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-cluster-async\">redis-cluster-async crate</a>, which itself appears to have started from a sync Redis Cluster mplementation started by <a href=\"https://github.com/atuk721\"><code>@\u200batuk721</code></a>. In any case, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Marwes\"><code>@\u200bMarwes</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/atuk721\"><code>@\u200batuk721</code></a> for the great work, and we hope to keep development moving forward in <code>redis-rs</code>.</p>\n<p>This release also adds support for Rustls, a long-sought feature. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/rharish101\"><code>@\u200brharish101</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/LeoRowan\"><code>@\u200bLeoRowan</code></a> for getting this in! Note that the <code>tls</code> and <code>async-std-tls-comp</code> features have been deprecated and replaced by <code>tls-native-tls</code> and <code>async-std-native-tls-comp</code>, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though async Redis Cluster functionality for the time being has been kept as close to the originating crate as possible, previous users of\n<code>redis-cluster-async</code> should note the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retries, while still configurable, can no longer be set to <code>None</code>/infinite retries</li>\n<li>Routing and slot parsing logic has been removed and merged with existing <code>redis-rs</code> functionality</li>\n<li>The client has been removed and superceded by common <code>ClusterClient</code></li>\n<li>Renamed <code>Connection</code> to <code>ClusterConnection</code></li>\n<li>Added support for reading from replicas</li>\n<li>Added support for insecure TLS</li>\n<li>Added support for setting both username and password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix long-standing bug related to <code>AsyncIter</code>'s stream implementation in which polling the server\nfor additional data yielded broken data in most cases. Type bounds for <code>AsyncIter</code> have changed slightly,\nmaking this a potentially breaking change.

Using the certificate is left to the caller (no serializing, no updating the resolver, etc).\r\n* A new simplified (no caching, no `spawn`ed TLS update loop) 443 listener was added\r\n* The Http01 port 80 listener was made public\r\n\r\nThe following shared state structures were also made public\r\n* `AcmeClient` - used by `issue_cert` but may be shared across invocations\r\n* `ResolveServerCert` - used by `issue_cert`, `issue_cert` caller, and 443 listener\r\n* http01 key map - used by `issue_cert`, 80 listener\r\n\r\nAnd some other helper functionality was exposed, methods for avoiding transitive deps, etc.\r\n\r\nThere's an example showing the usage (just showing the parallel to the fully poem-managed ACME http01 process).  I believe it's minimal: there's not a lot of boilerplate and exposed functions and objects have clear uses, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to rename/reorg things, improve comments if things are unclear, or if there are other changes needed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/poem-web/poem/issues/494/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/poem-web/poem/issues/494/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
