<code>Sink</code> for the <code>WebSocketStream</code>, so it does not return an error when it\u2019s not necessary (when <code>poll_flush()</code> is called on a connection that has just been closed).</li>\n<li>Workaround an issue where <code>rustls</code> TLS backend expected domain in a certain format and reject IPv6 addresses if they contained square brackets in them.</li>\n<li>Update dependencies and remove unused errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.18.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update dependencies (underlying <code>tungstenite</code> core).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.2</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make <code>Origin</code> header case-sensitive (to keep compatibility with poorely-written servers that don't accept lowercase <code>Origin</code> header).</li>\n<li>Make semantics of the reading form the <code>WebSocketStream</code> more reasonable (return <code>None</code> instead of an error when the stream is normally closed).</li>\n<li>Imrpove the way <code>poll_close()</code> works by properly driving the close of the stream till completion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the <code>tungstenite</code> dependency (fixes a panic in <code>tungstenite</code> and MSRV), see <a href=\"https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0172\"><code>tungstenite</code>'s changelog for more details</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the dependencies, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0170\"><code>tungstenite</code> changelog</a> for the actual changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.16.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix feature selection problem when using TLS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.16.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a function to allow to specify the TLS connector when using <code>connect()</code> like logic.</li>\n<li>Add support for choosing the right root certificates for the TLS.</li>\n<li>Change the behavior of the <code>connect()</code> so that it fails when using TLS without TLS feature.</li>\n<li>Do not project with Unpin.</li>\n<li>Update the dependencies with important <a href=\"https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0160\">implications / improvements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.15.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the <code>tungstenite-rs</code> version to <code>0.14.0</code>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0140\">check <code>tungstenite-rs</code> release for more details</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.14.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for <code>rustls</code> as TLS backend.\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>tls</code> feature was renamed to <code>native-tls</code> and uses a OS-native TLS implementation.</li>\n<li>A new <code>native-tls-vendored</code> feature that uses <code>native-tls</code> but forces to build a vendored\nversion (mostly for <code>openssl</code>) instead of linking against the system installation.</li>\n<li>New <code>rustls-tls</code> feature flag to enable TLS with <code>rustls</code> as backend.</li>\n<li><code>stream::Stream</code> was renamed to <code>MaybeTlsStream</code> and wraps a <code>rustls</code> TLS stream as well now.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

By simply adding the wildcard (*) to your CORS configuration, you can enable cross-domain requests for all subdomains of a given domain. I replaced the `HashSet::contains` search with a Regex containing all the domains (example:https://regex101.com/r/ZEhBy4/2).  I'm aware of `the allow_origin_fn`, but in opinion this is ergonomic.  The PR is almost ready to be merged only need a review of the `unwrap` used.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is welcome.

version.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-rs/releases\">redis's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.23.0</h2>\n<p>This release adds the <code>cluster_async</code> module, which introduces async Redis Cluster support. The code therein is largely taken from <a href=\"https://github.com/Marwes\"><code>@\u200bMarwes</code></a>'s <a href=\"https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-cluster-async\">redis-cluster-async crate</a>, which itself appears to have started from a sync Redis Cluster mplementation started by <a href=\"https://github.com/atuk721\"><code>@\u200batuk721</code></a>. In any case, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Marwes\"><code>@\u200bMarwes</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/atuk721\"><code>@\u200batuk721</code></a> for the great work, and we hope to keep development moving forward in <code>redis-rs</code>.</p>\n<p>This release also adds support for Rustls, a long-sought feature. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/rharish101\"><code>@\u200brharish101</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/LeoRowan\"><code>@\u200bLeoRowan</code></a> for getting this in! Note that the <code>tls</code> and <code>async-std-tls-comp</code> features have been deprecated and replaced by <code>tls-native-tls</code> and <code>async-std-native-tls-comp</code>, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though async Redis Cluster functionality for the time being has been kept as close to the originating crate as possible, previous users of\n<code>redis-cluster-async</code> should note the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retries, while still configurable, can no longer be set to <code>None</code>/infinite retries</li>\n<li>Routing and slot parsing logic has been removed and merged with existing <code>redis-rs</code> functionality</li>\n<li>The client has been removed and superceded by common <code>ClusterClient</code></li>\n<li>Renamed <code>Connection</code> to <code>ClusterConnection</code></li>\n<li>Added support for reading from replicas</li>\n<li>Added support for insecure TLS</li>\n<li>Added support for setting both username and password</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix long-standing bug related to <code>AsyncIter</code>'s stream implementation in which polling the server\nfor additional data yielded broken data in most cases. Type bounds for <code>AsyncIter</code> have changed slightly,\nmaking this a potentially breaking change.

progress.\r\n\r\nBasically this exposes `issue_cert` along with the surrounding necessary structures, methods, etc. I made the following big changes:\r\n\r\n* `issue_cert` was made public and its responsibilities were restricted to _only_ completing the ACME procedure.  Using the certificate is left to the caller (no serializing, no updating the resolver, etc).\r\n* A new simplified (no caching, no `spawn`ed TLS update loop) 443 listener was added\r\n* The Http01 port 80 listener was made public\r\n\r\nThe following shared state structures were also made public\r\n* `AcmeClient` - used by `issue_cert` but may be shared across invocations\r\n* `ResolveServerCert` - used by `issue_cert`, `issue_cert` caller, and 443 listener\r\n* http01 key map - used by `issue_cert`, 80 listener\r\n\r\nAnd some other helper functionality was exposed, methods for avoiding transitive deps, etc.\r\n\r\nThere's an example showing the usage (just showing the parallel to the fully poem-managed ACME http01 process).  I believe it's minimal: there's not a lot of boilerplate and exposed functions and objects have clear uses, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to rename/reorg things, improve comments if things are unclear, or if

header case-sensitive (to keep compatibility with poorely-written servers that don't accept lowercase <code>Origin</code> header).</li>\n<li>Make semantics of the reading form the <code>WebSocketStream</code> more reasonable (return <code>None</code> instead of an error when the stream is normally closed).</li>\n<li>Imrpove the way <code>poll_close()</code> works by properly driving the close of the stream till completion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.17.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the <code>tungstenite</code> dependency (fixes a panic in <code>tungstenite</code> and MSRV), see <a

TLS without TLS feature.</li>\n<li>Do not project with Unpin.</li>\n<li>Update the dependencies with important <a

TLS implementation.</li>\n<li>A new <code>native-tls-vendored</code> feature that uses <code>native-tls</code> but forces to build a vendored\nversion (mostly for <code>openssl</code>) instead of linking against the system installation.</li>\n<li>New <code>rustls-tls</code> feature flag to enable TLS with <code>rustls</code> as backend.</li>\n<li><code>stream::Stream</code> was renamed to <code>MaybeTlsStream</code> and wraps a <code>rustls</code> TLS stream as well now.</li>\n<li>If both <code>native-tls</code> and <code>rustls-tls</code> are enabled <code>native-tls</code> is used by default.</li>\n<li>A new <code>Connector</code> was introduced that is similar to the previous <code>TlsConnector</code> but now allows\nto control the used TLS backend explicitly (or disable it) in <code>client_async_tls_with_config</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.13.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade from Tokio 0.3 to Tokio
