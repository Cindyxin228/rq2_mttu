It is included in the\ndefault feature set, or else can be enabled like any other Cargo feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>&quot;serde-1&quot;</code> feature has been removed, leaving just the optional\n<code>&quot;serde&quot;</code> dependency to be enabled like a feature itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>IndexMap::get_index_mut</code> now returns <code>Option&lt;(&amp;K, &amp;mut V)&gt;</code>, changing\nthe key part from <code>&amp;mut K</code> to <code>&amp;K</code>. There is also a new alternative\n<code>MutableKeys::get_index_mut2</code> to access the former behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The new <code>map::Slice&lt;K, V&gt;</code> and <code>set::Slice&lt;T&gt;</code> offer a linear view of maps\nand sets, behaving a lot like normal <code>[(K, V)]</code> and <code>[T]</code> slices. Notably,\ncomparison traits like <code>Eq</code> only consider items in order, rather than hash\nlookups, and slices even implement <code>Hash</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> now have <code>sort_by_cached_key</code> and\n<code>par_sort_by_cached_key</code> methods which perform stable sorts in place\nusing a key extraction function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> now have <code>reserve_exact</code>, <code>try_reserve</code>, and\n<code>try_reserve_exact</code> methods that correspond to the same methods on <code>Vec</code>.\nHowever, exactness only applies to the direct capacity for items, while the\nraw hash table still follows its own rules for capacity and load factor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Equivalent</code> trait is now re-exported from the <code>equivalent</code> crate,\nintended as a common base to allow types to work with multiple map types.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>hashbrown</code> dependency has been updated to version 0.14.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>serde_seq</code> module has been moved from the crate root to below the\n<code>map</code> module.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.9.3</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump the <code>rustc-rayon</code> dependency, for compiler use only.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.9.2</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>IndexMap</code> and <code>IndexSet</code> both implement <code>arbitrary::Arbitrary&lt;'_&gt;</code> and\n<code>quickcheck::Arbitrary</code> if those optional dependency features are enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.9.1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MSRV now allows Rust 1.56.0 as well. However, currently <code>hashbrown</code>\n0.12.1 requires 1.56.1, so users on 1.56.0 should downgrade that to 0.12.0\nuntil there is a later published version relaxing its requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
