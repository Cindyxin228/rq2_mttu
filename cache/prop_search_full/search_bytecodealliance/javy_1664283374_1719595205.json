Even though there are no known issues with this approach, `__JS_FreeValueRT` is an internal method and no guarantees are made regarding its stability, therefore it's preferred to avoid relying on it. Without this custom patch, I'm observing locally, on average a 2% increase in fuel usage outside of the 10% acceptable variance. Note that there are safe mechanisms in place to mitigate the impact of GC in the codebase, namely: (i) using `ManuallyDrop` where possible (ii) setting the GC threshold to `-1` to reduce the possibility of any GC pauses. With that in mind, the 2% increase seems reasonable given all the benefits that we get from this change.\r\n\r\nAlternatives considered:\r\n\r\n* Keeping the fork\r\n  * Upgrades will be difficult\r\n  * There's no easy way of publishing the `javy` crate\r\n* Post-processing the generated Wasm code and make `JS_FreeValue` and `JS_FreeContext` no-op.\r\n  * This worked to a certain extent, however, in my opinion, the result is not worth the effort. This approach resulted in minimal performance improvements. Even though `JS_FreeValue` which is a method from the public API and is invoked by Rust `drop`s will end up calling `__JS_FreeValueRT`, which is the most expensive of the `free` variants, not all `__JS_FreeValueRT` invocations stem from `JS_FreeValue`, some of them happen automatically from within the JS code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've updated the relevant CHANGELOG files if necessary.

Namely:\r\n\r\n* Usage of SIMD JSON in order to speed up `JSON.parse` and using `serde_json` in order to speed up `JSON.stringify`. \r\n* Introduction of `Javy.JSON` functions as helpers to work with the stdin and stdout file descriptors. These are non-standard and live at the `Javy` namespace for that reason. These APIs should be considered unstable, meaning that there's no guarantee that they'll live in-tree forever, the intention is to move these away once our extensibility story is polished. \r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nThe usage of the more performant JSON functions (based on SIMD and serde_json) *requires* enabling the QuickJS JSON intrinsic (see the config.rs module).  The reason behind this decision is to enable: a compliant JSON implementation that is optimized for the  hotpath: if extra arguments are passed to either JSON.{parse,stringify}, the native parse/stringify functions will be invoked, keeping the standard functionality. \r\n\r\nI believe that the best way to test this would be to run JSON 262 tests, to ensure that the implementation is fully compliant. However, this is not included in this PR. Such change is better packed on its own pull-request. I'll follow up with a change that includes a way to run JSON 262 tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've updated the relevant CHANGELOG files if necessary. Changes to `javy-cli` and `javy-core` do not require updating CHANGELOG files.\r\n- [x] I've updated the relevant crate versions if necessary. [Versioning policy for library crates](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/blob/main/docs/contributing.md#versioning-for-library-crates)\r\n- [x] I've updated documentation including crate

by rquickjs.\r\n\r\nThis change has several objectives:\r\n\r\n- Refactor the structure of the Config and its relationship with the Runtime to pave the way for a truly extensible and configurable engine. The way Intrinsics are exposed in rquickjs simplifies (i) enabling a granular configuration experience of the native intrinsics, which was not entirely clear how to achieve before, and (ii) adding custom APIs as intrinsics.\r\n \r\n- Enhance how our configuration operates: the previous model assumed an almost static configuration setup, allowing only limited, non-straightforward customizability from the CLI in the future. This was mostly modeled per API and not as a global aspect of the runtime. Our recommended approach for users needing functionality beyond what was provided was to fork or recreate their own version of the CLI/APIs. A telling sign of this issue is that the configuration parameters were almost never used in any of the APIs. This PR paves the way for greater extensibility, which will be facilitated by threading configuration options from the CLI in a follow-up PR; this method will also allow for opting-in to non-standard functionality via a CLI flag, helping us avoid issues like the one noted here: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/issues/628.\r\n\r\nAlong the way,  I had to make several changes to make all this work; the most relevant ones  are: (i)  deprecating the `javy-apis` crate (ii) enabling all the APIs by default and (iii) reworking a bit the `Console` implementation. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning to deprecate the `javy-apis` crate is mostly around: (i) the fact that we're revamping our extensilbity model in the near fuiture and (ii)  the complexity around cyclical dependencies:  `javy` exposes rquickjs and given that the cofiguration is tied to the runtime, `javy` needed to depend on `javy-apis` but the other way around was also true. I decided not to spend too much cycles on this mostly given point (i) above. \r\n\r\nThere are still things to follow-up on after this PR, namely \r\n\r\n- [ ] Update all the documentation under  `docs` \r\n- [ ] A PR to thread the engine configuration from the CLI. **NB that the engine behaviour is not  altered in this PR.**\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've updated the relevant CHANGELOG files if necessary.

Symbols are excluded because they crashed on Javy 2.x and throw an exception with this branch (from this [QuickJS line](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs/blob/01454caf78bcc928dfab1ca62a551fe92ada4d4c/quickjs.c#L11724)).

At the same time, we get to leverage QuickJS' implementation just like we did prior to the introduction of the rquickjs bindings.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to re-implement printing each types, thus choosing a string representation for each type. If we want to go that route, we have to choose wether we want to follow what other engines do (more work, slower), or stick with Javy's current minimal approach.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- ~[ ] I've updated the relevant CHANGELOG files if necessary.

When the project started, there were very limited options for bindings that could work for our use-case and more importantly, bindings that would compile to `wasm32-wasi`. That said, bindings under this project are \"good enough\" for Javy, but they are probably not the most ergonomic for use-cases that require more complex interactions with QuickJS.\r\n\r\nThe Rust <> QuickJS landscape has changed in the past few years, which means that it's probably a good time to reconsider our initial decisions.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes migrating to `rquickjs` and dropping support for `quickjs-wasm-rs` and `quickjs-wasm-sys`. The `rquickjs` bindings are more ergonomic and enable more natural interactions between Rust and QuickJS' API. \r\n \r\nWith the adoption of `rquickjs`, we'd be able to address issues like: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/issues/605, https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/issues/608, https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/pull/617 and https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/pull/611. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is divided in a series of commits, but it's better reviewed as a whole, given that I didn't put enough thought to make each commit self-contained.\r\n\r\nIn general, this change doesn't introduce any functional changes, dropping support for `quickjs-wasm-rs` is the only breaking change introduced by this PR. The only exception is that I fixed a bug in our number deserialization process, in which the implementation was not respecting the `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER..=MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` range. \r\n\r\nThis change is already big as-is; I'm planning on creating follow-up PRs for:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Updating the documentation under `docs`\r\n- [ ] Update the READMEs for `quickjs-wasm-rs` and `quickjs-wasm-sys` with a deprecation notice.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've updated the relevant CHANGELOG files if necessary. Changes to `javy-cli` and `javy-core` do not require updating CHANGELOG files.\r\n- [x] I've updated the relevant crate versions if necessary. [Versioning policy for library crates](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/blob/main/docs/contributing.md#versioning-for-library-crates)\r\n- [ ] I've updated documentation including crate

The Vite <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/team\">team</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/graphs/contributors\">contributors</a>, and ecosystem partners, are excited to announce the release of Vite 5. Vite is now using <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/14508\">Rollup 4</a>, which already represents a big boost in build performance. And there are also new options to improve your dev server performance profile.</p>\n<p>Vite 5 focuses on cleaning up the API (removing deprecated features) and streamlines several features closing long-standing issues, for example switching <code>define</code> to use proper AST replacements instead of regexes. We also continue to take steps to future-proof Vite (Node.js 18+ is now required, and <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration#deprecate-cjs-node-api\">the CJS Node API has been deprecated</a>).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
