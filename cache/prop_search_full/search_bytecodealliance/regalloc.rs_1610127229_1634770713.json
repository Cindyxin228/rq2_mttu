In Substrate we have a logger enabled and by default it uses `info!` to communicate information mostly used for node operators. After the upgrade though there are logging from regalloc. \r\n\r\nI think we can mute the `regalloc` on our side in the logger configuration. However, from what I understand, libraries should strive away from using `info!`. Instead, they should restrict themselves to be under `debug!` and `trace!`. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I figured that I would send a naive PR here to demote all the `info!` to `debug!`.

scan.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is slightly different from the one used for backtracking. Backtracking uses a post-processing approach: during analysis, ranges are marked as reffy (i.e. containing reference types); after register allocation, a spill/reload sequence is generated safepoint instruction contained in a reffy range. Since linear scan has support for splitting live ranges, it is able to integrate reference type processing during register assignment: when an interval (~range) is assigned a real register, if it contains a safepoint instruction, then the interval is split and spilled at the safepoint instruction. A single reffy interval `[ start .. safepoint .. end ]` becomes multiple intervals:\r\n\r\n- `[ start .. (prev mention .. safepoint)[` allocated to the register; the split point may be in any instruction between just after the previous mention, and just before safepoint,\r\n- `[safepoint .. next mention]`, the interval stays stack allocated until the next real mention of the virtual register\r\n- `[next mention .. end]` is an unallocated interval pushed back into the allocation queue\r\n\r\nThis is the general scheme. If the safepoint instruction redefines the register (the register is a use and a def of the call), there's no need to spill and reload it across the instruction.\r\n \r\nThis doesn't handle reffy real ranges, since neither Cranelift or the testing framework effectively put reference types in fixed real registers. The LSRA analysis asserts this right now. In the future, we could consider relaxing the regalloc invariants so that only virtual registers can be reffy, and reffy moves involve both a reffy source vreg and reffy target vreg. If so, we could get rid of the reftypes analysis and all the required bookkeeping data structures LSRA has for this.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/regalloc.rs/issues/110/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bytecodealliance/regalloc.rs/issues/110/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
