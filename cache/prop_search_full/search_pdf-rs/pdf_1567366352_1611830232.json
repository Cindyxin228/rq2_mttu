"body": "This PR adds support for several more PDF encryption variants. Previously, only revision 3 of the standard security handler was supported. This PR adds support for the preceding revision 2 handler, and later formats using AES-128 and AES-256. I added some small test files covering each format, which were generated by encrypting the `example.pdf` test file with different settings.\r\n\r\nAs AES-128 and AES-256 encrypted streams/strings use CBC mode, with PKCS#7 padding, decryption can now fail, whereas previously with RC4 it could only return garbage. The spec states that certain strings in the document are not encrypted, such as the /ID in the trailer, and the contents of the /Encrypt dictionary. As such, the encryption `Decoder` can now take the indirect object reference of the /Encrypt dictionary, and it will skip trying to decrypt any strings within it. (If it tried to decrypt them with a /CFM of /AESV2 or /AESV3, it would throw a padding error when parsing it after the encryption state had been set up. Note also that /ID is read once when the trailer is parsed into a `primitive::Dictionary`, before the encryption state is set up, so no change is needed here.)\r\n\r\nI also did a couple small refactors along the way, to extract common dictionary parsing code, and separated parsing the trailer and setting up decryption out from the following `Trailer::from_primitive()` call, for users such as myself to access the original trailer dictionary.\r\n\r\nWith the new test files, the integration test covers each encryption format, and there is a new unit test to cover plaintext strings in /Encrypt in a minimal RC4 encrypted file.\r\n\r\nNote that owner passwords still aren't supported; I may do a follow-up PR later to add support for that in each revision.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/issues/65/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/issues/65/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/issues/64", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/issues/64/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/issues/64/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/issues/64/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf/pull/64", "id": 715269385, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk4MjA2ODYx", "number": 64, "title": "Handle escaped carriage returns in strings", "user": {"login": "divergentdave", "id": 181772, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTc3Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181772?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave", "html_url": "https://github.com/divergentdave", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/divergentdave/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-10-06T01:27:44Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-07T14:11:56Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-07T07:24:21Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pdf-rs/pdf/pulls/64", "html_url": "https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf/pull/64", "diff_url": "https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf/pull/64.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf/pull/64.patch", "merged_at": "2020-10-07T07:24:21Z"}, "body": "This pull request improves how the literal string lexer handles strings split across multiple lines.

In such cases, the offsets in the trailer and xref tables should be interpreted as offsets from the header, and not offsets from the beginning of the underlying file. See mozilla/pdf.js#6194 for a similar issue in pdf.js. I found a file exhibiting this behavior in the wild at https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=50126&flag=1.\r\n\r\nThere is one TODO outstanding in this PR, so I'll mark it as a draft. Currently, the code searches the beginning of the file for the header's position in multiple places, but I'd like to find a way to compute this once and reuse it. The header offset is needed in both `Backend::read_xref_table_and_trailer(&self)` and `<Storage<B: Backend> as Resolve>::resolve(&self, r: PlainRef)`.\r\n\r\nI think the simplest way to do this would be to compute the header position inside `File<B: Backend>::load_data(backend: B)`, and pass it from there into both `read_xref_table_and_trailer()` and `Storage::new`, storing it inside `Storage` for later use. However, this will require breaking changes to the API, as both `Backend::read_xref_table_and_trailer` and `Storage::new` are both publicly visible.
