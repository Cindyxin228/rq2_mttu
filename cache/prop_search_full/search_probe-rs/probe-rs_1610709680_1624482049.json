However, \"chip erase\" of either erases the entire chip. So probe-rs would do this when flashing:\r\n\r\n- chip erase, write flash contents\r\n- chip erase, write uicr contents\r\n- end result is flash is empty\r\n\r\n### The Fix\r\n\r\nWe assume algo X's chiperase erases all NvmRegions controlled by the algo. This seems to hold for all chips (doesn't for nrf52, but does if we merge the algos since they're actually the same one).\r\n\r\nFirst, group all NvmRegions by flash algo. For each flash algo, do chip erase only once (if requested), then flash all its NvmRegions.\r\n\r\nThis has the nice bonus that all regions of the same algo are flashed together, so the algo is only loaded once.

the erasing.  \r\n\r\nThis flag is helpful for mass production, especially in some cases the chip can be erased with external erasing rigs. To be more specific, CMSIS pack does not provide chip erasing support for some chips like STM32L031K6U6, but the reference manual does indicate that it supports chip erase by toggling RDP bit. So I have made my own chip eraser tool for it. However, probe-rs always re-erase the chip even though the chip is cleared before, as it is impossible to skip the erasing. Therefore here's the PR for adding skip erase support.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJackson", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/probe-rs/probe-rs/issues/628/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":

devices that don't have zadig drivers installed don't show up at all\r\n* [x] Set HID report size to probe's reported packet size\r\n    * This fixes our longstanding #282 problem that prevents EDBG and MCU-Link probes from working\r\n    * Replaces the hardcoded probe sizes proposed in #308 and #590.\r\n    * We initially thought this wouldn't work because it seemed like Windows required you to _always_ use the full report size, but in this PR we use a 64-byte report to initially query the probe for its packet size. However, in my testing so far it seems to work.

This part requires detection of the EDBG device and modify the page size to 512+1 (required by the EDBG) instead of the standard 64+1.
