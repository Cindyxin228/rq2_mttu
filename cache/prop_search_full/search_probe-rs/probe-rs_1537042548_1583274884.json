Which will pull in the repository contents via the git URL provided in the `repositories.yaml`.\r\n\r\nTo not depend on a server, we ship a binary blob with a select set of sanitized configs, which will be placed in the probe.rs config dir at first run.\r\n\r\nTo extract the target descriptions we provide a tool too, which can parse the packs and generate the configs.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should also not leave the algorithms separate as it just makes config management harder.\r\nSo we would just have the target configs.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm for target selection I imagine is:\r\n- Parse all the target configs from the repositories.\r\n- The ones with higher priorities overwrite the ones with lower priorities (I would take the order of the repository urls).\r\n- The user can directly provide a config file via `--config` (or similar) which always wins in priority.\r\n- The parsed targets are inserted into a list/hashmap from which the target then is selected by name.\r\n\r\nI hope this

It's only working with dap-link. This is kinda weird, because when the chip isn't locked I can use st-link to successfully communicate with AP#1 and send an erase (unlock) command with no problem, and it works, I know that because the flash gets indeed erased. However, when the chip is locked the stlink only gets the `0x05` error (`JtagNoDeviceConnected`) when communicating with the CTRL-AP, while the dap-link works without a problem.\r\n\r\nI tried several init configurations for the st-link without success.
