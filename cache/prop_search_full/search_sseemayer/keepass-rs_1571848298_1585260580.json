playing around with WebAssembly lately and the [flate2](https://github.com/alexcrichton/flate2-rs) dependency in its currently used version `0.2` seems to be problematic for wasm-pack to compile this crate. The `flate2` code has been [fixed](https://github.com/alexcrichton/flate2-rs/issues/161) and a `1.0` version of `flate2` exists.\r\n\r\nI went ahead to update it and see if anything breaks. There is one occurrence in the code where they changed the return type of a function and got rid of a `Result<X>`, making a small change necessary.\r\n\r\nI guess the `Cargo.lock` changes come from the dependency updates in `flate2`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sseemayer/keepass-rs/issues/17/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sseemayer/keepass-rs/issues/17/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
