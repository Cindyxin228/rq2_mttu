I figured with a minor version bump this should be okay considering the library is 0.x.x and 1.43.0 is now 2 and a bit years old now.\r\n- Minor fixes.\r\n  - removed unneeded lifetime annotations.\r\n  - removed some duplicated code around error handling with `path_to_cstring`.\r\n  - some use of equivalent but clearer functions (such as `map_or` in instead of `map` followed by `unwrap_or`).\r\n  - removed uneeded unsafe from `get_raw_data`.\r\n  - some documentation changes.\r\n\r\n I can split this into multiple PR's if you would prefer, each commit builds separately so it would be no issue.\r\n\r\nAlso to note is that there is some code that can lead to UB in safe code. `get_data_mut` returns a mutable reference from a shared reference. Clippy caught this and the reasoning for this being unsafe can be found [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#mut_from_ref). The fix for this is to have `get_data_mut` take a mutable reference to self. This however is a breaking API change so I figured it does not fit in the scope of this PR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/alianse777/darknet-rust/issues/16/reactions",
