I decided to [implement the missing pieces](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/pull/1384), and recently the new version of the `openssl` crate has been published, making these new APIs available for josekit.\r\n\r\nI based my work on `openssl` on your work on `josekit`, so I did nothing more than creating an abstraction layer over your code. With this PR, `josekit` is 100% safe code, which is always a nice feature to have.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you like this.\r\nThank you for efforts you put into this crate! :heart: ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hidekatsu-izuno/josekit-rs/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hidekatsu-izuno/josekit-rs/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
