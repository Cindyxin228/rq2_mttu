All of them return none as the CPUs from AMD do not support the features that are used to get the information for Intel CPUs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's also Vice versa, so I couldn't just use the mechanism for AMD to get the data for Intel as some of the instructions that work for AMD do not work for intel. This is why there is a if statement to check if the target architecture is AMD, and to otherwise run the code as it functioned before. Let me know if there is anything you need me to update to fit what you think this project should look like.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the great work \ud83d\ude04 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lovesegfault/cache-size/issues/10/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lovesegfault/cache-size/issues/10/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
