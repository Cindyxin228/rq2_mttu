like to propose a small addition.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that dropping a listener after starting to listen to changes causes its internal loop to be stuck in a tight loop:\r\n```\r\n2024-03-18T07:42:11.255745Z DEBUG firestore::db::listen_changes: Exiting from listener on targets... num_targets=2\r\n2024-03-18T07:42:11.255754Z DEBUG firestore::db::listen_changes: Start listening on targets... num_targets=2\r\n2024-03-18T07:42:11.256078Z DEBUG firestore::db::listen_changes: Exiting from listener on targets... num_targets=2\r\n2024-03-18T07:42:11.256087Z DEBUG

num_targets=2\r\n2024-03-18T07:42:11.256447Z DEBUG firestore::db::listen_changes: Start listening on targets... num_targets=2\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe situation can be reproduced by dropping the listener in the `listen-changes` example instead of retaining it for `shutdown` like this:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/examples/listen-changes.rs b/examples/listen-changes.rs\r\nindex a1adc1b..eac0776 100644\r\n--- a/examples/listen-changes.rs\r\n+++ b/examples/listen-changes.rs\r\n@@ -94,6 +94,9 @@ async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {\r\n             Ok(())\r\n

I'm assuming that dropping the listener without calling `shutdown` is an error (so maybe the log I'm adding should be a warn/error?) but I believe it's still better to stop the loop instead of spinning.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/abdolence/firestore-rs/issues/158/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,

We're also able to easily pull out data from these fields, which is helpful not only for Log Analytics, but for log-based metrics!\r\n\r\nWe actually run our services with debug-level logging enabled for the firestore crate in order to get better insight into the behavior and performance of the database, and track down cases of transaction contention, which is why I've made this PR.\r\n\r\nThe root-level documentation of tracing has additional explanation of the merits of using fields [here](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#recording-fields).\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of what this looks like in Log Analytics for one of our services. This maybe isn't the best example because I've picked a small sample so I didn't have to draw so many black boxes, but you can see where some firestore events haven't been grouped.\r\n\r\n![log_analytics_example](https://github.com/abdolence/firestore-rs/assets/2770254/34a8401f-c9e9-4a8c-b675-5e61b0dfef01)\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued, high quality work on this

Intent\r\nThis feature aims to add functionality for optional `FirestoreTimestamp` fields.  \r\n\r\nUsing `#[serde(with = \"firestore::serialize_as_timestamp\")]` on an `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` field resulted in build errors within the `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derive macro. Due to this, resorting to using `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` without the relevant serializer resulted in firestore saving the Timestamp-like value as a string. \r\n\r\nTo avoid further complicating data consistency issues, it seemed as though creating an additional serializer for optional timestamps was appropriate.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n- Added functionality and relevant serializer for `Option<FirestoreTimestamp>`.\r\n- Separated `serialize_as_timestamp` from newly created `serialize_as_optional_timestamp` to preserve original functionality.\r\n- Updated `serialize_none` to utilize `ValueType::NullValue`.\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n- Is there potentially a way to combine both serializers into one to be able to handle `Option<T>` and `T`?", "reactions": {"url":

aims to implement a feature found in Firestore implementations for other languages, such as [Go](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/feb6b0a8b771875a55c75fa959e19f6f12079030/firestore/transaction.go#LL93C41-L93C41) and [Typescript](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-firestore/blob/d6d44e1e58b379f33f893fa6b151abfe1352b9b3/dev/src/transaction.ts#LL470C9-L470C23).\r\n\r\nThese \"run transaction\" functions allow the user to pass in a closure that performs reads and/or writes and attempts to commit a transaction with a limited number of retries. Many of the details are not exposed to the user.\r\n\r\nI've introduced an example that uses `run_transaction` to increment a counter concurrently using `FuturesOrdered`.\r\n\r\n# Potential Problems\r\n- ~I've introduced the [backoff](https://crates.io/crates/backoff) crate into the Cargo.toml. If this is not desirable, we can rework the retry mechanism such that it does not bring in a dependency.~\r\n- Users' closures must be wrapped in `Box::pin` presently. Is it possible to push this into the `run_transaction` function itself?\r\n- ~I've placed the implementation directly into `FirestoreDb`. This seems okay, but is it the correct place for it?~\r\n- `run_transaction` will always use `ReadWrite` for the consistency selector. Shouldn't we handle `ReadOnly` transactions as well?\r\n- We should expose some options about the transaction behavior to the user, as the SDKs in other languages do. This includes retry configuration, a manual specification of the transaction read time, and whether or not the transaction should be read-only (which perhaps solves the previous potential issue)\r\n- ~All reads must take place before any writes in the transaction, but I haven't tested to verify that we gracefully handle that error.~", "reactions": {"url":
