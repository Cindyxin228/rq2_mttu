So if users\r\n  want to connect to this network, they need only use this switch rather than manually supplying\r\n  `--network-id`, `--network-contacts-url` and/or `--peer` arguments.\r\n\r\n- bbe131cf3 **feat: select evm network based on network id**\r\n\r\n  The doc comments on the `get_evm_network` function provide more detail, but the summary is:\r\n  * The `EVM_NETWORK` and associated variables are checked first. They allow the selection of a preset\r\n    or a custom configuration.\r\n  * Otherwise if these variables are not being used:\r\n      + If no network ID is being used and it's not a local network, we use network ID `1` and so we\r\n        select Arbitrum One.\r\n      + If the `--alpha` argument has been used we use network ID `2` and so we select Arbitrum\r\n        Sepolia Test.\r\n      + If a network ID has been explicitly supplied we are in a testnet scenario and therefore we\r\n        will assert that the `EVM_NETWORK` variables must be used.\r\n\r\n  If these conditions are not met the binary will error. I think this is better than selecting a\r\n  default network because when I've been testing with users I've seen this result in confusion about\r\n  exactly which EVM network was being selected.\r\n\r\n- 377c64399 **chore: formatting and test fix up**\r\n\r\n  I still don't have Cursor setup like Neovim where it formatted on save.\r\n\r\n  This commit also fixes up a few bootstrapping tests after the code was changed. The code will return\r\n  the production network contacts unless it returns early, and that is done by putting a limit on the\r\n  number of contacts.\r\n\r\n- b63a05dd4 **chore: explicitly set version strings when setting network id**\r\n\r\n  It is possible that some of these strings would be read before the network ID is set and they would\r\n  then have their value assigned for the lifetime of the program, even after `set_network_id` is\r\n  called.\r\n\r\n  They all need to be explicitly updated when `set_network_id` is called.", "reactions": {"url":

the quoting and uploading process a lot.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the client doesn't set up the query_timeout.\r\nThe default value that got used is 60s, which is way too long.\r\n\r\nHence, to improve the quoting performance, this PR contains following work:\r\n1.  using `re-dial` only during the re-attempt, to avoid un-necessary time out.\r\n2.  set client query_timeout to be 10s\r\n\r\nWith the above, the quoting time against production network reduced to 30s (from the previous 3 min 20s).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n### Footer (Hidden from GitHub view)\r\nThis template uses [conventional

In the QUIC protocol, an attacker can\ninduce this panic by sending a specially-crafted packet. Even unintentionally\nit is likely to occur in 1 out of every 2**32 packets sent and/or received.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic on 64-bit targets in <code>ring::aead::{AES_128_GCM, AES_256_GCM}</code>\nwhen overflow checking is enabled, when encrypting/decrypting approximately\n68,719,476,700 bytes (about 64 gigabytes) of data in a single chunk.

But we cannot just add all the peers to the RT, i.e, say a client querying for store costs for hundreds of chunks. \r\n- There is a `PeerAddresses` which is a LRU cache as part of the `identify` Behaviour, where we could add these addresses to, but that directly ties in the # of requests a client could do with the size of the cache. Hence the cache approach is dropped.\r\n- Thus, this PR modifies the `ant_networking` fn calls to accommodate for an `Addresses(Vec<MulitAddr>)` struct wherever it is necessary. \r\n- Replication

For this we implemented a locking mechanism (semaphore) per node (`locked` on `NodeItem`). It's set to `true` before starting a `NodeManagementTask` and `false` when succeeds or returns with error. There are some helper functions for that effect.\r\n \r\n#### Validation\r\n* Validations when adding nodes (`[+]`) regarding the maximum amount of nodes and available disk space. Some helpers were created for the error messages.\r\n* Validation of some edge cases like operations without nodes, when the application starts from scratch.\r\n* New popup screen when trying to remove (`[-]`) a node. Gives a warning.\r\n\r\n### Styling\r\n* Changed footer style and behavior depending on the application state. Now is sort of flexible when shrinking the terminal (minimal resolution 80x24).\r\n\r\n### Extras\r\n* Some minor error message formatting.\r\n* Changed the legend when upgrading nodes as is difficult to pass the amount of nodes between scenes. Instead of calculating total time of upgrade, we just mention how much takes per node.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug fix \ud83d\udc1e \r\n* We added `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_START` as a constant.
