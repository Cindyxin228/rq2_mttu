examination, though the total size of involved code is relatively large.\r\n\r\nHowever, the change is small enough to be within a range that is difficult to benchmark, and it's not yet clear how other changes (e.g. switching to a `crypto-bigint` backend) will impact performance.\r\n\r\nSo this commit accepts this performance regression for now with a note to follow up on potentially switching
