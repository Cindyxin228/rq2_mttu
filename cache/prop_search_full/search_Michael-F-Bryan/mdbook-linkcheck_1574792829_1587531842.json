compare the `exclude` array properly, for example, if one was a prefix of the another, they would be considered equal (hint: `Iterator::zip` is short-cutting \ud83d\ude04 ). This is fixed.\r\n\r\n## What is not implemented\r\nEnvironment variables interpolation. I agree this is pretty easy to implement, but I'd like to clarify the syntax. `$` + ident? maybe also `\\$` escape...\r\n\r\n## Further improvements \r\nIn my opinion, it would be better to use some wrapper in place of `Regex`, implementing string-based `Hash`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `PartialEq` for it. It would greatly simplify certain parts of the code, but that would be a breaking change since you'd already put a `Regex` in the public API (the `exclude` array).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\nTests (how should they look like?) and documentation.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Michael-F-Bryan/mdbook-linkcheck/issues/24/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Michael-F-Bryan/mdbook-linkcheck/issues/24/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
