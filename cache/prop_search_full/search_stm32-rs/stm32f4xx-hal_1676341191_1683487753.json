description\r\nThis PR closes #590 \r\n\r\n* Adds two methods to the blocking I2c implementation: `use_dma_tx`, `use_dma_rx` to create I2CMasterDma that use only one of Tx/Rx channels.\r\n* Clients can only use `write_dma` and all blocking methods if using Tx only I2c DMA. \r\n* Clients can only use `read_dma` and all blocking methods if using Rx only I2c DMA. \r\n\r\n# What has changed for clients\r\n* An `I2CMasterDma` signature now has 3 generic parameters:\r\n  1.  I2C instance\r\n  2. `TxDMA` with same I2C instance, DMA stream and channel number or `NoDMA` if Tx is not used\r\n  3.  `RxDMA` with same I2C instance, DMA stream and channel number or `NoDMA` if Rx is not used\r\n* The client must import `I2CMasterHandleIT` from `stm32f4xx_hal::i2c::dma` for access interrupt handling methods or just use `stm32f4xx_hal::prelude::*`\r\n* The client must also import `TxDMA`, `RxDMA`, `NoDMA` from same module", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal/issues/598/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

MHz causes clock glitches, which result in CRC errors (at least in embassy-stm32). In this HAL, the CRC error is not caught and write silently fails without changing any bytes on SD card.\r\n\r\nSection from `STM32F42xx and STM32F43xx Errata sheet`:\r\n```\r\n2.13.1 SDIO HW flow control\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nWhen enabling the HW flow control by setting bit 14 of the SDIO_CLKCR register to \u20181\u2019,\r\nglitches can occur on the SDIOCLK output clock resulting in wrong data to be written into\r\nthe SD/MMC card or into the SDIO device. As a consequence, a CRC error will be reported\r\nto the SD/SDIO MMC host interface (DCRCFAIL bit set to \u20181\u2019 in SDIO_STA register).\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNote: Do not use the HW flow control. Overrun errors (Rx mode) and FIFO underrun (Tx mode)\r\nshould be managed by the application software.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFAIK, this affects all SDIOv1 peripherals including the F1 family, and possibly others.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the CRC error not getting caught, but this PR at least fixes the chip errata.", "reactions": {"url":
