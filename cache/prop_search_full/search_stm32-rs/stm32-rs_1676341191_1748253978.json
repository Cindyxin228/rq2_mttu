F7 devices.\r\n\r\n## Patch structure\r\n\r\nMost of the fields are implemented the same way across the target devices, but there are still differences between models. Taking the whole range of devices, there are at least 7 OPTCR variants, 2 OPTCR1 variants and 1 OPTCR2 variant.\r\n\r\nTo share as much code as possible while enabling a lean composition in the device yaml, the added patch files are organised like this:\r\n\r\n- common fields are described in `devices/fields/flash/flash_optcr.yaml`\r\n- specific fields are described in their specific yaml file `devices/fields/flash/flash_optcr_*field*.yaml`\r\n\r\nRegister `OPTCR1` doesn't really have a default variant so it is just split between `devices/fields/flash/flash_optcr1_boot.yaml` or `devices/fields/flash/flash_optcr1_nwrp.yaml`.\r\n\r\nRegister `OPTCR2` only has 1 variant, written in `devices/fields/flash/flash_optcr2.yaml`.\r\n\r\n## Bit fields management\r\n\r\nThere are 2 peculiar fields in these registers, `nWRP` and `PCROP`, which are not enums but bit fields (or flags).\r\n\r\nTo enable a dedicated read/write access to each bit of the fields, there are split in N fields using the _split_ command in `devices/patches/flash/optcr_*.yaml`, then collected as an array in `devices/collect/flash/optcr*_*.yaml`.\r\n\r\n### nWRP\r\n\r\nThis technic is especially usefull for the `nWRP` field, as it doesn't have the same size across F2, F4 and F7 devices (it can be 5, 8, 12, 15 bits long). Using the `*` wildcard character ensures the _split_ and _collect_ methods covers all these sizes.\r\n\r\nUsing `?` doesn't work in this case, as it only counts for a single character, thus limiting the array index to 9.\r\n\r\n### PCROP\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the `PCROP` register uses `?` as its index is limited to 8, and the pattern `PCROP*` would conflict with another field named `PCROP_MOD` in the same register.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nDuring testing I noticed some issues with SVDs for 401, 411, 412, 413 and 730 devices. A patch has been created here while the issue is handled upstream by ST developpers.\r\n\r\nI also noticed inconsistencies in the `nWRP` bit size between SVD and reference manuals, I didn't create a patch as I didn't feel it was a major issue, but I'll report this upstream anyway.\r\n\r\nCloses #1154.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/issues/1157/reactions",
