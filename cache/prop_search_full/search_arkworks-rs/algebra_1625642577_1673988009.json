The motivation os further outlined in issue #537 : \r\n\r\nThis PR moves the implementation of the functions `multi_miller_loop` and `final_exponentiation` in the `BW6` model from the `Pairing` trait into the `BW6Parameters` trait. Here they serve as default implementations, which are then referenced in the Pairing implementation for `BW6`.\r\n\r\nThis way we can overwrite the default implementations for both functions when we define model curves for the BW6 model. The motivation for this is like the one in https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra/pull/528 : we can provide our own implementations on platforms on which elliptic curve arithmetic is slow or for the case os specialized hardware.\r\n\r\ncloses: #XXXX\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this PR, please make sure that all the following items have been\r\nchecked off.

It is slow in WebAssembly runtimes and can usually get speed up by special hardware. This makes it interesting to define a custom `msm` function in the model which overwrites the default implementation. This custom function could compute the msm by calling into host functions from a WebAssembly runtime or by delegating it to customized hardware.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- reimplements `msm` from the `VariableBaseMSM` trait in the `SWCurveConfig` trait, refers there to `msm_unchecked` from the `VariableBaseMSM` trait. This function ois called `model_msm`\r\n- refers to `model_msm` implementation provided by the `SWCurveConfig` trait in the `VariableBaseMSM` implementation for `Projective<P>`\r\n- now the `model_msm` bigint function can get overwritten by curves which are implementing the `SWCurveConfig` trait.\r\n\r\nSimilar motivation and technique then the already merged PR #534 .

This causes unexpected / incorrect behavior when larger polynomials are used. This PR resolves the issue by reducing the polynomial mod `X^d` where `d` is the size of the domain, before the FFT is performed.\r\n\r\nA new unit test is located in `src/polynomial/univariate/sparse.rs`\r\n\r\nIt may also be a good idea to throw an error in the FFT routine when the coefficient vector is bigger than the FFT size, so that information is not accidentally discarded.\r\n\r\ncloses: #520\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this PR, please make sure that all the following items have been\r\nchecked off.
