Unit tests are written against the RustCrypto sha256 implementation.\r\n\r\nBesides the standard `update()` and `finalize()` operations, this also implements the CRH traits both natively and in circuit-land.\r\n\r\nTwo things that I have questions about:\r\n* The `CRHScheme::Output` for `Sha256` is `Vec<u8>` rather than `[u8; 32]`. The reason for this is because the compiler complains about not implementing `CanonicalSerialize` and `CanonicalDeserialize` otherwise. I think this is fixed in the next version of `ark-serialize`, so we might just want to leave this and update it when v0.4 comes around.\r\n* SHA256 is not parameterized by anything, so I set the `CRHScheme::ParametersVar` to `()`. However, it's unclear what the appropriate thing to set `CRHSchemeGadget::ParametersVar` to is. I should be the Var equivalent to the unit type. To that end, I made my own `UnitVar` type that impls `AllocaVar`. If this duplicates something from elsewhere, let me know and I'll just use that functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this PR, please make sure that all the following items have been\r\nchecked off.
