Unit tests are written against the RustCrypto sha256 implementation.\r\n\r\nBesides the standard `update()` and `finalize()` operations, this also implements the CRH traits both natively and in circuit-land.\r\n\r\nTwo things that I have questions about:\r\n* The `CRHScheme::Output` for `Sha256` is `Vec<u8>` rather than `[u8; 32]`. The reason for this is because the compiler complains about not implementing `CanonicalSerialize` and `CanonicalDeserialize` otherwise. I think this is fixed in the next version of `ark-serialize`, so we might just want to leave this and update it when v0.4 comes around.\r\n* SHA256 is not parameterized by anything, so I set the `CRHScheme::ParametersVar` to `()`. However, it's unclear what the appropriate thing to set `CRHSchemeGadget::ParametersVar` to is. I should be the Var equivalent to the unit type. To that end, I made my own `UnitVar` type that impls `AllocaVar`. If this duplicates something from elsewhere, let me know and I'll just use that functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this PR, please make sure that all the following items have been\r\nchecked off.

description of the changes that this PR introduces and the files that\r\nare the most critical to review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# \ud83c\udf32 Merkle Tree V3 & Poseidon Refactor\r\nPart of the PR follows the proposal #58, which adds more functionality to merkle tree. \r\n- Merkle tree no longer requires hashes to input and output bytes. \r\n- User can specify how to transition from leaf hash layer to inner hash layer\r\n- `TwoToOneCRH` trait requires a `compress` function, which takes two `Output` and outputs an `Output`. \r\n- Add tracing for merkle tree constraints for easier debug\r\n- Refactor Poseidon to match [`ark_sponge`](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/sponge)\r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor CRH API and CRHGadget API so that CRH does not necessarily takes bytes as input\r\n- [x] Refactor all implementations of CRH to follow the updated API\r\n- [x] Refactor merkle tree native code. \r\n- [x] Refactor merkle tree constraints code. \r\n\r\ncloses: #57\r\ncloses: #58\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this PR, please make sure that all the following items have been\r\nchecked off.
