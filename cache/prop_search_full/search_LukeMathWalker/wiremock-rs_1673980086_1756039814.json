change is related to building the error messages when mock verification fails. Since it panics with the constructed strings directly, there currently isn't a way to unit-test their content without significant changes, but I did verify manually that the content doesn't change. I also verified that the documentation links being changed still work, though one of them changes from `std::drop::Drop` to `core::drop::Drop`.\r\n\r\nAs for the code coverage step, the entire [actions-rs](https://github.com/actions-rs) organization has been archived as of October of this year.

I thought let's keep it simple, so it just prints the address:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMockServer { address: 127.0.0.1:54181 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Motivation:** [cucumber-rs](https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber) requires all implementations of `cucumber::World` to implement `Debug`. Given all members implement `Debug`, it can be derived:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Default, Debug, cucumber::World)]\r\nWorld { // keeps all state of a test scenario, therefore mock_server fits well\r\n  ...\r\n  pub mock_server: Option<wiremock::MockServer>, // <- compilation error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course it is possible to implement `Debug` for `World`, but less ergonomic.

services take in multipart data or binary data in the HTTP body and when a wiremock predicate fails megabytes of binary data get printed out to the console. Here I address this by not printing out a string if it isn't valid utf8 and instead printing out the body length.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative may be to put in an upper limit to how large a body will be printed and if it exceeds that size maybe saving the request to a file for later analysis. But this change was so simple I figured I'd open the PR first to start the discussion.\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/124\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/125/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/125/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/122", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/122/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/122/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/issues/122/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/pull/122", "id": 1804446911, "node_id": "PR_kwDODzOl0s5VfzKE", "number": 122, "title": "Update README with state of mockito", "user": {"login": "lipanski", "id": 1537039, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzcwMzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537039?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski", "html_url": "https://github.com/lipanski", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lipanski/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-07-14T08:24:56Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-14T11:34:56Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-14T11:34:55Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/pulls/122", "html_url": "https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/pull/122", "diff_url": "https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/pull/122.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs/pull/122.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-14T11:34:55Z"}, "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nMockito has been supporting parallel tests, multiple servers and async since [version 0.32](https://github.com/lipanski/mockito/releases).

(code is not how I want it to be yet, and the tests don't yet pass. this is purely to demonstrate the extra complexity this adds).\r\n\r\nThe original `is_satisfied` API was designed around the idea we could poll in a backoff loop for a mock to have received its expected calls. The compelling use case here is triggering an async action through a message queue, and expecting a HTTP request eventually.\r\n\r\nInstead of using polls with a retry loop, we could instead utilise the tools Rust gives us with async futures. These are already poll loops, but with reactive management rather than passive timers. This seems more correct to me.\r\n\r\nI would also have liked to make `satisfied` take a timeout duration by default, but given this library is async runtime agnostic, I'd rather not break that
