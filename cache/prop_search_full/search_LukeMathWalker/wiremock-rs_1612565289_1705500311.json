I thought let's keep it simple, so it just prints the address:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMockServer { address: 127.0.0.1:54181 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Motivation:** [cucumber-rs](https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber) requires all implementations of `cucumber::World` to implement `Debug`. Given all members implement `Debug`, it can be derived:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Default, Debug, cucumber::World)]\r\nWorld { // keeps all state of a test scenario, therefore mock_server fits well\r\n  ...\r\n  pub mock_server: Option<wiremock::MockServer>, // <- compilation error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course it is possible to implement `Debug` for `World`, but less ergonomic.

(code is not how I want it to be yet, and the tests don't yet pass. this is purely to demonstrate the extra complexity this adds).\r\n\r\nThe original `is_satisfied` API was designed around the idea we could poll in a backoff loop for a mock to have received its expected calls. The compelling use case here is triggering an async action through a message queue, and expecting a HTTP request eventually.\r\n\r\nInstead of using polls with a retry loop, we could instead utilise the tools Rust gives us with async futures. These are already poll loops, but with reactive management rather than passive timers. This seems more correct to me.\r\n\r\nI would also have liked to make `satisfied` take a timeout duration by default, but given this library is async runtime agnostic, I'd rather not break that
