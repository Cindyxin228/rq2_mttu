If it succeeds, extract the token from the proxy response and set it in the cache, before setting it on the request and proceeding.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more elegant to have the cache be a layer on the proxy client, but I had some difficulty implementing this. It's certainly something we should consider in the future.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass except for one assertion in the `api_create_get_delete_projects` test, which is commented out.

for live deployment but it will probably break any and all deployments currently using `Secrets.toml`, as well as there being an example project in testing that currently uses `Secrets.toml`, so until there's further consideration about how to deal with live deployments that currently use secrets it's probably a good idea to leave this unchanged until a discussion on how to solve this has been
