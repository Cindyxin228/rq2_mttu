In this PR, I have started to address some of this. For now, I have:\r\n\r\n* added documentation to pretty much everything that the lints warn about.\r\n* made clippy a lot more annoying.\r\n* addressed all clippy lints.\r\n\r\nThere are also some changes to function signatures as suggested by clippy. These include:\r\n\r\n* Removing the `Box<dyn Fn<...>>` types with the simpler `fn(...)` types.\r\n* Marking several `const fn` functions because they get evaluated at compile time, thus improving runtime performance.\r\n\r\nI have ignored two clippy lints for the crate:\r\n\r\n* Module name repeated in struct name: I think this is too pedantic a lint and would be a massive API change that I don't think you would want for now. Perhaps later.\r\n* Functions with too many lines: I'm going to address this in a separate PR after spending some more time on the code.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cmccomb/rust-automl/issues/3/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cmccomb/rust-automl/issues/3/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
