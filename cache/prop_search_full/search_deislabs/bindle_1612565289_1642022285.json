My theory, which I cannot entire prove, is that because the CLI stops execution, the file write did not complete, particularly on slower systems like the GH Action runners. So now we make sure to manually flush the file in places where we are not using the `write` style helper functions. I fixed this anywhere in the CLI it was not flushing. I also noticed that the logic as specified in the `create-key` command would not work with the current `save_file` method as it was using `create_new` to save the file. This changes it to `create` so that it can overwrite the existing file", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/206/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/206/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205", "id": 957120169, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzAwNjEzOTM5", "number": 205, "title": "exp(provider): Adds support for experimental embedded provider", "user": {"login": "thomastaylor312", "id": 4294228, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTQyMjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4294228?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312", "html_url": "https://github.com/thomastaylor312", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-07-30T23:33:56Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-05T16:14:30Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-05T16:14:27Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/pulls/205", "html_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205", "diff_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-05T16:14:27Z"}, "body": "This PR adds support for a new embedded `Provider` backed by the `sled`\r\nembedded database and with more efficient data encoding. This new\r\nprovider is behind a feature flag and is not compiled into `bindle-server`\r\nby default. Tests have also been updated to check both providers, but\r\nthe client tests still only test with the `FileProvider`.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this is that the file system provider requires a bunch of\r\nbespoke logic to check things like locking and various OS specific things. We\r\nalso have to front everything with an in-memory LRU cache. Tools like `sled`\r\nalready have most of these features built in, plus additional guarantees from\r\nbeing a database (such as atomic transations and upsert commands). This also\r\nuses a binary encoding format to store the data using less bytes and to\r\ndecrease serialization and deserialization time. All of these reasons\r\nsounded like pretty good justification for giving it a whirl. Use of bindle\r\ncan continue as before until we decide whether we like this or not as it\r\nis all behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\nAny comments on open TODOs are welcome!", "reactions": {"url":

This is usually safe because the Bindle server speaks HTTP/2.  However, on certain occasions, certain rare and vexatious occasions, when the Bindle server is hidden behind a proxy or tunnel, a low, brutish proxy or tunnel that clings to savage, degraded protocols such as HTTP/1.1.  The Bindle server is perfectly happy being talked via such a proxy or tunnel, but the _client_ cannot establish communication because the oafish, ignorant proxy fails to comprehend its initial HTTP/2 greeting.\r\n\r\nFor these cases, these sad cases, it is useful to be able to have the client approach the proxy using HTTP/1.1 (and request an upgrade to HTTP/2).  In my sample of 1 tunnelling service, this worked 100% of the time.  This PR adds an option to do exactly that.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I have not surfaced this option on the Bindle CLI; it is only on the Bindle client crate.  However, we could make it available e.g. via an environment variable, or even default the CLI to this behaviour as the performance benefit of bypassing negotiation may not be significant in an
