default behavior of this crate the same if desired. \r\n\r\nMy main reason for doing this is so that I can depend on `bindle` without bringing in the openssl requirement which can be difficult to

I don't yet understand why those files would compile in the Bindle client and server, but they don't compile in WAGI.  And adding the trait to the files makes them give an \"unused import\" warning in Bindle!\r\n\r\nThe fix is to instead use Signature's `TryFrom` implementation, which is documented in the Signature examples, doesn't need to be brought into scope, and delegates directly to `from_bytes` so shouldn't change any behaviour #famouslastwords.\r\n\r\n@vdice would be great if you could give this a test please - I'm not sure how to exercise the signature stuff.
