My theory, which I cannot entire prove, is that because the CLI stops execution, the file write did not complete, particularly on slower systems like the GH Action runners. So now we make sure to manually flush the file in places where we are not using the `write` style helper functions. I fixed this anywhere in the CLI it was not flushing. I also noticed that the logic as specified in the `create-key` command would not work with the current `save_file` method as it was using `create_new` to save the file. This changes it to `create` so that it can overwrite the existing file", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/206/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/206/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/issues/205/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205", "id": 957120169, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzAwNjEzOTM5", "number": 205, "title": "exp(provider): Adds support for experimental embedded provider", "user": {"login": "thomastaylor312", "id": 4294228, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTQyMjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4294228?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312", "html_url": "https://github.com/thomastaylor312", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomastaylor312/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-07-30T23:33:56Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-05T16:14:30Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-05T16:14:27Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/deislabs/bindle/pulls/205", "html_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205", "diff_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/pull/205.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-05T16:14:27Z"}, "body": "This PR adds support for a new embedded `Provider` backed by the `sled`\r\nembedded database and with more efficient data encoding. This new\r\nprovider is behind a feature flag and is not compiled into `bindle-server`\r\nby default. Tests have also been updated to check both providers, but\r\nthe client tests still only test with the `FileProvider`.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this is that the file system provider requires a bunch of\r\nbespoke logic to check things like locking and various OS specific things. We\r\nalso have to front everything with an in-memory LRU cache. Tools like `sled`\r\nalready have most of these features built in, plus additional guarantees from\r\nbeing a database (such as atomic transations and upsert commands). This also\r\nuses a binary encoding format to store the data using less bytes and to\r\ndecrease serialization and deserialization time. All of these reasons\r\nsounded like pretty good justification for giving it a whirl. Use of bindle\r\ncan continue as before until we decide whether we like this or not as it\r\nis all behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\nAny comments on open TODOs are welcome!", "reactions": {"url":
