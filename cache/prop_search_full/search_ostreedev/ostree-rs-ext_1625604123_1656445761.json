https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/pull/328\r\n\r\n---\r\ncontainer: Introduce an `ExportLayout::ChunkedV1`\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/309\r\n\r\nI discovered that (what are now called) \"chunkedv0\" images were missing some\r\ndirectories like `/tmp`.  This is because the way chunking was implemented\r\nwas...basically broken.\r\n\r\nIn chunking v0 we have:\r\n\r\n- content objects\r\n- content objects\r\n- ...\r\n- ostree layer (commit, ostree metadata)\r\n- Any derived layers\r\n\r\nBut...we really want to \"mirror\" in the tar stream in a proper\r\nfashion everything that's in the ostree layer. Particularly, in order\r\nto ensure e.g. correct permissions/ownership, the directory entries\r\nmust come first.\r\n\r\nAnd logically, it makes sense to have the layer bearing the ostree\r\ncommit and the ostree metadata come first.\r\n\r\nSo the new \"ChunkedV1\" format is:\r\n\r\n- ostree layer (commit, ostree metadata, all directories_\r\n- content objects\r\n- content objects\r\n- ...\r\n- Any derived layers\r\n\r\nThe ChunkedV1 format can be identified by a new image label:\r\n`const OSTREE_FINAL_LAYER_LABEL: &str = \"ostree.final-diffid\";`\r\nthis label points to the last content object layer.\r\n\r\nImplementation wise, this is mostly adding conditionals in\r\nvarious places.\r\n\r\nI'm perhaps being very conservative here in *also* continuing to\r\nsupport 'chunkedv0 images.  Right now they're not deployed\r\nwidely (AFAIK), just shipping Fedora Rawhide this way.\r\n\r\nBut on the plus side, we'll be able to kill off all the old format\r\ncode when this stuff is all stable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncontainer: Condense `ExportLayout` to just V0 and V1\r\n\r\nI had a galaxy brain moment earlier today when looking at this PR;\r\na lot of the matching was doing `SingleLayer | ChunkedV1`.  Everything\r\njust gets simpler if we consider the \"single layer\" a special case\r\nof a \"chunked\" image with a single chunk - which we already support!\r\n\r\nIn the export code, if no content mapping is provided we create\r\na default chunking.  (This can and should be optimized later to\r\navoid traversing all objects up front; we can special case this)\r\n\r\nAnother way to look at this is that the change in the export side\r\nfrom the tar stream perspective is that we now have:\r\n\r\n- all directories and ostree metadata\r\n- all content objects in hash ordering\r\n\r\nAnd here's a key bit: The old (<= ostree-ext 0.7) tar parser\r\nwill still parse this just fine - it doesn't currently care about\r\nobject ordering.  And the same is true for container runtimes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncontainer: Make `export_layout` bit in prepared import `pub`\r\n\r\nRight now we're not using it, but I think we should support\r\ncallers e.g. logging it at least.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/331/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

images are format v1 tar; let's add some unit-test style\r\ncode that validates the tar structure there in the same way we\r\nverify direct tar exports.\r\n\r\nPrep for fixing https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/309\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nchunking: Include all directories in ostree layer\r\n\r\nThis is prep for fixing https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/309\r\nbut it will not fix it on its own; to do that we need to introduce\r\na new chunked format.  That is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn the default tar export, we walk a commit from the \"root\".  When\r\nexporting chunked images (what will soon be called \"chunkedv0\")\r\nwe instead export content objects, then a final layer which\r\ncontains the ostree metadata (commit and dirtree/dirmeta).\r\n\r\nBut in that \"chunkedv0\" flow, nothing creates the *tar* equivalent\r\nof directories.  This has a number of problems; primarily it will\r\nimplicitly omit any directories which do not have content in them\r\n(for example `/tmp`).  We also won't have the proper ownership/directories\r\nreflected in the tar stream.\r\n\r\nIn this commit, change how we generate the \"ostree layer\" which\r\ncontains the ostree metadata to walk from the ostree-commit\r\nas a root; except we just don't emit any content objects in that\r\nflow to start, assuming they were emitted earlier.\r\n\r\n(It is common for chunkedv0 images to have content objects, they\r\n are just emitted as a second phase)\r\n\r\nNote that we no longer need to gather all metadata objects when\r\nprocessing chunking, because we'll end up walking everything in\r\nthe export phase instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/328/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/328/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/327", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/327/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/327/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/327/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/pull/327", "id": 1286008837, "node_id": "PR_kwDOFR5pIs46bUol", "number": 327, "title": "tests: Expose `ocidir`, but only when testing", "user": {"login": "cgwalters", "id": 244096, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDA5Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/244096?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters", "html_url": "https://github.com/cgwalters", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-06-27T15:56:03Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-27T17:31:53Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-27T17:31:53Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/pulls/327", "html_url": "https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/pull/327", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/pull/327.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/pull/327.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-27T17:31:53Z"}, "body": "I want to do some more unit-test-style validation of our exported\r\ncontainer images.

case and I'm sure others, we want a flow where\r\nwe do a build (including a container image) and then once it's ready,\r\nwe sign it by passing the commit metadata to a separate

flow\r\nreuse the tar path of having the signature be part of the tar stream\r\ninstead of part of the container metadata, because it *greatly*\r\ncomplicates things here, particularly in terms of handling chunked\r\nimages.\r\n\r\nWe want to preserve all metadata and other layers in the image;\r\nwe just need to add/replace a single entry in the layer that has\r\nthe ostree

write support\r\nvia skopeo/containers-image-proxy.  Because we don't, given\r\nan image on a remote registry, right now we pull the whole thing\r\ndown into a temporary OCI directory, even though we only want to\r\nmutate one layer.\r\n\r\nCloses:

I've been working on this ostree stuff for\r\nlike 10 years now it turns out that I still stuck at writing\r\nthe test suites.\r\n\r\nWhen I generated the hardcoded `exampleos-v0.tar.zstd`, I apparently\r\nincluded SELinux labels (I don't think intentionally).\r\nBut I didn't when generating `exampleos-v1.tar`!\r\n\r\nI was trying to test an upgrade path around xattrs and hit a bug there\r\ncode, and it took me a while to understand it was because the second\r\nupdate didn't have them!\r\n\r\nThe time it took to debug this was greatly extended by me reading\r\n`man tar`, and thinking that `tar -tf -v --xattrs` would print any SELinux\r\nlabel.  But no - SELinux is *special cased* in tar - even though\r\nit's an extended attribute, in order to see any embedded labels\r\nin the tarball one needs to use `tar -tf -v --selinux`!\r\nSomehow I had apparently avoided learning this until now.  (ostree's\r\nmodel I think is better than tar's, but here we're intersecting them)\r\n\r\nAnyways.  None of this is fixed right now.  Yes, I can see the\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nBut - in preparation for making the test suite more robust and\r\nfixing things up, factor out the fixture as a separate module.\r\nMake things like the testref a method instead of using a constant.\r\n\r\nPort the diff test to use this too.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreedev/ostree-rs-ext/issues/243/reactions",

Each object is keyed by the checksum of its content, allowing\r\nfor multiple references.\r\n\r\n`.file-xattrs-link` are hardlinks which are associated to `file` objects.\r\nEach object is keyed by the same checksum of the corresponding file\r\nobject. The target of the hardlink is an existing `file-xattrs` object.\r\nIn case of reaching the limit of too many links, this object could be\r\na plain file too.", "reactions": {"url":
