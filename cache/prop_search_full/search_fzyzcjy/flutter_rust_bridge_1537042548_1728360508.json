[here](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/blob/c81a186cd7146b6be23799fac89b13eda616847e/frb_dart/lib/src/dart_opaque/_common.dart#L8) which i was able to confirm with additional logging:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndecodeDartOpaque toInt call 12970367442122235088 => 9223372036854775807\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that for some reason most targets tend to create pointer with values that fit into u32 so it works fine on macOs on Intel silicon, Linux and android x86_64 thats probably why this problem was able to stay under the radar.\r\n\r\nThats also possible that the same exact problem might happen in some other places, since passing pointers as usize is a pretty common thing i believe, but with this fix all my tests pass and app is working properly. However there might be some other scenarios that im not aware of (perhaps when using other codecs?).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] An issue to be fixed by this PR is listed above.\r\n- [ ] New tests are added to ensure new features are working.
