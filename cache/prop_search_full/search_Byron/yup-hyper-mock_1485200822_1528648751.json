It's very much a WIP with lots of hacks and doesn't even fully compile yet.\r\n\r\nI was trying to build a `Service` for `SequentialConnector` as the first example of the right path. Initial version just dumped the buffer straight in the `call`, but then Hyper complains because it hasn't gotten around to sending out it's request yet. I then built `MockHttpStream` to be a `AsyncRead/Write` stream that would wait until the request came in, then send out the response immediately. This sometimes worked, but never appeared to get the call for the response after the request came in, so I wrapped it in `MockPollStream`, which now gets the response data request. However, the response bit never gets called again, so it can't send Hyper the 0-length read that means EOF and so it stalls there entirely.\r\n\r\nRight now, only the `connector` test even compiles (I could do the `macros` bit, but I was still reshuffling things and wanted to reduce the rewrite time until I've got an approach figured out). Advised command line to see everything it does is\r\n`RUST_LOG=trace,jobserver=warn,rustc=warn,cargo=warn cargo test --test connector -- --nocapture`\r\n\r\nI've spent some time digging through Tokio, mio and Hyper, and really can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.
