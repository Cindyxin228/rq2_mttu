This is encapsulated with new `ValidatedRetryPolicy` type. `RetryPolicyExt` trait is removed and `should_retry` function is moved to `ValidatedRetryPolicy`. The lang side will now see the modified retry policy with defaults applied.\r\n- For non-local activities and for workflow activations, a safeguard was added to ensure `initial_interval` is always present in retry policy even if it was missing in server message. Note that this is different from the whole retry policy being missing (which can happen on old server versions).\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n<!-- Tell your future self why have you made these changes -->\r\nIt ensures the retry policy stored in local activity info is the same as the one actually used for retries. It also allows lang side to assume the invariant that a retry policy always has some initial interval set.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- add/delete as needed --->\r\n1.

is a significant code change, please **make sure there is an open issue** for this. \r\nWe work best with you when we have accepted the idea first before you code. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- For ALL Contributors \ud83d\udc47 -->\r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\nThis PR allows configuring [gRPC binary metadata key/values](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/grpc/grpc/+/HEAD/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#:~:text=Applications%20define%20binary%20headers%20by%20having%20their%20names%20end%20with%20%E2%80%9C%2Dbin%E2%80%9D.%20Runtime%20libraries%20use%20this%20suffix%20to%20detect%20binary%20headers%20and%20properly%20apply%20base64%20encoding%20%26%20decoding%20as%20headers%20are%20sent%20and%20received.) (where the key ends in `-bin`) on the Temporal client struct. It's already possible for Rust users of the Temporal client struct to set per-request gRPC binary metadata key/values; this allows setting client-wide headers.\r\n\r\nThe main API changes are:\r\n- Added: `ClientOptions.binary_headers: Option<HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>>`\r\n- Added: `ConfiguredClient::set_binary_headers(&self, binary_headers: HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>) -> Result<(), InvalidHeaderError>`\r\n- Added: `InvalidHeaderError`\r\n- Modified: `ConfiguredClient::set_headers` (for setting ASCII headers) now returns `Err(InvalidHeaderError)` if the keys or values are invalid, **and no headers are modified**. Before, it would just silently discard/skip invalid keys or values.\r\n- Modified: `ClientOptions::connect` (and the related methods) now returns an `Err(ClientInitError::InvalidHeaders(InvalidHeaderError))` if any of the keys or values passed in `ClientOptions` are invalid\r\n\r\nThe approach taken is to parse the metadata keys/values early, and store an already-parsed representation (that can be infallibly applied to the outbound metadata, in `ClientHeaders ::apply_to_metadata`).\r\n\r\nThis PR is depended on by https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/1070\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/991\r\n\r\n(for the specific parts in Core SDK that are needed for the Python SDK; this doesn't cover all Core-SDK changes that are needed (for e.g. the Rust SDK or the C bridge)).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n1. ~~Closes~~\r\n   - This is a partial implementation of https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/991, and is a prereq to closing https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1063\r\n\r\n2. How was this tested:\r\n    - See added/modified unit tests in `client/src/lib.rs`\r\n    - Existing tests pass (so the behavior for ASCII headers shouldn't have regressed)\r\n    - In https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/1070, I modified the client tests to cover both per-request gRPC binary metadata and client-wide gRPC binary metadata\r\n\r\n3. Any docs updates needed?\r\n    - I don't think so? Afaik there are no docs on the Core SDK from a \"Rust integrators\" perspective. The updates to docs.rs should be sufficient IMO.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/997/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

This way we can properly replace a client the `SharedNamespaceWorker` uses when replacing the client of a regular worker.\r\n\r\nA follow up PR will address filling out the rest of the heartbeat data, most of the remaining pieces require an implementation of storing metrics in memory so we can pull that data on each heartbeat.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n<!-- Tell your future self why have you made these changes -->\r\nWorker heartbeat.

In the case of cancel handler failure, that failure will be thrown out of the operation handle future and the user will not be able to use the handle to access any terminal state that the operation might reach.\r\n\r\nAlso modifies the `fsm!` macro to allow the same union type to be constructed twice, since `Started -> Started|Cancelled` is now caused by two different inputs.\r\n\r\nThe real test coverage for this PR is coming in https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/981 [Draft].\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr><td><b>Before</b></td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n<img width=\"1168\" height=\"991\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee40ee7f-0068-463d-afec-bb7ffa4cd2bd\" />\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr\r\n  <tr><td><b>After</b></td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"942\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0ddbe6b-4a2f-4842-a08e-5dd6f892b5f6\" />\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/977/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/977/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/975", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/975/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/975/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/975/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/975", "id": 3311205575, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6jG9KO", "number": 975, "title": "Fixed compiler warnings and lints added in Rust 1.89", "user": {"login": "maciejdudko", "id": 208528910, "node_id": "U_kgDODG3mDg", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208528910?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko", "html_url": "https://github.com/maciejdudko", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maciejdudko/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-08-11T18:40:30Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-12T13:26:51Z", "closed_at": "2025-08-12T13:26:33Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/975", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/975", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/975.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/975.patch", "merged_at": "2025-08-12T13:26:33Z"}, "body": "<!--- Note to EXTERNAL Contributors -->\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR! \r\nIf it is a significant code change, please **make sure there is an open issue** for this. \r\nWe work best with you when we have accepted the idea first before you code. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- For ALL Contributors \ud83d\udc47 -->\r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\n<!-- Describe what has changed in this PR -->\r\nFixed compiler warnings and lints added in Rust 1.89, specifically:\r\n- Hidden lifetimes warning\r\n- Flattening if-let chains\r\n- Using `std::slice::from_ref` to avoid cloning\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n<!-- Tell your future self why have you made these changes -->\r\nRemoves warnings from compiler output, and CI would start failing when we upgrade to Rust 1.89.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- add/delete as needed --->\r\n\r\n2.

changed\r\n\r\n* Added `temporal_client::callback_based` module with a Tonic-compatible Tower service implementation that invokes a callback instead of making a network call\r\n* Added `connect_no_namespace_with_service_override` overload that accepts an optional callback service (and moved stuff from `connect_no_namespace` into there)\r\n* Adapted `temporal_client::metrics::GrpcMetricSvc` to work with channel or callback-based service\r\n* Added `grpc_override_callback` option in C bridge's `ClientOptions` that can be set with a C function for callback\r\n* Added supporting structures and methods to support C-based callbacks with a careful eye towards lifetimes\r\n* Added minimal test to confirm some behaviors\r\n\r\nMissing/future features:\r\n\r\n* Cancellation support - There is currently no way to notify the callback implementer when a call needs to be canceled which is an important feature. Opened #979.\r\n* Easy way to delegate to traditional Core client from inside callback - This is needed to be able to use the callback-based client as an interception mechanism for langs\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/963/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/963/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/961", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/961/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/961/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/961/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/961", "id": 3250420093, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6f81mn", "number": 961, "title": "Update after skipped WFT NDE fix", "user": {"login": "Sushisource", "id": 517683, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzY4Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/517683?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource", "html_url": "https://github.com/Sushisource", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-07-21T23:52:04Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-22T20:24:11Z", "closed_at": "2025-07-22T20:24:10Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/961", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/961", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/961.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/961.patch", "merged_at": "2025-07-22T20:24:10Z"}, "body": "<!--- Note to EXTERNAL Contributors -->\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR! \r\nIf it is a significant code change, please **make sure there is an open issue** for this. \r\nWe work best with you when we have accepted the idea first before you code. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- For ALL Contributors \ud83d\udc47 -->\r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\nDo not eagerly conclude WFT sequences when finding update accepted events if those sequences should have been skipped\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nBugfix\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- add/delete as needed --->\r\n\r\n1.

the OTel Prometheus exporter with a custom one, since theirs is no longer maintained. The custom one is essentially a copy-paste of Prom's own first-party lib, except with some modifications made to allow for the registration of metrics with overlapping labels (this is fully permitted by Prom for ingestion, mind you, just prevented client side. They have their reasons for that, which are legitimate, but taking that option away would require fully breaking our API).\r\n\r\n## Breaking\r\n* Metric `Arc<dyn XXX>` are now concrete types\r\n* `with_attributes` methods now return Results, just no good way around this. Dealing with it in lang bridges should be fairly easy though since the possibility of throwing something generally existed already.\r\n\r\n## New\r\n* All the metrics now have `adds` or `records` (as opposed to just `add`) which can be used (after `with_attributes`, typically) to record without passing labels again. This is more efficient for the prom backend. They needed a different name to avoid turbofish disambiguation nonsense.\r\n\r\nI did some testing to ensure performance isn't materially different here, and it's not in real-world situations (ex: the `workflow_load` integration test has no difference in overall runtime). That said, the specific bench I made does show that if you record a bajillion prom metrics as fast as you can from different threads, lock contention slows things down by as much as 50%. At the same time, OTel's implementation of what actually happens when you scrape prom metrics is to just basically create every single metric on demand from scratch and fill in the data, which is definitely slower than what happens now - so actual scraping should be quite a bit cheaper. TLDR: I don't have any reason to believe this would have any real impact, for anyone unless they're using custom metrics with the prom exporter and are just absolutely hammering away.\r\n\r\nIf further perf improvements are desired in the future, we could add a `bind_with_schema` kind of API which would bind a metric to a certain set of labels, and allow recording on that metric with different label values without going through a lock.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/908\r\nCloses https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/882", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/942/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/942/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/941", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/941/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/941/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/941/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/941", "id": 3164544219, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6be7c7", "number": 941, "title": "Fix wft poll balancing with maxpoll=2", "user": {"login": "mjameswh", "id": 6412169, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTIxNjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6412169?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh", "html_url": "https://github.com/mjameswh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjameswh/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-06-20T23:33:00Z", "updated_at": "2025-06-24T20:36:56Z", "closed_at": "2025-06-24T20:36:55Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/941", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/941", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/941.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/941.patch", "merged_at": "2025-06-24T20:36:55Z"}, "body": "## What was changed\r\n\r\nFix a bug that prevented `PollWorkflowTaskQueue` to the sticky task queue if `workflow_task_poller_behavior = PollerBehavior::SimpleMaximum(2)`.

The `ansi` feature was explicitly listed because it's used in the code.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nI am trying to use `core` crate from Temporal SDK in a Rust application that already uses `tracing-subscriber`. However, it fails to initialize the subscriber because `core` depends on `tracing-subscriber` with `tracing-log` feature enabled. This behavior is documented [here](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/util/trait.SubscriberInitExt.html#method.try_init):\r\n\r\n> This method panics if a global default subscriber has already been set, or if a log logger has already been set (when the \u201ctracing-log\u201d feature is enabled).\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, `core` would not depend on `tracing-subscribers` since it is a [library](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing?tab=readme-ov-file#in-libraries), but I propose this as an immediate fix.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/877/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/877/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/876", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/876/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/876/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/876/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/876", "id": 2846031829, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6K1oRU", "number": 876, "title": "Run CI on all platforms", "user": {"login": "Sushisource", "id": 517683, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzY4Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/517683?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource", "html_url": "https://github.com/Sushisource", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2025-02-11T17:25:03Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-11T20:52:58Z", "closed_at": "2025-02-11T20:52:57Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/876", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/876", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/876.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/876.patch", "merged_at": "2025-02-11T20:52:57Z"}, "body": "<!--- Note to EXTERNAL Contributors -->\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR! \r\nIf it is a significant code change, please **make sure there is an open issue** for this. \r\nWe work best with you when we have accepted the idea first before you code. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- For ALL Contributors \ud83d\udc47 -->\r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\n<!-- Describe what has changed in this PR -->\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nWhy not\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- add/delete as needed --->\r\n\r\n1.

command indicating that `CancelChildWorkflowExecution` should be prefered for cancellation of child workflows, and removed the `child_workflow_id` target on the former to avoid confusion.\n\n\n## Why\n\n- As part of #331, we simplified child workflow cancellation command so that lang would simply request cancellation of the child workflow, and core would decide either to actually emit a cancellation command to the server. However, `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution.target.child_workflow_id` has not been removed, and no comment had been added, resulting in some confusion as to which API should be used in new code.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/849/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/849/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/848", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/848/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/848/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/848/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/848", "id": 2684153167, "node_id": "PR_kwDOE54S1c6C2rLi", "number": 848, "title": "Add command-events speculative WFT flag", "user": {"login": "Sushisource", "id": 517683, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzY4Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/517683?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource", "html_url": "https://github.com/Sushisource", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sushisource/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-11-22T18:26:23Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-16T22:06:57Z", "closed_at": "2025-01-16T22:06:56Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/temporalio/sdk-core/pulls/848", "html_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/848", "diff_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/848.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/848.patch", "merged_at": "2025-01-16T22:06:56Z"}, "body": "<!--- Note to EXTERNAL Contributors -->\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR! \r\nIf it is a significant code change, please **make sure there is an open issue** for this. \r\nWe work best with you when we have accepted the idea first before you code. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- For ALL Contributors \ud83d\udc47 -->\r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\nAdded new capability to WFT responses\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nEnables features now implemented in Server\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- add/delete as needed --->\r\n\r\n1.
