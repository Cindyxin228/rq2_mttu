While it supports a lot of formats, I have only implemented the most common ones, and the ones that were easiest to integrate.\r\n\r\nI have not performed any actual comparison to other ADS-B implementations, but it seems to perform quite well on my recordings and with an RTL-SDR with the stock telescopic antenna.\r\n\r\nConsidering that many people are likely to use this example (along with the others) as an example of how to implement a decoder with FutureSDR, I think it should be as close as possible to \"idiomatic\" FutureSDR. So suggestions are very welcome. For instance, maybe it could make sense to merge some of the blocks, such as the preamble detector and demodulator.\r\n\r\nAlso note that I copied the web server code from the zigbee example and only made some minor modifications.
