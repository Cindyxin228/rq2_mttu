bandwidths, and maximum ripple.

docs](https://github.com/Geal/nom/blob/main/doc/choosing_a_combinator.md), I started writing some block docs. I've only written a few so far, but I think it's a reasonable cross-section of blocks (and I plan to write more later but I have to go get food right now).\r\n\r\nThe high points:\r\n* There's a summary table in `futuredsp::blocks` that looks quite nice, and gives a brief description of all the available blocks, as well as sorting them by type.\r\n  * Note that the major difference between this and the block listing below is twofold: One, it groups the blocks, and two, it excludes things that aren't blocks, like `MessageSourceBuilder` vs. `MessageSource`. But at the same time, it does duplicate quite a bit of information.\r\n* Each block's docs has a standardized:\r\n  * Description,\r\n  * list of inputs & outputs (including marking which are message inputs/output),\r\n  * and usage code sample.\r\n* Also, the `doc(cfg())` gives us the nice little purple tag that says what features are required. There is a `doc_auto_cfg` feature, but it doesn't seem to pick up the features well, so in my limited experimenting we do have to manually specify it. The method for enabling it on docs.rs is stolen from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61417452/how-to-get-a-feature-requirement-tag-in-the-documentation-generated-by-cargo-do).\r\n\r\nTo generate the docs locally, you can run e.g.:\r\n```\r\n$ RUSTDOCFLAGS=\"--cfg docsrs\" cargo +nightly doc\r\n```\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879600/158028585-e16c90a7-6fe3-43a8-9347-6b5bd46f20a1.png)\r\n\r\nBlock documentation:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879600/158028772-0720ccd8-4725-469b-9b3f-4622ef841ed5.png)\r\n\r\n(also, note that some of the links for the FIR documentation are currently broken, because they refer to some things I'm still working on in another branch)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/39/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/39/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/36", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/36/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/36/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/36/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/36", "id": 1149886950, "node_id": "PR_kwDOF96LAc4zb8Ei", "number": 36, "title": "Consider no_std in futuredsp", "user": {"login": "phlorian", "id": 65425557, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDI1NTU3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65425557?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian", "html_url": "https://github.com/phlorian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phlorian/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-02-24T23:54:33Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-28T08:16:47Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-28T08:16:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pulls/36", "html_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/36", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/36.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/36.patch", "merged_at": "2022-02-28T08:16:43Z"}, "body": "This PR is changing the fir in futuredsp to no_std.\r\n\r\nThe motivation is to keep this crate as platform independent as possible, especially also ready for bare metal programming.

It also adds support for multiple sample types (adding `Complex<f32>`), and in the future could potentially be extended to support other types. And there's support for both dynamic and static taps. (with `[f32; N]` taps, I didn't see any slowdown over the previous implementation when compiled with `+nightly`)\r\n\r\nIn particular, the actual FIR kernel portion is factored into a separate trait, and the FIR block itself is simply a templated wrapper around it which handles the IO portion. (really, at a high level, the `Fir` struct is now just an optimized version of the `Apply` struct. But for now I haven't thought that far) Right now, all `Fir` blocks use the same `FirKernelCore`, however I'm imagining that in the future there could be SIMD implementations and resampling implementations and so on and so forth. (I'd be willing to maintain `FirKernel` as a separate crate, if you don't think it belongs here. Conceivably it could eventually get quite far into the weeds)\r\n\r\nAnyway. There's a couple things in particular I'm not the hugest fan of, mostly the code duplication all over the place, but I thought I'd at least post this and see if it's in the right direction.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/29/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/29/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/28", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/28/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/28/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/issues/28/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/28", "id": 1118673752, "node_id": "PR_kwDOF96LAc4xzG29", "number": 28, "title": "Support multi-byte items in FileSink and FileSource", "user": {"login": "lkolbly", "id": 879600, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTYwMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/879600?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly", "html_url": "https://github.com/lkolbly", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lkolbly/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-01-30T18:56:03Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-31T16:17:58Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-31T16:13:22Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pulls/28", "html_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/28", "diff_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/28.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/FutureSDR/FutureSDR/pull/28.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-31T16:13:22Z"}, "body": "This change adds a `T` parameter to `FileSinkBuilder` and `FileSourceBuilder` to set the item size for the built objects. Additionally, this PR modifies the blocks to support item sizes other than 1. For the most part, the only change needed to support that was properly dividing by the item size when advancing the streams - although the blocks access the streams as slices of `u8`, the streams are internally aware of the item size.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for `FileSource`, this PR makes the source silently finish when it received EOF, rather than panic. `read_exact` doesn't tell us how many bytes are read, so we are forced to drop whatever bytes were read and finish the stream.
