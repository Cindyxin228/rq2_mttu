You can annotate system parameters like `Res<'static, X>` and suddenly we have a static pointer to a non-static resource! Thats bad!\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, I have adopted a \"Fetch\" pattern for SystemParams (the pattern used by WorldQueries).\r\n\r\nThis accomplishes two things:\r\n* Makes it impossible to convert a function with static references to a system\r\n* Removes the need to hack lifetimes inside of SystemParams, making the implementation much safer.\r\n\r\nThere is one major downside to this approach. We can no longer use this syntax:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.add_system(movement)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead we must go back to doing this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.add_system(movement.system())\r\n```\r\n\r\nYeah yeah ... I'm not happy about it either. But safety comes first. I'm hoping we find a [magic implementation with no compromises](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1032#issuecomment-744973676), but until then something needs to give. And it can't be safety! \r\n\r\nI encourage anyone interested to play around with the \"minimal\" examples in the link above.

Additionally it was cumbersome for the \"common case\", which is \"appending systems to a state's lifecycle event stage\". This pr aims to improve the situation:\r\n\r\n## This PR\r\n\r\n### remove IntoStage trait\r\n\r\nBuilder functions that need Stages now just take stages directly instead of taking IntoStage. IntoStage made it easy to use either a Stage or a System when stages are needed, but it caused more confusion than it was worth.\r\n\r\n### StateStages now have default SystemStage handlers for their lifecycle events\r\n\r\nThis makes the internal implementation simpler / reduces branching. It also cuts down on user facing boilerplate.\r\n\r\n### on_state_X functions now take Systems\r\n\r\non_state_X take systems instead of Stages. These methods assume that the lifecycle stage is a SystemStage (which is true by default).\r\n\r\n### removed app.add_state()\r\n\r\nThis was too \"magical\". It created a new stage after UPDATE with an arbitrary name. This has been replaced with the less ergonomic, but _much_ clearer:\r\n```rust\r\napp\r\n    .add_resource(State::new(AppState::Menu))\r\n    .add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, STAGE, StateStage::<AppState>::default())\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// generally this is the only pattern people will need\r\napp\r\n    .add_resource(State::new(AppState::Menu))\r\n    .add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, STAGE, StateStage::<AppState>::default())\r\n    .on_state_enter(STAGE, AppState::Menu, setup_menu)\r\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::Menu, menu)\r\n    .on_state_exit(STAGE, AppState::Menu, cleanup_menu)\r\n    .on_state_enter(STAGE, AppState::InGame, setup_game)\r\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::InGame, movement)\r\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::InGame, change_color)\r\n\r\n\r\n// for more complicated scenarios you can do things like this\r\napp\r\n    .add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, STAGE, StateStage::<AppState>::default())\r\n    .stage(STAGE, |stage: &mut StateStage<AppState>|\r\n        stage\r\n            .on_state_enter(AppState::Menu, some_system)\r\n

based on draw.is_visible. If something is initially invisible, it will show up in RenderResourcesNode's `Changed<T>` query then get filterered out because draw.is_visible is false.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to also update bindings when visibility changes. We can't use `Changed<Draw>`, because it changes every frame (when draw commands are queued). Therefore, it makes sense to break out the Visibility fields so we can respond to their changes separately.\r\n\r\nThis also just feels cleaner because draw commands and \"visibility state\" are tangentially related concepts at best.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1034/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1034/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1033", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1033/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1033/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1033/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1033", "id": 759883212, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTM0ODA4NzY4", "number": 1033, "title": "update `Window`'s `width` & `height` methods to return `f32`", "user": {"login": "blunted2night", "id": 266735, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjczNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266735?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night", "html_url": "https://github.com/blunted2night", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blunted2night/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1795619326, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature", "name": "C-Feature", "color": "b8b8b8", "default": false, "description": "A new feature, making something new possible"}, {"id": 2272055811, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDU1ODEx", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Windowing", "name": "A-Windowing", "color": "c6a751", "default": false, "description": "Platform-agnostic interface layer to run your app in"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2020-12-09T00:14:46Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-14T02:56:26Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-13T23:05:57Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/pulls/1033", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1033", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1033.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1033.patch", "merged_at": "2020-12-13T23:05:57Z"}, "body": "This allows for better precision of the width and height when the scaling factor and physical resolution come together to produce a logical resolution that is not an integer. Admittedly, this will have little effect on most usages. An issue would occur if things were being laid out relative to the right or bottom edge. In this case it would be common to subtract some offset from the width or height.\r\n\r\nIt was requested to provide a demonstration of the ill effects this PR would resolve. Producing an example in engine is difficult (for me at least) and unreliable due to having no control over the scaling factor. Instead I created the following illustration of a scenario where trouble could occur.\r\n\r\nIn the example below imagine a line is being placed along the right most edge by subtracting 0.4 logical pixels (0.5 physical pixels) from the width to get the line to fall in the middle of the last pixel. Because the width is not precise enough the bounds of the line do not align with the pixel grid. This causes the line to bleed into the neighboring pixels and not achieve the target color.\r\n\r\n![pixel-alignment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/266735/101555249-1b780100-396d-11eb-8b97-ddabd504e07a.png)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1033/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1033/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1027", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1027/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1027/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1027/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1027", "id": 758945391, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTM0MDI1OTgy", "number": 1027, "title": "Use shaderc for aarch64-apple-darwin.", "user": {"login": "frewsxcv", "id": 416575, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/416575?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv", "html_url": "https://github.com/frewsxcv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1795619326, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature", "name": "C-Feature", "color": "b8b8b8", "default": false, "description": "A new feature, making something new possible"}, {"id": 2045383863, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering", "name": "A-Rendering", "color": "C6A751", "default": false, "description": "Drawing game state to the screen"}, {"id": 2272061383, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDYxMzgz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/O-MacOS", "name": "O-MacOS", "color": "2e6991", "default": false, "description": "Specific to the MacOS (Apple) desktop operating system"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-12-08T00:02:18Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-09T21:19:23Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-09T21:02:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/pulls/1027", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1027", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1027.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1027.patch", "merged_at": "2020-12-09T21:02:43Z"}, "body": "As suggested by @cart and @mockersf in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/928, this pull request switches Apple Silicon devices to use shaderc instead of bevy-glsl-to-spirv.

Please let me know if you can think of improvements or gaps.\r\n\r\n## Bevy Schedule V2\r\n\r\nBevy's old `Schedule` was simple, easy to read, and easy to use. But it also had significant limitations:\r\n* Only one Schedule allowed\r\n* Very static: you are limited to using the tools we gave you (stages are lists of systems, you can add stages to schedules)\r\n* Couldn't switch between schedules at runtime\r\n* Couldn't easily support \"fixed timestep\"  scenarios\r\n\r\nV2 of Bevy Schedule aims to solve these problems while still maintaining the ergonomics we all love:\r\n\r\n### Stage Trait\r\n\r\nStage is now a trait. You can implement your own stage types!\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct MyStage;\r\n\r\nimpl Stage for MyStage {\r\n    fn run(&mut self, world: &mut World, resources: &mut Resources);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere are now multiple built in Stage types:\r\n\r\n#### SystemStage\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// runs systems in parallel\r\nlet parallel_stage =\r\n    SystemStage::parallel()\r\n        .with_system(a)\r\n        .with_system(b);\r\n\r\n// runs systems serially (in registration order)\r\nlet serial_stage =\r\n    SystemStage::serial()\r\n        .with_system(a)\r\n        .with_system(b);\r\n\r\n// you can also write your own custom SystemStageExecutor\r\nlet custom_executor_stage =\r\n    SystemStage::new(MyCustomExecutor::new())\r\n        .with_system(a)\r\n        .with_system(b);\r\n```\r\n#### StateStage&lt;T&gt;\r\n\r\nBevy now supports states. More on this below!\r\n\r\n#### Schedule\r\n\r\nYou read that right! Schedules are also stages, which means you can nest Schedules\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet schedule = Schedule::default()\r\n    .with_stage(\"update\", SystemStage::parallel()\r\n        .with_system(a)\r\n        .with_system(b)\r\n    )\r\n    .with_stage(\"nested\",\r\n        Schedule::default()\r\n            .with_stage(\"nested_stage\", SystemStage::serial()\r\n                .with_system(b)\r\n            )\r\n    );\r\n\r\n// schedule stages can be downcasted\r\nlet mut update_stage = schedule.get_stage_mut::<SystemStage>(\"update\").unwrap();\r\nupdate_stage.add_system(something_new);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### States\r\n\r\nBy popular demand, we now support `State`s!\r\n\r\n* Each state value has its own \"enter\", \"update\", and \"exit\" schedule\r\n* You can queue up state changes from any system\r\n* When a StateStage runs, it will dequeue all state changes and run through each state's lifecycle\r\n* If at the end of a StateStage, new states have been queued, _they will immediately be applied_. This means moving between states will not be delayed across frames.\r\n\r\nThe new `state.rs` example is the best illustrator of this feature. It shows how to transition between a Menu state and an InGame state. The `texture_atlas.rs` example has been adapt to use states to transition between a Loading state and a Finished state.\r\n\r\nThis enables much more elaborate app models:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\r\nenum AppState {\r\n    Loading,\r\n    InGame,\r\n} \r\n\r\nApp::build()\r\n    // This initializes the state (adds the State<AppState> resource and adds StateStage<T> to the schedule)\r\n    // State stages are added right after UPDATE by default, but you also manually add StateStage<T> anywhere\r\n    .add_state(AppState::Loading)\r\n    // A state's \"enter\" schedule is run once when the state is entered\r\n    .state_enter(AppState::Loading, SystemStage::parallel()\r\n        .with_system(setup)     \r\n        .with_system(load_textures)     \r\n    )\r\n    // A state's \"update\" schedule is run once on every app update\r\n    // Note: Systems implement IntoStage, so you can do this:\r\n    .state_update(AppState::Loading, check_asset_loads)\r\n    // A state's \"exit\" schedule is run once when the state is exited \r\n    .state_exit(AppState::Loading, setup_world)\r\n    .state_update(AppState::InGame, SystemStage::parallel()\r\n        .with_system(movement)\r\n        .with_system(collision)\r\n    )\r\n    // You can of course still compose your schedule \"normally\"\r\n    .add_system(do_thing)\r\n    // add_system_to_stage assumes that the stage is a SystemStage\r\n    .add_system_to_stage(stage::POST_UPDATE, do_another_thing)\r\n\r\n// this system checks to see if assets are loaded and transitions to the InGame state when they are finished \r\nfn check_asset_loads(state: Res<State<AppState>>, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {\r\n    if assets_finished_loading(&asset_server) {\r\n        // state changes are put into a queue, which the StateStage consumes during execution\r\n        state.queue(AppState::InGame)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup_world(commands: &mut Commands, state: Res<State<AppState>>, textures: Res<Assets<Textures>>) {\r\n    // This system only runs after check_asset_loads has checked that all assets have loaded\r\n    // This means we can now freely access asset data\r\n    let texture = textures.get(SOME_HANDLE).unwrap();\r\n\r\n    commands\r\n        .spawn(Camera2dBundle::default())\r\n        // spawn more things here\r\n        .spawn(SpriteBundle::default());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Run Criteria\r\n\r\nCriteria driven stages (and schedules): only run stages or schedules when a certain criteria is met. \r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp\r\n    .add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, \"only_on_10_stage\", SystemStage::parallel()\r\n        .with_run_criteria(|value: Res<usize>| if *value == 10 { ShouldRun::Yes } else { ShouldRun::No } )\r\n        .with_system(a)\r\n    )\r\n    .add_stage_after(stage::RUN_ONCE, \"one_and_done\", Schedule::default()\r\n        .with_run_criteria(RunOnce::default())\r\n        .with_system(a)\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fixed Timestep:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, \"fixed_update\", SystemStage::parallel()\r\n    .with_run_criteria(FixedTimestep::steps_per_second(40.0))\r\n    .with_system(a)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Schedule Building\r\n\r\nAdding stages now takes a Stage value:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nApp::build()\r\n    .add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, SystemStage::parallel())\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTyped stage building with nesting:\r\n```rust\r\napp\r\n    .stage(\"my_stage\", |my_stage: &mut Schedule|\r\n        my_stage\r\n            .add_stage_after(\"substage1\", \"substage2\", SystemStage::parallel()\r\n                .with_system(some_system)\r\n            )\r\n            .add_system_to_stage(\"substage_2\", some_other_system)\r\n            .stage(\"a_2\", |a_2: &mut SystemStage| \r\n                a_2.add_stage(\"a_2_1\", StateStage::<MyState>::default())\r\n            )\r\n    )\r\n    .add_stage(\"b\", SystemStage::serial())\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Unified Schedule\r\n\r\nNo more separate \"startup\" schedule! It has been moved into the main schedule with a RunOnce criteria\r\n\r\nstartup_stage::STARTUP (and variants) have been removed in favor of this:\r\n```rust\r\napp\r\n    // this:\r\n    .add_startup_system(setup)\r\n    // is equivalent to this:\r\n    .stage(stage::STARTUP, |startup: &mut Schedule| {\r\n        startup.add_system_to_stage(startup_stage::STARTUP, setup)\r\n    }) \r\n    // choose whichever one works for you!\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is a non-breaking change. you can continue using the AppBuilder .add_startup_system() shorthand\r\n\r\n### Discussion Topics\r\n\r\n* General API thoughts: What do you like? What do you dislike?\r\n* Do States behave as expected? Are they missing anything?\r\n* Does FixedTimestep behave as expected?\r\n* I added support for \"owned builders\" _and_ \"borrowed builders\" for most schedule/stage building: \r\n    ```rust\r\n    // borrowed (add_x and in some cases set_x)\r\n    app\r\n        .add_stage(\"my_stage\", SystemStage::parallel())\r\n        .stage(\"my_stage\", |my_stage: &mut Schedule|\r\n            my_stage\r\n                .add_stage(\"a\", )\r\n                .add_system_to_stage(\"a\", some_system)\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    // owned (with_x)\r\n    app\r\n        .add_stage(\"my_stage\", Schedule::default()\r\n            .with_stage(\"a\", SystemStage::parallel())\r\n            .with_system_in_stage(\"a\", some_system)\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n    ```\r\n    * Does this make sense? We could remove with_x in favor of borrowed add_x in most cases. This would reduce the api surface, but it would mean slightly more cumbersome initialization.

This causes the swap chain to fail to resize until the window resized again to a \"good\" resolution. The issue is caused by the logical size being stored as an integer which looses precision when calculated from the physical size.\r\n\r\nThis patch attempts to solve the issue by storing the physical resolution of the window instead of the logical resolution. As part of the effort, `width` & `height` become `logical_width` & `logical_height`, `scaled_width` & `scaled_height` become `physical_width` & `physical_height`. This requires touching a number of things and will probably break downstream users. It also changes the type of the components of the logical size to `f32` so it can better represent sizes that are a fraction of a pixel.", "reactions": {"url":

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[0.11.0] - 2020-11-26</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>is_finite</code> method to all types which returns <code>true</code> if, and only if,\nall contained elements are finite.</li>\n<li>Added <code>exp</code> and <code>powf</code> methods for all vector types.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>is_nan</code> method now returns a <code>bool</code> to match the new <code>is_finite</code> method\nand to be consistent with the same methods on the <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> primitive\ntypes.</li>\n<li>Renamed <code>is_nan</code> which returns a vector mask to <code>is_nan_mask</code>.</li>\n<li>Don't use the <code>cfg</code> definitions added by <code>build.rs</code> for definining structs as\n<code>rust-analyzer</code> is not aware of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed deprecated accessor methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.10.2] - 2020-11-17</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated element accessor members <code>.x()</code>, <code>.x_mut()</code>, <code>.set_x()</code>, etc. on\nvector and quaternion types.</li>\n<li>Deprecated column accessor members <code>.x_axis()</code>, <code>.x_axis_mut()</code>,\n<code>.set_x_axis()</code>, etc. on matrix types.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.10.1] - 2020-11-15</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the <code>Vec2::perp</code> method which returns a <code>Vec2</code> perpendicular to <code>self</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Vec2</code> and <code>Vec3</code> types were changed to use public named fields for <code>.x</code>,\n<code>.y</code>, and <code>.z</code> intead of accessors.</li>\n<li><code>Quat</code>, <code>Vec3A</code> and <code>Vec4</code> implement <code>Deref</code> and <code>DerefMut</code> for the new <code>XYZ</code>\nand <code>XYZW</code> structs to emulate public named field access.</li>\n<li><code>Mat3</code> and <code>Mat4</code> had their axis members made pubic intead of needing\naccessors.</li>\n<li><code>Mat2</code> implements <code>Deref</code> and <code>DerefMut</code> for the new <code>XYAxes</code> struct to\nemulate public named field access.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed deprecated <code>length_reciprocal</code> and <code>sign</code> methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

mesh specialization when it needs to **(static: 0.0250, dynamic: 0.0331)**\r\n* Stop clearing bind groups every frame and remove stale bind groups every other frame. **(static: 0.0265)**\r\n  * this is slightly more expensive on bevymark, but i think its probably still the right thing to do. ill keep an eye on this.\r\n* Store unmatched render resource binding results (which prevents redundant computations per-entity per-frame) **(static: 0.02411)**\r\n* Don't send render pass state change commands when the state has not actually changed **(static: 0.0179, dynamic: 0.0227)** ", "reactions":

update they are in the stage `POST_UPDATE`. It makes sense, because it make sure they run after potential creation/update of `Transform` that would happen during the `UPDATE` stage.\r\n\r\nBut when running at startup, these two systems were in the default (`STARTUP`) stage. So if the user spawn entities during that stage (which is very likely, since it's the default), then the entities spawned by the user may have a incorrect `GlobalTransform` for the first update.\r\n\r\nThis discrepency looks very much like a small mistake. I assume that, If it is correct to run these two system during the `POST_UPDATE` of each update, then the correct things to do at startup is to run during the `POST_STARTUP`.\r\n\r\nI hope it makes sense.\r\n\r\nThanks for this awseome work!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/955/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/955/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/954", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/954/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/954/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/954/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/954", "id": 752992394, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI5MTYxNzQ2", "number": 954, "title": "Rename reflect 'hash' method to 'reflect_hash'", "user": {"login": "CleanCut", "id": 5838512, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU4Mzg1MTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5838512?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut", "html_url": "https://github.com/CleanCut", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": true}, "labels": [{"id": 2287994822, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg3OTk0ODIy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Code-Quality", "name": "C-Code-Quality", "color": "B8B8B8", "default": false, "description": "A section of code that is hard to understand or change"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2020-11-29T19:49:38Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-01T19:15:08Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-01T19:15:08Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/pulls/954", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/954", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/954.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/954.patch", "merged_at": "2020-12-01T19:15:08Z"}, "body": "@cart is this what you had in mind to resolve #943?

change continuing on from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/892\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this change is that if we have just a single task to perform, it's almost always better to perform it immediately rather than pass the work to another thread and blocking-wait on it (thereby tying up two threads.)\r\n\r\nI don't see significant gains (or losses) from this in practice when profiling. To me the data indicates that the main thread is already consistently picking up the task before a worker thread can (and doesn't appear that we are even waking another thread?) While the benefits from thread behavior are inconclusive, this does remove some allocations when hitting the fast path of <= 1 task to perform in a scope. \r\n\r\n# Original\r\n\r\nThis is a baseline from before we fixed the deadlock.

I actually already integrated it, but there were two problems:\r\n  1. `inventory` (and the general approach it uses) has a [show-stopping rustc bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47384)\r\n  2. `inventory` (and the general approach it uses) doesn't support wasm\r\n* It would be nice to add \"enum reflection\" (with a new Enum trait) to remove the need to treat them as value types\r\n* Map value insertion\r\n* More \"reflect trait\" impls (Default, Debug)\r\n* Integrate TypeUuid with TypeRegistry (optional)\r\n* Consider implicitly including the ReflectComponent attribute value in Bevy to reduce the amount of boilerplate required\r\n* \"diff\" reflected structs and produce a DynamicStruct", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/926/reactions", "total_count": 11, "+1": 10, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/926/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/923", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/923/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/923/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/923/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/923", "id": 749993095, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI2NzE4MzY5", "number": 923, "title": "Improve Timer ergonomics", "user": {"login": "CleanCut", "id": 5838512, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU4Mzg1MTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5838512?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut", "html_url": "https://github.com/CleanCut", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CleanCut/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": true}, "labels": [{"id": 1795619326, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature", "name": "C-Feature", "color": "b8b8b8", "default": false, "description": "A new feature, making something new possible"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 10, "created_at": "2020-11-24T19:53:30Z", "updated_at": "2020-11-26T06:56:21Z", "closed_at": "2020-11-26T00:43:17Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/pulls/923", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/923", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/923.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/923.patch", "merged_at": "2020-11-26T00:43:17Z"}, "body": "I often use timers to drive animation by converting it to a percentage. The fact that `elapsed` could exceed `duration` for non-repeating timers means that I had to check for that everywhere I used them, or the percentage could go negative (which can do various unexpected things, such as flip vector direction). This is a paper cut for me, so I made this PR which:\r\n\r\n- Clamps `elapsed` to the range `[0.0, duration]`\r\n- Adds tests\r\n- Adds _some_ documentation\r\n- Adds two convenience methods: (`percent` and `percent_left`)\r\n  - I was on the fence whether to include these methods in the PR due to the fact that it assumes keeping the size of `Timer` small is more important than the speed of the calculation. A more speed-optimized approach would store the inverse of duration and do multiplication.  Is there a general principle we're following that could inform the approach? Or should we leave the methods out altogether?\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/923/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/923/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/920", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/920/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/920/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/920/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/920", "id": 749181672, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI2MDQwODM3", "number": 920, "title": "wgpu: use mailbox instead of fifo for vsync", "user": {"login": "cart", "id": 2694663, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart", "html_url": "https://github.com/cart", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2045383863, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering", "name": "A-Rendering", "color": "C6A751", "default": false, "description": "Drawing game state to the screen"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-11-23T22:43:58Z", "updated_at": "2020-11-26T01:28:59Z", "closed_at": "2020-11-26T01:28:59Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/pulls/920", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/920", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/920.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/920.patch", "merged_at": "2020-11-26T01:28:59Z"}, "body": "This has lower latency (for the platforms that support it).

In particular, it treats nodes without children and nodes with empty children lists differently, and it effectively discards the results of previous computations when it progresses from one hierarchy tree to the next. I think that was not intentional and changed it to a system where the global z for each node increases by 1 in each step in a depth first traversal. I also added a unit test to make the changes in behavior transparent. \r\nTwo open points:\r\n* The ordering of the root nodes is somewhat arbitrary (depends on archetypes and entity index, I suppose). From a user perspective I would expect that more recently spawned UI elements are shown in front, or alternatively that I could set an order and put elements in front.\r\n* The depth system traverses the children of nodes without transforms, the transform-propagate system does not. This could be fixed by moving the children query inside the if-let statement that checks for the transform. Alternatively, the propagate system could be changed to treat missing transforms as the identity.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/905/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/905/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/904", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/904/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/904/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/904/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/904", "id": 747977455, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI1MTAwNTQx", "number": 904, "title": "Fix duplicated chilren in Scene spawn", "user": {"login": "lassade", "id": 9643105, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDMxMDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9643105?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade", "html_url": "https://github.com/lassade", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lassade/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1795619323, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug", "name": "C-Bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": false, "description": "An unexpected or incorrect behavior"}, {"id": 2197761682, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS", "name": "A-ECS", "color": "c6a751", "default": false, "description": "Entities, components, systems, and events"}, {"id": 2272098452, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDk4NDUy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Performance", "name": "C-Performance", "color": "B8B8B8", "default": false, "description": "A change motivated by improving speed, memory usage or compile times"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-11-21T08:44:39Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-05T22:44:38Z", "closed_at": "2020-11-22T20:05:59Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/pulls/904", "html_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/904", "diff_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/904.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/904.patch", "merged_at": "2020-11-22T20:05:59Z"}, "body": "Fixes #889,\r\n\r\nTLDR;\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n1.

Performance takes a massive hit, `transform_propagate_system` took 13ms in release with a small skeleton tree ~20 bones\r\n3. Affects gltf loading\r\n4. Right now the only \"correct\" way of creating a `Scene` is using `WorldBuilder.with(Parent(...))` (still wrong for other reasons)\r\n\r\nThe Fix\r\n1. Impl `FromResources` and `MapEntities` for `PrevousParent`\r\n2. Checking for duplicates in the `Children` using a `debug_assert`\r\n3. `Children.0` and `PreviousParent.0` are now `pub(crate)`, their contents are a reflect of `Parent`\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis is the best short term fix, it will make so that the only true correct way of creating `Scene` will be `WorldBuilder.with_children` which has no caviats", "reactions": {"url":
