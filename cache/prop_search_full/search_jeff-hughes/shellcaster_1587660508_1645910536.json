About a week ago I just googled \"terminal podcast app rust\" and here it is! I'm relatively new to rust, and to contributing to other people's projects.\r\n\r\nI accidentally deleted a podcast by hitting `r` and had to re-add the feed. I was already building the 1.0.1 release locally and running that, so I thought I would poke around.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is add a `ask_for_confirmation` method on the `UI` struct that prompts the user like the \"delete local files\" prompt. Then this is used first thing in the `remove_podcast` and `remove_all_episodes` methods to confirm the remove action. This prevents accidentally removing podcasts or episodes.\r\n\r\nIf the user types 'n' or cancels then it's not confirmed and the remove is not done.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to change anything, or I can fix anything you dislike! Also no worries if this is not even something you want to do!
