If the version is 1.4.0 or higher, the `--quiet` argument is added to the `pipx upgrade-all` command to suppress non-critical output during the upgrade process, adhering to the new feature introduced in pipx 1.4.0 as per the documentation (https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/#pipx-upgrade-all). This change aims to make the upgrade process less verbose and more manageable in automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines where log brevity is beneficial.\r\n\r\n## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] The

Make the logger work while loading the configuration file\r\n  \r\n    A few days ago, I noticed that the configuration file was no longer printed in verbose mode, and found that our logger will ONLY be initialized after loading the config file, this behavior was introduced in #552, and this PR fixes it by setting our logger in 2 phases:\r\n\r\n    1. Set up it with the log level (filter directives) specified in the CLI option\r\n        ```rs\r\n        let reload_handle = install_tracing(&opt.tracing_filter_directives())?;\r\n        ```\r\n    2. Update it with the log levels specified in the CLI option and the config file\r\n        ```rs\r\n       update_tracing(&reload_handle, &config.tracing_filter_directives())?;\r\n        ```\r\n       \r\n        For more details, see the code comments\r\n2. Replace the default log level setting with a const variable `DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL`\r\n3. Style change, import `tracing::<log_macro!>` when using it", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/581/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

If a user has a custom `oh-my-zsh` installation (not `~/.oh-my-zsh`) on a remote machine and the user tries to update `oh-my-zsh` on that remote machine through topgrade, then this step will be skipped as environment variable `ZSH` is absent and the hardcoded fallback path (`~/.oh-my-zsh`) does not exist. This is pretty similar to #426 but on a remote machine, this patch also fixes it.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/496/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/496/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/495", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/495/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/495/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/495/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/495", "id": 1800463343, "node_id": "PR_kwDOIMP4Ws5VSJPF", "number": 495, "title": "Update only base conda env", "user": {"login": "marcelotrevisani", "id": 7882269, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODIyNjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7882269?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani", "html_url": "https://github.com/marcelotrevisani", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcelotrevisani/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2023-07-12T08:32:25Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-14T16:11:19Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-14T16:11:19Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pulls/495", "html_url": "https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/495", "diff_url": "https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/495.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/495.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-14T16:11:19Z"}, "body": "Please update just the base env, it is common to have others environment activated and I don't want to update them.

Unify the behavior of requiring `sudo` for steps that require `sudo`\r\n    \r\n    Before this PR, steps requiring sudo were handling it in various ways, now they all do it like this:\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    let sudo = require_option(ctx.sudo.as_ref(), REQUIRE_SUDO.to_string());\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    When `sudo` is absent, the step will be skipped with cause `REQUIRE_SUDO`: \"Require sudo or counterpart but not found, skip\"\r\n\r\n3. `src/error.rs`: `TopgradeError::SudoRequired` is removed. I think this is fine as we will have better error handling and more exit states as stated in [this PR](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/pull/456#issue-1735358287)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Changed Behavior\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is the behavior of some steps that handle `sudo` like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nif let Some(sudo) = ctx.sudo {\r\n    // do the upgrade\r\n} else {\r\n    print_warning(\"No sudo detected. Skipping system upgrade\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhas been changed in this PR.\r\n\r\nIn the previous impl, these steps exit with the state `OK` and have a warning printed, now they are `Skipped`. Honestly, I like the previous behavior, simply skipping the step is pretty confusing to the user, but again, better handling/more exit states/better UX is the future work, we will come back and deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/topgrade-rs/topgrade/issues/467/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0,

For the case where the binary is found but some conditions are not satisfied during execution (e.g., for git step, no repo is found, like the case described in this PR), we use `Skipped`.\r\n\r\nAnd for a `Skipped` step, a separator should be printed and a warning should be given to the user telling the user why this step was skipped. For a `NotFound` step, we don't need to print a separator as users don't use it at all.
