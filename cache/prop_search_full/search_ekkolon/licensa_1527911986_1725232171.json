Add a brief description of the PR -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a Windows-specific security vulnerability coming from transient dependencies that rely on the `mio` crate.\r\n\r\n> When using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used. For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash. On the other hand, for applications that store pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability may result in a use-after-free.\r\n>\r\n> For users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio.\r\n>\r\n> The vulnerability is Windows-specific, and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected.\r\n\r\n<!-- You can also choose to add a list of changes and if they have been completed or not by using the markdown to-do list syntax\r\n- [ ] Not Completed\r\n- [x] Completed\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## \u2705 Checks\r\n<!-- Make sure your pr passes the CI checks and do check the following fields as needed - -->\r\n- [x] My pull request adheres to the code style of this project\r\n- [ ] My code requires changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation as required\r\n- [ ] All the tests have passed\r\n\r\n## \u2139 Additional Information\r\n<!-- Any additional information like breaking changes, dependencies added, screenshots, comparisons between new and old behavior, etc. -->\r\nN/A", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/issues/71/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/issues/71/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/issues/69", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/issues/69/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/issues/69/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/issues/69/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ekkolon/licensa/pull/69", "id": 2165437659, "node_id": "PR_kwDOLHI1-85og-bL", "number": 69, "title": "fix(cli): invalid type error when missing exclude flag", "user": {"login": "ekkolon", "id": 18242749, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQyNzQ5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18242749?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon", "html_url": "https://github.com/ekkolon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ekkolon/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-03-03T16:22:28Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-03T16:27:38Z", "closed_at": "2024-03-03T16:27:37Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ekkolon/licensa/pulls/69", "html_url": "https://github.com/ekkolon/licensa/pull/69", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ekkolon/licensa/pull/69.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ekkolon/licensa/pull/69.patch", "merged_at": "2024-03-03T16:27:37Z"}, "body": "This PR resolves an error caused by parsing workspace configuration and merging it with user-provided CLI arguments/flags.

It contains battle tested utilities to \r\nThis pull request introduces two new modules within the workspace crate: ops and error. These modules work together to significantly improve workspace management, streamline error handling, and provide informative debugging experiences.\r\n\r\n## Key highlights\r\n\r\n- `ops` module:\r\n  - Offers essential functionalities for managing workspace configurations and ignore files.\r\n  - Simplifies interaction with Licensa configurations, improving code readability and maintainability.\r\n  - Includes features like configuration handling, error handling, and extensibility for future features.\r\n- `error` module:\r\n  - Defines custom error types specifically for Licensa workspace operations.\r\n  - Enhances error handling with clear and informative messages for debugging and troubleshooting.\r\n  - Covers various scenarios including missing files, existing configurations, data issues, and unexpected errors.\r\n  -

attempts to utilize commands with the `--year` flag or parsing the `.licensarc` configuration file would result in errors due to mishandling of the `YYYY-present` format for license years.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made:**\r\n- Resolved the issue where errors occurred during the execution of CLI commands utilizing the `--year` flag.\r\n- Fixed parsing errors encountered when reading license year periods from the `.licensarc` configuration file.\r\n- Added custom `LicenseYearError` enum\r\n\r\n**Fixes:**\r\n- CLI commands now properly handle the `--year` flag, ensuring correct (de)serialization and parsing of license years.\r\n- Parsing of license year periods from the `.licensarc` configuration file has been rectified, preventing errors and ensuring accurate interpretation of `YYYY-present` format.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- You can also choose to add a list of changes and if they have been completed or not by using the markdown to-do list syntax\r\n- [ ] Not Completed\r\n- [x]

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>42.0.0 - 2024-01-22</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  or\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should\n  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per\n  process.\n* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for\n  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the\n  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate revocation list signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Added ``mgf`` property to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS`.\n* Added ``algorithm`` and ``mgf`` properties to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.OAEP`.\n* Added the following properties that return timezone-aware ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_before_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_after_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.RevokedCertificate.revocation_date_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.next_update_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.last_update_utc`.\n  These are timezone-aware variants of existing properties that return na\u00efve\n  ``datetime`` objects.\n* Deprecated the following properties that return na\u00efve ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_before`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_after`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.RevokedCertificate.revocation_date`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.next_update`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.last_update`\n  in favor of the new timezone-aware variants mentioned above.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ChaCha20`\n  on LibreSSL.\n* Added support for RSA PSS signatures in PKCS7 with\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
