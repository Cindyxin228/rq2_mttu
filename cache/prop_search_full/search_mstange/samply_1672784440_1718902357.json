changes:\r\n\r\n1. The main trait has been renamed from ProfilerMarker to Marker, and a\r\nnew trait named StaticSchemaMarker has been added.\r\n2. The static and dynamic fields in the marker schema are now specified\r\nseparately, in the schema's `fields` and `static_fields` properties.\r\n3. You can now define schemas at runtime. Previously, the schema had to\r\nbe known at compile time.\r\n4. The marker name and category are now part of the marker, and are no\r\nlonger specified as separate arguments.\r\n5. The values for the dynamic fields are now queried from two new methods,\r\nstring_field_value and number_field_value. The previous method named\r\njson_marker_data has been removed.\r\n6. Strings are now serialized as string indexes. This saves space when\r\nmultiple markers use the same string field value.\r\n\r\nThe string deduplication reduced the JSON size from 350MB to 210MB on\r\none example profile I was testing with (4 iterations of sp3 with lots of\r\nJitFunctionAdd markers and --reuse-threads).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mstange/samply/issues/254/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

The `1080272` here is the file offset  at which this mapping starts within the synthetic file.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to work best is to interpret the vaddr values as \"relative addresses\", i.e. adjust min_vaddr and file_offset_of_min_vaddr so that when we compute the library-relative address for a stack frame inside such a mapping, we end up with the frame's absolute address.\r\n\r\nWe still treat each \"jit range path\" at a separate library, e.g. \"/data/local/tmp/perf.data_jit_app_cache:1080272-1090264\" will be a different library than \"/data/local/tmp/perf.data_jit_app_cache:1067808-1068688\". In other words, we don't try to combine multiple different ranges into a single perf.data_jit_app_cache library. Keeping the ranges separate means that we don't run into trouble if multiple processes have different JIT functions at the same in-process address; this would be trouble because the combined library might have different symbols at the same relative address.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mstange/samply/issues/248/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

https://share.firefox.dev/3RjMLuv\r\nAfter: https://share.firefox.dev/3RgpGsz\r\n\r\nsimpleperf is very eager about putting thread names in the perf.data file: When it processes the first sample in a process, it lists the threads in that process and emits COMM records for all of them, with a timestamp that matches the first sample.\r\nIt does this both for procesess that already exist when profiling starts, and for new processes that are created during profiling.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that the enumeration of threads happens long after the kernel collects the first sample - perf event records are buffered and read in chunks, so by the time simpleperf reads the sample, a long time can have elapsed.\r\nIn the meantime, a lot of new threads can already have been created - but these threads were created *after* the kernel collected the first sample. simpleperf then emits COMM events for those new threads, with the timestamp for a sample that occurred before these threads existed.\r\n\r\nsamply uses the timestamp of the first event for a each TID to mark the thread's start time. The Firefox Profiler UI shows the start of a thread visually. Since the COMM event was the first event, and since it has a timestamp that's too early, the Firefox Profiler UI was showing the thread starting too early.\r\n\r\nThis fix overwrites a thread's start time with the timestamp of the FORK record for any existing threads which don't have any samples yet.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good if simpleperf stopped emitting the extra COMM records. It could just do the existing thread enumeration only for processes that exist at the start of profiling and not for processes that get created during profiling - the kernel will emit FORK and COMM records for any new threads in those processes and those are sufficient.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mstange/samply/issues/246/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

wanted to drop the `s` suffix because I did that wrong in the first place (you can't pass a comma separated list without additional work)\r\n- makes `--coreclr` available everywhere; sets the env var for linux like macOS\r\n- adds `record --gfx` to turn on some graphics ETW providers. mostly a stub, just turns on vsync.\r\n- small refactor for macos attach code that I had sitting around, in
