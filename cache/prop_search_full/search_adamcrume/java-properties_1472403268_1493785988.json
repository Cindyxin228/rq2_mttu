Working entirely with Unicode escape sequences, especially in files with East Asian languages, is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the `NaturalLines` iterator to accept an encoding on creation, and then to read bytes into a raw buffer. Decoding only happens on EOL, rather than with each byte; this allows multibyte encodings to work as expected.\r\n\r\nEncodings can be specified by calling `PropertiesIter::new_with_encoding()`; using `PropertiesIter::new()` as before will default to `ISO-8859-1` encoding, but with the above behavior change.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/adamcrume/java-properties/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/adamcrume/java-properties/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
