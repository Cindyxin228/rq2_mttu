Feel free to cherry-pick fixes, reject what you don't like, whatever.\r\n\r\nFormatting: I ran Prettier on the JSON and Markdown files, and EvenBetterTOML on Cargo.toml. Nothing here should be too controversial.\r\n\r\nUpdating to Rust 2021 doesn't break anything, so it's best to do so. Only one dependency had a breaking release (`env_logger`), and reviewing changelogs indicates that it shouldn't break anything here either. Cargo.toml version has been bumped to reflect the actual version of the crate.\r\n\r\nChanges to documentation: put the readme into the generated documentation on docs.rs (there was a commented out attempt to do so, so perhaps it was an intentional decision? The docs.rs page looks very sparse without it, though). In general, I made as few changes as possible to appease `clippy` and make doctests run.\r\n\r\nI guess the most controversial change here is reducing redundancy in the `Display` implementation for log levels. The change will probably increase speed and reduce binary size by a non-zero, though likely negligible, amount. It's just simpler, IMO.\r\n\r\nThanks for writing this crate! I know I and the hundreds of other people who download this crate each day really appreciate your work \u2764\ufe0f", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kamek-pf/stackdriver-logger/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kamek-pf/stackdriver-logger/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
