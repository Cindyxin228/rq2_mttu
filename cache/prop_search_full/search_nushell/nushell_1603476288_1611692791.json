Notably now missing: battery info, some of the system info fields, and maybe 1(?) of the ps fields.\r\n\r\n* The reported processor memory usage differs. I noticed that current `nu` also differs from other process monitor tools I use, so perhaps different apps just count sizes differently.\r\n\r\n* We also lose the fancy `benchmark` output because it relied on uom.\r\n\r\nPerformance between the two seems relatively similar.\r\n\r\nCompile times improve noticeably.

of some refactoring or something. \r\nThe test that were present are still passing, and I added new tests to check for this particular issue. \r\nI hope that the way the tests are written isn't too

Before\r\nthere was a little bit of \"quick-and-dirty\" string-matching/parsing involved.\r\nNow, a signature is a little bit more properly parsed.\r\nThe grammar of a definition signature understood by these parsing-functions is\r\nas follows:\r\n `[ (parameter | flag | <eol>)* ]`\r\nwhere\r\nparameter is:\r\n    `name (<:> type)? (<,> | <eol> | (#Comment <eol>))?`\r\nflag is:\r\n    `--name (-shortform)? (<:> type)? (<,> | <eol> | (#Comment <eol>))?`\r\n(Note: After the last item no <,> has to come.)\r\nNote: It is now possible to pass comments to flags and parameters\r\nExample:\r\n```shell\r\n> def x [\r\nhello :int # First message\r\nworld: string # Second message\r\n--lit : path # My list flag :)\r\n] { echo hello world }\r\n\r\n> x -h\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  > x <hello> <world> {flags} \r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n  <hello> First message\r\n  <world> Second message\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -h, --help: Display this help message\r\n  --lit <file path>: My list flag :)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Sadly there seems to be a bug (Or is this expected behaviour?) in the lexer, because of which `--x(-x)` would\r\nbe treated as one baseline token and is therefore not correctly recognized as 2. For\r\nnow a space has to be inserted)\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation of the module, a question arose:\r\nShould flag/parameter names be allowed to be type names?\r\nExample case:\r\n```shell\r\ndef f [ string ] { echo $string }\r\n```\r\nCurrently an error is thrown", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/issues/2905/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/issues/2905/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/issues/2898", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/issues/2898/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/issues/2898/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/issues/2898/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/2898", "id": 782717399, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTUyMjA5MzQy", "number": 2898, "title": "Split nu-cli into nu-cli/nu-engine", "user": {"login": "sophiajt", "id": 547158, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzE1OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/547158?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt", "html_url": "https://github.com/sophiajt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sophiajt/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-01-10T01:05:52Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-10T02:50:53Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-10T02:50:50Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/pulls/2898", "html_url": "https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/2898", "diff_url": "https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/2898.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/2898.patch", "merged_at": "2021-01-10T02:50:50Z"}, "body": "We split off the evaluation engine part of nu-cli into its own crate.
