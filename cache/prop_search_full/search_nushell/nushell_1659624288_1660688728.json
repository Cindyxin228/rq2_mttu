[New in this PR] Check whether [`which-rs`](https://github.com/harryfei/which-rs) can find an executable in PATH or the cwd. `which-rs` has logic to include executable file extensions in its search, so it will find `foo.cmd` given just `foo`.

This gives us more regex functionality without the limitations that the `regex` crate imposes. The great thing about the `fancy-regex` crate is that if you don't use the \"fancy\" features, it just falls back to using the `regex` crate. The error reporting seems to be better with `fancy-regex` too. Instead of having two error variants, `fancy-regex` has 21. So, this should be a win-win. This supersedes #6221.\r\n\r\nI added a few more tests to the Examples in `parse` and `str replace`.\r\n\r\nRead more about `fancy-regex` [here](https://docs.rs/fancy-regex/0.10.0/fancy_regex/).\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nMake sure you've done the following:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add tests that cover your changes, either in the command examples, the crate/tests folder, or in the /tests folder.\r\n- [ ] Try to think about corner cases and various ways how your changes could break.
