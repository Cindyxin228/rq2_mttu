using this dependency for a project but saw that it was pretty out of date so I spent a little bit of time cleaning it up.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Migrated to latest edition\r\n- Updated all the dependencies\r\n- Removed `lazy_static` because it is no longer needed with new versions of `base64`\r\n- Fixed the feature flags to be opt-in\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nAll the units tests except the ones related to `diesel` pass. I'm getting a link error when I enable the `diesel` feature flag but I assume that they still pass if you compile the binary in the right environment.\r\n\r\n## Improved Codegen\r\nI took a look at the asm generated for this snippet on both the current version (`master`) and after these changes to see the difference in codegen:\r\n```rust\r\n// With `lto = true`\r\n#[no_mangle]\r\n#[inline(never)]\r\npub fn convert(e: UuidB64) -> InlineString {\r\n    e.to_istring()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn `master` there are lots of branch and allocation calls; meanwhile after updating `base64` the above function now only contains the following instructions on x86:\r\n`add, lea, mov, movabs, movups, movzx, or, ret, shr, sub`\r\n\r\nI haven't measured the performance difference with a benchmark but presumably this new version will be much faster.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quodlibetor/uuid-b64/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/quodlibetor/uuid-b64/issues/4/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
