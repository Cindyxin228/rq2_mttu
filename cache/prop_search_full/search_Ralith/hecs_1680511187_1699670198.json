[std::cell::RefMut::map](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefMut.html#method.map), which allow the contents of a `Ref`/`RefMut` to be transformed without reborrowing. This can make it easier to write certain kinds of functions which return data borrowed from components.\r\n\r\nAn example of this kind of code is below:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait MyComponentTrait {\r\n    fn get_state(&self) -> &dyn MyState;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn entity_get_state<T: MyComponentTrait>(ent: EntityRef<'_>) -> Option<Ref<'_, dyn MyState>> {\r\n    let component = ent.get::<&'_ T>();\r\n    component.map(|comp_ref| Ref::map(comp_ref, |comp| comp.get_state()))\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct MyComponentInstance {\r\n    // state unspecified...\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl MyComponentTrait for MyComponmentInstance {\r\n    // implementation unspecified...\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet mut comp_ty_to_state_getter: HashMap<TypeId, fn(EntityRef<'_>) -> Option<Ref<'_, dyn MyState>> = Default::default();\r\ncomp_ty_to_state_getter.insert(TypeId::of::<MyComponmentInstance>(), entity_get_state::<MyComponmentInstance>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom there, when you have an entity, you could iterate over the `TypeId`s of the components in that entity, and then\r\ncall use the `comp_ty_to_state_getter` to call common functionality on all of them. Examples of where this could\r\nbe useful include serialisation, or visiting component fields to render them in a GUI inspector.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, the sizes of the `Ref` and `RefMut` types have increased to store the `TypeId` of the original\r\ncomponent, and the `Archetype` can now be released polymorphically using that `TypeId`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is anything else I should change or if there are any tests I should add.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Ralith/hecs/issues/314/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,
