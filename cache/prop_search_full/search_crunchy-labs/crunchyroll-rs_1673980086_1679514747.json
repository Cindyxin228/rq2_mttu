This will require code changes for clients.\nFunctions <code>download</code> and <code>download_to</code> are now <code>async</code>, and you will need to call them from an\nasync context and use <code>.await</code> (see the example <code>download_bbc.rs</code> for some sample code). If you\nare passing a reqwest client to <code>DashDownloader</code> (using <code>with_http_client</code>), you should now use a\nstandard <code>Client</code> built using <code>reqwest::Client::builder()</code>, instead of using\n<code>reqwest::blocking::Client::builder()</code> as previously (see the example <code>download_proxy.rs</code> for some\nsample code). Clients will need to add an explicit dependency on the tokio crate (which was\nalready pulled in via the reqwest crate, but implicitly).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.6.4] - 2023-01-14</h2>\n<h3>New</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Preliminary support for fetching subtitles (see function <code>fetch_subtitles</code> on <code>DashDownloader</code>).\nThere is support for subtitles in WebVTT format (an AdaptationSet node with a <code>@mimeType</code>\nattribute of &quot;text/vtt&quot;), TTML (<code>@mimeType</code> of &quot;application/ttml+xml&quot;) and SAMI (<code>@mimeType</code> of\n&quot;application/x-sami&quot;). There is also some support for WVTT (binary WebVTT in a wvtt box in\nfragmented MP4 container, as specified by ISO/IEC 14496-30:2014) and for STPP format (TTML in a\nfragmented MP4 container). WVTT subtitles will be converted to SRT format using the MP4Box\ncommandline application, if it is available in the PATH.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update dependency quick-xml to v0.27</li>\n<li>Simplify serialization example using new version of the quick-xml crate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.6.3] - 2022-12-10</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: xs:datetime fields such as <code>MPD@publishTime</code> and <code>MPD@availabilityStartTime</code> without a\ntimezone are now parsed correctly instead of triggering an error. Issue seen with YouTube DASH\nmanifests, reported by erg43hergeg.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[0.6.2] - 2022-11-27</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading: implement support for <code>SegmentURL@mediaRange</code> and <code>Initialization@range</code> using HTTP\nbyte range requests. This allows us to download crazy DASH manifests that misuse Twitter's CDN by\nprepending dummy PNG headers to media segments\n(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/David3141593/status/1587978423120666625\">https://twitter.com/David3141593/status/1587978423120666625</a>).</li>\n<li>Fixed default value for <code>SegmentTemplate@startNumber</code> when downloading (1 instead of 0).</li>\n<li>Fix: an AdaptationSet may contain a SegmentList.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We now check that the HTTP content-type of downloaded segments corresponds to audio or video content.\nNew function <code>without_content_type_checks</code> on <code>DashDownloader</code> to disable these checks (may be\nnecessary with poorly configured HTTP servers).</li>\n<li>Added functions <code>keep_video</code> and <code>keep_audio</code> on <code>DashDownloader</code> to retain video and audio\nstreams on disk after muxing.</li>\n<li>Added attribute <code>Representation@mediaStreamStructureId</code>.</li>\n<li>Added attribute <code>SegmentTemplate@eptDelta</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
