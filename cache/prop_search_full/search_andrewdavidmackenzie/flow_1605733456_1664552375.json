Only the relevant slice of pixel data is passed to the encoder.</li>\n<li>Fixed a OOM-panic caused by malformed images in the <code>gif</code> decoder.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 0.24.1</h3>\n<p>Bug Fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ImageBuffer::get_pixel_checked would sometimes return the incorrect pixel.</li>\n<li>PNG encoding would sometimes not recognize unsupported color.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 0.24.0</h3>\n<p>Breaking changes</p>\n<p>Structural changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum Rust version is now <code>1.56</code> and may change in minor versions until\nfurther notice. It is now tracked in the library's <code>Cargo.toml</code>, instead, by\nthe standard <code>[package.rust-version]</code> field. Note: this applies <em>to the\nlibrary itself</em>. You may need different version resolutions for dependencies\nwhen using a non-stable version of Rust.</li>\n<li>The <code>math::utils::{nq, utils}</code> modules have been removed. These are better\nserved through the <code>color_quant</code> crate and the standard library respectively.</li>\n<li>All codecs are now available through <code>image::codecs</code>, no longer top-level.</li>\n<li><code>ExtendedColorType</code> and <code>DynamicImage</code> have been made <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code>,\nproviding more methods instead of exhaustive matching.</li>\n<li>Reading images through the generic <code>io::Reader</code>, as well as generic\nconvenience interfaces, now requires the underlying reader to be <code>BufRead + Seek</code>. This allows more efficient support more formats. Similarly, writing\nnow requires writers to be <code>Write + Seek</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>Bgra*</code> variants of buffers, which were only half-supported, have been\nremoved. The owning buffer types <code>ImageBuffer</code> and <code>DynamicImage</code>\nfundamentally already make a choice in supported pixel representations. This\nallows for more consistent internal behavior. Callers are expected to convert\nformats when using those buffers, which they are required to do in any case\nalready, and which is routinely performed by decoders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trait reworks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Pixel</code> trait is no longer implemented quite as liberally for structs</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[image](https://github.com/image-rs/image) from 0.23.10 to 0.23.12.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/blob/master/CHANGES.md\">image's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Version 0.23.12</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a soundness issue affecting the impls of <code>Pixel::from_slice_mut</code>. This\nwould previously reborrow the mutable input reference as a shared one but\nthen proceed to construct the mutable result reference from it. While UB\naccording to Rust's memory model, we're fairly certain that no miscompilation\ncan happen with the LLVM codegen in practice.\nSee 5cbe1e6767d11aff3f14c7ad69a06b04e8d583c7 for more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix <code>imageops::blur</code> panicking when <code>sigma = 0.0</code>. It now defaults to <code>1.0</code>\nas all negative values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix re-exporting <code>png::{CompressionType, FilterType}</code> to maintain SemVer\ncompatibility with the <code>0.23</code> releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>ImageFormat::from_extension</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add copyless DynamicImage to byte slice/vec conversion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add bit-depth specific <code>into_</code> and <code>to_</code> DynamicImage conversion methods.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 0.23.11</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>NeuQuant</code> implementation is now supplied by <code>color_quant</code>. Use of the\ntype defined by this library is discouraged.</li>\n<li>The <code>jpeg</code> decoder can now downscale images that are decoded by 1,2,4,8.</li>\n<li>Optimized the jpeg encoding ~5-15%.</li>\n<li>Deprecated the <code>clamp</code> function. Use <code>num-traits</code> instead.</li>\n<li>The ICO decoder now accepts an empty mask.</li>\n<li>Fixed an overflow in ICO mask decoding potentially leading to panic.</li>\n<li>Added <code>ImageOutputFormat</code> for <code>AVIF</code></li>\n<li>Updated <code>tiff</code> to <code>0.6</code> with lzw performance improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/07b0b85261d20e6517a3f4e7c103154e62c1cc3e\"><code>07b0b85</code></a> Update release notes and meta data for 0.23.12</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/b99a2a983f47e3faf32f6a88f59f352eb5b3e30f\"><code>b99a2a9</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1368\">#1368</a> from fintelia/bug-1365</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/28ac73e116b44841c3a6864b7f8b7d10971fd074\"><code>28ac73e</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1362\">#1362</a> from Mike-Neto/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/229a6874ef463b0ba24072b52ae65a0fa31a8e96\"><code>229a687</code></a> Fix bug 1365</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/cd4c57a7630ab1cdc215ef4731b6630a0efc8e09\"><code>cd4c57a</code></a> Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/983\">#983</a>. blur 0.0 panic</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/085300e5e1cc3570f93272a79aa2f4803ea49169\"><code>085300e</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1361\">#1361</a> from a1phyr/format_from_extension</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/b6507cf1d34abf772f5fe9d6e0310a34a83eeda8\"><code>b6507cf</code></a> Add examples</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/3843286b30eb9d355cb9f3df9c427b5fc7ad8ec4\"><code>3843286</code></a> Make ImageFormat::from_extension take an &amp;OsStr</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/fa37687ee0077fe4dadfa31b785be507be027424\"><code>fa37687</code></a> Add <code>ImageFormat::from_extension</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/commit/e0261ce3b8b612650b2a24b8da22fc5410d23fa1\"><code>e0261ce</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/image-rs/image/issues/1358\">#1358</a> from HeroicKatora/fix-mutability-provenance-of-pixels</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/image-rs/image/compare/v0.23.10...v0.23.12\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=image&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.23.10&new-version=0.23.12)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
