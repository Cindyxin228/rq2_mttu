Added a regression test.</li>\n<li>Fixed a panic when transforming webp images. Added a regression test.</li>\n<li>Added a check to prevent integer overflow when calculating file size for BMP\nimages. The missing check could panic in debug mode or else set an incorrect\nfile size in release mode.</li>\n<li>Upgraded the PNG image encoder to use the newer <code>PngEncoder::write_image</code>\ninstead of the deprecated <code>PngEncoder::encode</code> which did not account for byte\norder and could result in images with incorrect colors.</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>InsufficientMemory</code> error when trying to decode a PNG image.</li>\n<li>Fix warnings and CI issues.</li>\n<li>Typos and links in the documentation have been corrected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added check for dynamic image dimensions before resizing.
