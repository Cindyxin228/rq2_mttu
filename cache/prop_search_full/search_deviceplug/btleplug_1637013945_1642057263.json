source. So I'm about as in over my head as it gets. But I had a test environment for this bug and a desire to fix it, so here we are. I figured even if this doesn't end up being a good patch, it's a good test. I've tested this against [this gist](https://gist.github.com/subtle-supernova/495e9f0931b132751f85d2c109486fed) which scan for sennheiser devices and therefor pickup my headphones. My test returned a device id `00:00:00:00:00:00` with the connected bool as `false`, but I'm unsure if that's related to any of the changes I've made here.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can do, and thank you for the library.
