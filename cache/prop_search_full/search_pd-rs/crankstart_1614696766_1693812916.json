great if I could avoid pulling dependencies I don't need.\r\n\r\nI suggest making it optional, so crates that want it  (i.e. the `crankstart` crate) can have it, and other consumers can

APIs for generating sound aren't included, but I think that can be a separate issue.\r\n\r\n~I have this working prototype for an audio interface and I was hoping for feedback before I go further.  I'm not experienced with Rust/C interfaces, so there could be mistakes there.  Does this fit crankstart?  Would it expand to the rest of the sound API OK?~  Ready for review!\r\n\r\nI mainly patterned this after the graphics module, with some tweaks.  I attempted to follow crankstart and Playdate standards, veering away only where it seemed clear.  The most important change is probably the sound modules/subsystems - the Playdate audio APIs are the largest set of APIs, so I wanted a design that could split out the main subsystems.  `sound` is the top-level, and `sampleplayer` is the specific subsystem I implemented here, for sound effects.\r\n\r\nA few specific decisions worth consideration:\r\n* Storing the subsystem pointer (e.g. `*const crankstart_sys::playdate_sound_sampleplayer`) in `Sound` as well as the specific structs `SamplePlayer` and `AudioSample` for convenience.\r\n* Handling errors that I can't really test and aren't documented, e.g. when `play` returns non-1.\r\n* ~The use of `&mut` on the `AudioSample` argument to `set_sample` - I think I originally did this because of the use of `*mut` for arguments all over the place in the bindings, but in the user-facing API, I don't think it matters..?  I should probably make it `&`.~  Made `&` with internal `Rc`; see comments below.\r\n\r\n~If this design is basically OK, I'd want to implement `fileplayer` as well before merging, to make sure the modular approach works cleanly, and because `fileplayer` is for music, probably the next most important subsystem after sound effects.  (I don't think I'll need to generate sounds on-device, so most of the remaining APIs aren't as urgent for me.)~  Added.\r\n\r\nI tested all of the functions in the simulator, and confirmed playback worked on device.  Docstrings detail any non-obvious behavior I found.\r\n\r\n~The only calls I found confusing were `get_offset`/`set_offset`, which were clearly getting through to the Playdate APIs OK (it did offset, and wouldn't go beyond my sample length) but weren't being set exactly to the values I passed through, even with rate 1.0.  I suspect my WAV files may be odd; I'm not very experienced with sound files or APIs.~  I misunderstood the purpose of offset and clarified the docstring.", "reactions": {"url":
