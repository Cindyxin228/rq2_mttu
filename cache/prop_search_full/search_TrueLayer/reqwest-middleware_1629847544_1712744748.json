thanks for creating and maintaining this crate. I recently used it to implement some middleware for auto-refreshing OAuth access tokens - as part of the process I factored out [`reqwest-chain`](https://github.com/tommilligan/reqwest-chain) as a reusable abstraction.\r\n\r\nI think this fills a niche where simply retrying with the same request (`reqwest-retry`) is not sufficient - you want to update the request based on the response you got. It's a pretty thin layer on top of `request-middleware`, but I found the abstraction helpful in constraining my eventual solution.\r\n\r\nThere is a minimal example in the [README](https://github.com/tommilligan/reqwest-chain#getting-started) if your're interested, otherwise I'd appreciate a link in your README for visibility!", "reactions": {"url":
