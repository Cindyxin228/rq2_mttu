It does so by breaking down the code gen for select into three components, one small snippet for how each row is handled depending on `content`, one small snippet for how the iterator over rows is handled depending on `container`, and one shared snippet that puts it all together.\r\n\r\nThe code it generates isn't identical to the original code, but I believe it's logically equivalent. Except for\r\n\r\n - The two cases mentioned above that weren't handled correctly before\r\n - Properly classifying u8 as a primitive type (it was missing from the list).\r\n - Collecting the rows iterator directly into the `Vec<OutputType>` instead of first allocating an intermediate `Vec` with `Results` un-flattened.\r\n\r\nI uncommented some existing tests that checked these for correctness, as well as adding two additional tests for `Option<CustomStruct>` and `Vec<CustomStruct>` to complete the grid of possibilities (those tests pass before the changes as well).\r\n\r\nI believe this bumps MSRV to 1.70, and it probably requires a CI change as a result, but before figuring that out I wanted to make sure you were ok with bumping the MSRV. I'm using it for `Option::is_some_and` (that I know about, I'm generally not very careful about not using new features so it wouldn't surprise me to find out I was using something else that bumped MSRV as well). If you're worried about that I can easily rewrite it to use older and only slightly clunkier syntax.\r\n\r\nThanks for a cool library :)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trevyn/turbosql/issues/33/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trevyn/turbosql/issues/33/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
