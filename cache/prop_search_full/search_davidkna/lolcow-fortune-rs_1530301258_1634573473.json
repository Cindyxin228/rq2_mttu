It contains a number of bugfixes and\nnew features, some of them may theoretically be considered breaking. We did our best\nto avoid any problems on user's side but, if it wasn't good enough, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues\">file an issue ASAP</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>structopt</code> used to treat <code>::path::to::type::Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> as <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>\nspecial type. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/pull/287\">This was considered erroneous</a>.\n(same for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>bool</code>). Now only exact <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> match is a special type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>#[structopt(version = expr)]</code> where <code>expr</code> is not a string literal used to get\noverridden by auto generated <code>.version()</code> call,\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/283\">incorrectly</a>. Now it doesn't.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed bug with top-level <code>App::*</code> calls on multiple <code>struct</code>s, see\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/265\">#289</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Positional <code>bool</code> args with no explicit <code>#[structopt(parse(...))]</code> annotation are\nnow prohibited. This couldn't work well anyway, see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/blob/master/examples/true_or_false.rs\">this example</a>\nfor details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now we've instituted strict priority between doc comments, about, help, and the like.\nSee <a href=\"https://docs.rs/structopt/0.3/structopt/#help-messages\">the documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>HUGE THANKS to <a href=\"https://github.com/ssokolow\"><code>@ssokolow</code></a></strong> for tidying up our documentation,\nteaching me English and explaining why our doc used to suck. I promise I'll make the rest\nof the doc up to your standards... sometime later!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Implement <code>StructOpt</code> for <code>Box&lt;impl StructOpt&gt;</code> so from now on you can use <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>\nwith <code>flatten</code> and <code>subcommand</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/304\">#304</a>).</p>\n<pre lang=\"rust\"><code>enum Command {\n    #[structopt(name = &quot;version&quot;)]\n    PrintVersion,\n<pre><code>#[structopt(name = &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;)]\nDoSomething {\n    #[structopt(flatten)]\n    config: Box&amp;lt;DoSomethingConfig&amp;gt;,\n},\n\n#[structopt(name = &amp;quot;first&amp;quot;)]\nDoSomethingElse {\n</code></pre>\n<p></code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...
