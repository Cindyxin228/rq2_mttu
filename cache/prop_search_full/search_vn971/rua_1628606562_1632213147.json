This allows support for additional architectures like `aarch64` or `arm` (see #126).\r\n\r\n#### How does it work?\r\n* A specific `seccomp.bpf` is generated via `build.rs` during compilation.\r\n  * The generated `seccomp.bpf` matches the `target_arch` of the `rua` binary. It's no longer required to distinguish different versions during runtime.\r\n  * The `seccomp.bpf` is embedded to the binary, just like the prebuilt ones before. During runtime it is extracted to `.system/seccomp.bpf`. (The prebuilt files are removed by this pull request.)\r\n* A new *build-time* dependency `libscmp` is introduced to generate the `seccomp.bpf` file.\r\n  * There are various crates available for that purpose but to me `libscmp` seems most appealing. It has a very low footprint and provides all required features (especially `seccomp_syscall_resolve_name` and `seccomp_export_bpf`). An alternative would be the `libseccomp` crate.\r\n \r\n#### How can it be tested / reviewed?\r\n* The implementation exports next to the `seccomp.bpf` a `seccomp.pfc` to `OUT_DIR` containing the human-readable output of the filter. (This second file is not embedded to the binary but can easily be inspected.)\r\n* The `md5sum` for the `seccomp.bpf` file generated by this implementation is identical to the old one generated by [seccomp](https://github.com/kurnevsky/dotfiles/blob/master/.seccomp/) (https://github.com/kurnevsky/dotfiles/commit/1432bf8ae2b62f16142b7c87ad2e0fd28d27e9fc).\r\n```sh\r\n$ find . -name \\*.bpf -exec md5sum {} \\;\r\nde85db9cf299f131c51cecee5f84ce77  ./res/seccomp-i686.bpf\r\nf9cd17bc2fe18abc4f672071dd9e0c9c  ./res/seccomp-x86_64.bpf\r\nde85db9cf299f131c51cecee5f84ce77  ./target/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/build/rua-5b88deb180f14f08/out/seccomp.bpf\r\nf9cd17bc2fe18abc4f672071dd9e0c9c  ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/build/rua-bdd5a199bf2717e3/out/seccomp.bpf\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Remarks\r\n* The `seccomp.bpf` file can contain the ruleset for all supported architecures at once. This comes with an increased file size but may reduce the logic in `build.rs` by a few lines. (I don't think it's worth it.)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. In case another solution fits better, I'm happy to revise.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vn971/rua/issues/167/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vn971/rua/issues/167/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
