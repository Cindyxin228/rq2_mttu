This saves a _lot_ of time, especially when we are working on capability providers individually. The release action (`provider-release.yml`) will build, test, and release the provider to `crates.io` and a parJEEzy to our wasmcloud azure registry for distribution. This action is kicked off by pushing a tag to the main branch with the form of `provider-vX.Y.Z`, for example `redisgraph-v0.9.2`.
