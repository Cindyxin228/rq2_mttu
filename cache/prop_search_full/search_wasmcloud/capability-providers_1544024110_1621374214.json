automatically see the latest published crate version.

Curious if there are suggested improvements.\r\n\r\nI've also trawled through our READMEs and removed some lingering `wascc` references, added crates.io badges, and standardized the format of the READMEs.

Each individual build action (the `provider.yml`s) build and test the provider when a file has been modified in that specific provider. This saves a _lot_ of time, especially when we are working on capability providers individually. The release action (`provider-release.yml`) will build, test, and release the provider to `crates.io` and a parJEEzy to our wasmcloud azure registry for distribution. This action is kicked off by pushing a tag to the main branch with the form of `provider-vX.Y.Z`, for example `redisgraph-v0.9.2`.
