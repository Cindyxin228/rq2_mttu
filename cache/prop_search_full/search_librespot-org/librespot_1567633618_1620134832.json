Enhancements:\r\n\r\n - Store and handle samples as 32-bit floats instead of 16-bit integers. This provides 24-25 bits of transparency, allowing for 48-54 dB of headroom to do volume control and normalisation without throwing away bits or dropping dynamic range below 96 dB CD quality.\r\n\r\n - Perform volume control and normalisation in 64-bit arithmetic for minimum quantisation noise.\r\n \r\n - Output to 32-bit float, 32-bit integer, 24-bit integer (both in padded 32-bit words and as three-byte arrays) or 16-bit integer (default), as specified on the command line.\r\n\r\n - Add a dynamic limiter with configurable threshold, attack time, release or decay time, and steepness for the sigmoid transfer function. This mimics the native Spotify limiter, offering greater dynamic range than the old limiter, that just reduced overall gain to prevent clipping.\r\n\r\n - Make the configurable threshold also apply to the old limiter, which is still available.\r\n\r\n - DRY-ups of a lot of audio backend code, at the same time enabling `OggData` passthrough on the subprocess backend.\r\n\r\nResolves: #608\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n\r\n - New command line options: \r\n```\r\n        --format FORMAT Output format (F32, S32, S24, S24_3 or S16). Defaults to S16\r\n        --normalisation-method NORMALISATION_METHOD\r\n                        Specify the normalisation method to use - [basic,\r\n                        dynamic]. Default is dynamic.\r\n        --normalisation-threshold THRESHOLD\r\n                        Threshold (dBFS) to prevent clipping. Default is -1.0.\r\n        --normalisation-attack ATTACK\r\n                        Attack time (ms) in which the dynamic limiter is\r\n                        reducing gain. Default is 5.\r\n        --normalisation-release RELEASE\r\n                        Release or decay time (ms) in which the dynamic\r\n                        limiter is restoring gain. Default is 100.\r\n        --normalisation-knee KNEE\r\n                        Knee steepness of the dynamic limiter. Default is 1.0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n - For the dynamic limiter, steepness between 0.5 and 2.0 work well. The default of 1.0 yields a linear function; > 1.0 rolls off softly, is steeper midway and < 1.0 has a sharp initial response, then gentler midway. Feedback on optimisation of these parameters is welcome.\r\n\r\n - Compiling `with-vorbis` works, but panics. This was already the case and is not new to this PR.

When I familiarize myself with a codebase I often go through and clean up little things. I cleaned up:\r\n\r\n- the imports (merged & formatted)\r\n- removed stuff from edition 2015 that's no longer needed (extern crate)\r\n- removed last instance of error_chain\r\n- applied lots of clippy lints\r\n- `StreamLoaderController` in audio had methods which didn't need to be `&mut self` anymore\r\n\r\nThere should be no _real_ code changes here, it's all just cleanups.\r\n\r\nThere's more I'd like to do but this is already big enough for a PR. I'd like to start removing the `unwrap` and `expect`s in the code. The common practice these days is to use a boxed error type for binary, and `Error` derive (like `thiserror`) on library code. Given that, I think we should consider `anyhow` for the binary, we can replace `unwrap`/`expect` with `.context` and use `?`.\r\n\r\nNow that the code is written in async/await format, there looks to be a lot more we could potentially simplify.

(Nevertheless, dev and this branch are further diverging, merging will get harder. I hope there aren't too many other PRs in preparation.)\r\n\r\nHere are a few things worth noting:\r\n* Reverted #548 to make merging easier. After merging I reimplemented the functionality, but a little easier and with less code duplication.\r\n* I hope you're fine with using tokio's channels instead of futures' channels. I had the impression that the tokio channels were created with some of the drawbacks of futures' channels in mind.\r\n* Move the get_credentials function as I suggested in #596.\r\n* Remove `LinearMap` dependency and simply use `HashMap`. It wasn't clear why it was used at all, but it could be reverted if you know the reason.\r\n* Update the url dependency (#368)\r\n* Remove default impl for `SessionConfig` (it wasn't used, but needed the uuid dependency for librespot-core)\r\n* #566 used the slightly outdated `error-chain`, I replaced it by `thiserror`.\r\n\r\nPS: [Compare changes except merging](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/compare/678d177...Johannesd3:tokio-migration-refactor-deps)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/649/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/649/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/647/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647", "id": 814243633, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc4MjYzODM3", "number": 647, "title": "Set MSRV to 1.41", "user": {"login": "Johannesd3", "id": 51954457, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTU0NDU3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51954457?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3", "html_url": "https://github.com/Johannesd3", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Johannesd3/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-02-23T08:39:55Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-23T18:50:36Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-23T18:05:10Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/pulls/647", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647", "diff_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/647.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-23T18:05:10Z"}, "body": "Attempts to restore the MSRV to 1.41 which is the rustc version in stable Debian.

fixes two bugs in the playback crate (well, I also introduced them). \r\n\r\nSecondly, `RodioSink` was modified such that it implements `Send` now. The solution spawns an own thread to create the `rodio::OutputStream`. When `RodioSink` is dropped, this thread is notified via a channel and the `OutputStream` is dropped as well. So `RodioSink` doesn't carry the `OutputStream` anymore and is now `Send`. \r\n\r\nI also used this occasion to improve the error handling in the `RodioSink` using `thiserror`, but this should only be the beginning.\r\n\r\nIf it's ok, I will continue with those relatively small PRs for the tokio migration, so it's easier to follow what I'm doing and easier to contribute.", "reactions": {"url":

Its logic was moved to `Cache`, as well as the functions to store `Credential`s to disk. It recently became possible to split audio and system cache (#506), so this PR makes the paths in `struct Cache` optional. Also, error handling and logging was improved. It contains some breaking changes.\r\n\r\nHere are some random thoughts and questions about the cache I had while writing this PR. Some of this is stuff for future PRs.\r\n* The `Cache` feels now very \"threefold\". The struct could neatly be divided into three independent structs. It's basically twice the same code for volume and credentials, and even the code for audio files is similar. Is there any abstraction possible to avoid repetition? \r\n* Why are audio cache and \"system cache\" in a single struct anyway? The audio cache is only needed in the audio crate, and the system cache is mainly used in the connect crate and the application. \r\n* Would it be possible to use file-system-level copy to store audio files in cache? As far as I understand, the audio files are temporarily stored on disk.\r\n* The cache should use async file system operations (but this could happen in the tokio migration where it is much more convenient)\r\n* With #518, the audio cache is flushed whenever an error occurs.

@willstott101 for updating rodio to 0.13 and making this possible!\r\n\r\nThis works as is with jack at any sample rate (and solves #316, and  #343 ?)\r\n\r\nThe choice to put this in a separate feature called `rodiojack-backend` is deliberate. I tried to simply add the jack cpal devices to the alsa ones all together in `rodio-backend` yet as alsa and jack are exclusive, this always prints an error (either jack or alsa) to the terminal when checking on available devices. This can be tested [here](https://github.com/Lcchy/librespot/commit/659ea26ae0fdd0c61b3c2648f9704b4279e72774).\r\n\r\nps: You have to build without using the `--no-default-features`, please let me know if you see how to fix this (it seems to deactivate rodio for rodiojack)\r\nFYI: I still think that having all rodio devices in one backend is better, I will try to see in the next few days if I

This addresses the licensing issue mentioned in issue #539 with respect to this dependency.\r\n - Rewrites the PulseAudio backend code to use the higher-level `libpulse-binding` and `libpulse-simple-binding` crates (v2.13+), rather than the raw 'sys' layer crates, resulting in significant simplification.\r\n\r\nYou may want to consider bumping the dependency of the sys layer to v1.12+ (via v2.15+ of the bindings) which implemented use of `pkg-config`.\r\n\r\nOne detail of the last commit that's slightly uglier than I'd like is how the `Option<String>` device name attribute is used for the `Option<&str>` param.

Introduce a decent period size relative to the desired buffer. This reduces the load on the CPU because it increases the wakeup interval.\r\n  2. Only write to the pcm when a full period of data is available. This again increased performance quite considerably, though the effect probably relies a lot more on the specific pcm. I also changed the struct to a regular one since I had to introduce values for the buffer. I wasn't a big fan of the tuple struct anyway since there is no intuitive association of a datum for AlsaSink with index 0 and 1 and adding 2 and 3 would not make that any better.\r\n\r\n~NOTE: I did not look for a suitable buffer type before implementing the buffer/buffered_data combination. If anyone is aware of a suitable solution I will gladly make the change if that is preferable.~ Now replaced with a vector to match the actual period size.

When I wrote this code, I tested it quite a bit with the desktop client (Linux) and the Android app. The behaviour for kPlayStatusLoading was that the desktop client would grey out the progress bar and the Android app just ignored it.\r\nMy understanding of kPlayStatusLoading was that it should be sent while loading a track but not yet playing it, so that's what I programmed.\r\n\r\nWith the new behaviour of the app, it seems like my interpretation of kPlayStatusLoading was wrong because the way the app behaves is indeed annoying and doesn't make sense when loading a track. Maybe it is intended to be sent during the start-up phase of a user-controlled client. I don't know.\r\n\r\nIn any case, librespot should probably refrain from using kPlayStatusLoading for now.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behaviour such that instead of kPlayStatusLoading a kPlayStatusPlay or kPlayStatusPaused is sent. When the track is actually loaded, the status is sent again (as before) so the timing is corrected.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour is that when you start to play a track, the progress bar in the client starts moving even though librespot is still loading. Once the track is loaded the bar jumps back to the correct position.\r\n\r\nNot 100% clean but this was the behaviour of the app before Spotify changed it.

https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/issues/28\r\n\r\nThanks to the gapless playback enhancements, this is working much better than it did in December. I also recently got rid of all my warnings and did a rustfmt. \r\n\r\nOne current bug is that the apparent playback position in the Spotify GUI is very slightly (about 1 second) ahead of the actual position of the song as you're hearing it out of your headphones. It's much, _much_ better with the gapless fixes from kaymes, but still slightly behind. This is because the appsrc has a 4k buffer, and some of the other pipeline elements (audio sinks, for example) also have buffers. Without a little bit of pipeline buffering it would be very choppy.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't think this backend works particularly well with the assumptions of \"gapless mode disabled.\" It works fine for gapless-enabled though.\r\n\r\nI also need to document this backend on the wiki under Audio_Backends, but I don't want to add docs for something that won't be merged, so I'll add that afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing for newbies to understand will be how to write a correct `device` argument for gstreamer. This is only necessary if the user wants something other than the audio going directly to the `autoaudiosink` (a gstreamer-determined \"sane default\" for audio playback based on the user's system), but there are quite some valid use cases for wanting something different (network streaming over rtp or something to a \"smart speaker,\" for instance.)\r\n\r\nI'm still sort of a rust newbie, so I will work on improving my branch if this isn't up to snuff yet.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/456/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/456/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/452", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/452/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/452/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/452/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/452", "id": 579905716, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg3MjE1NzEw", "number": 452, "title": "Add more data to player events and fire more of them", "user": {"login": "kaymes", "id": 3346993, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDY5OTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3346993?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes", "html_url": "https://github.com/kaymes", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2020-03-12T12:30:01Z", "updated_at": "2020-05-11T06:57:19Z", "closed_at": "2020-05-11T06:57:18Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/pulls/452", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/452", "diff_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/452.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/452.patch", "merged_at": "2020-05-11T06:57:18Z"}, "body": "This PR adds more metadata to the PlayerEvents. I also added some comments that explain which PlayerEvent is fired when.\r\n\r\nMore PlayerEvents are now exposed through the --onevent script and the additional meta data is made available through additional environment variables.\r\n\r\nCurrently the additional metadata that is being exported is the title of the current track and its length.\r\nIt would be nice to add the Artist and maybe the cover art URL as well but this requires loading of additional information from the server. At this stage I'm only making available what's already there. So that's half of #439. \r\n(Loading the Artist info shouldn't be too difficult, but there doesn't seem to be an interface for the cover art yet - at least I couldn't find it in the code or protobuf definition).\r\n\r\nWhile doing so I realised that a growing set of metadata variables is getting passed around within the player. Thus I decided to refactor this and bundle them into a TrackMetaData struct. This should make it much easier to add more fields in the future.\r\n\r\nThe events that trigger the --onevent script are:\r\nstart\r\nchange\r\nstop\r\nplaying\r\npaused\r\nvolume_set\r\n\r\nThe first three events are as before and the last three are new. \r\n\r\nOnly playing and paused provide the additional meta data. The reason is that start and change are fired before the track has been loaded, so the data isn't available.\r\n\r\nThe volume_set event solves one half of #410.

I'm putting it up for discussion as an alternative approach.\r\n\r\nIt addresses the issue mentioned in #406.\r\n\r\nIf activated, librespot emits events before the sink is opened and after it is closed. The events are blocking in the sense that the player waits for the handler to complete. This allows to write a handler that frees the sink before librespot attempts to open it.\r\n\r\nFrom an API side, this is implemented as a callback. If a callback is registered, the player executes it blockingly.\r\nFrom a binary side if --emit-sink-events is set, the usual --onevent script is used and librespot waits for the script's completion.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, the events after closing are blocking, too. To make them non-blocking would require some more special handling to avoid race conditions if the sink is closed and opened in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nThe callback (and env variables) of the script convey three states: \"running\", \"closed\", \"temporarily_closed\". The latter is being used if the sink is temporarily closed between tracks while loading the next one.

As far as I can see it's working well, but given the extent of the changes, it requires a good amount of testing.\r\n\r\n**Features of this PR so far:**\r\n- Upgrade of plumbing between spirc and player.\r\n- Gapless playback: pre-loading and keeping the sink open.\r\n- Improve notifications to Spotify: while loading a track, the status kPlayStatusLoading is sent and while playing, the correct playback position is transmitted (after loading, seek and buffer under runs).\r\n- More and more detailed player events are produced.\r\n\r\nThe reason for having \"additional features\" in this one PR is that the necessary changes to the plumbing between the player and spirc made them come out naturally.\r\n\r\n**And now to the more technical details:**\r\nOne of the first realisations was, that for gapless play there has to be better comunication between the player and spirc. Initially I thought about beefing up the future that notifies spirc about the end of a track, but then I realised, that this would kind of duplicate the player events channel that is already there. Thus, I decided to beef up the player events channel instead and get rid of the existing future. The player can now feed multiple player event channels and spirc takes one of them to listen to player events. This allows spirc to know about when to preload the next track. As a by product, it also allows spirc to have more detailed information about the player's status, in particular the current playback position.\r\n\r\nTo be able to preload tracks, loading of tracks has to happen in a non-blocking way. Initially I started to convert PlayerInternal::load_track() into a proper future. However, I eventually realised, that the call to seek() is blocking and can't be converted to proper async code easily. Thus load_track() now spawns a new (short lived) thread to load a track and put the result onto a one-shot channel. Thus, we effectively get a future that loads the next track.\r\n\r\nI turned PlayerInternal into a future so run() is now replaced by poll(). But it still contains blocking code as before. Thus, it must not be spawned onto the tokio reactor but instead run via wait() in a dedicated thread. That's the same as before, the thread just does player.wait() instead of player.run(). The reason for this is to give PlayerInternal's main loop a context to poll multiple channels and futures as needed without having to resort to timed cycles and similar crutches.\r\n\r\nThe code is set up such that the player emits a TimeToPreloadNextTrack event when playback is 30 seconds or less to the end of the track AND the remainder of the track has been downloaded. This is the signal to SpircTask to examine the playlist (using preview_next_track()) and call player.preload_track() to have the player start with the download.\r\n\r\nIn the old code, spirc uses the protobuf frame it communicates with the server with to store its own state machine (e.g. store the playing status). This was no longer sufficient. E.g. when the status is kPlayStatusLoading, spirc must know whether it is loading to play or loading to pause. Thus, I gave SpircTask its own state (SpircPlayStatus) which allows it to accurately track what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Next steps:**\r\nThe added events also allow to expose more information to external programs through run_program_on_events. E.g. volume changes now emit events on the channel which would make fixing #410 trivial. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/430/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/430/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/427", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/427/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/427/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/issues/427/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/427", "id": 554022775, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzY2MjUwNzU4", "number": 427, "title": "Gracefully handle lost network connections", "user": {"login": "kaymes", "id": 3346993, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDY5OTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3346993?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes", "html_url": "https://github.com/kaymes", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kaymes/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2020-01-23T08:58:36Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-30T01:04:38Z", "closed_at": "2020-01-30T01:04:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/librespot-org/librespot/pulls/427", "html_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/427", "diff_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/427.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/427.patch", "merged_at": "2020-01-30T01:04:38Z"}, "body": "Currently librespot tends to panic as soon as something goes wrong with the server connection. Lost server connections can have a variety of causes such as network issues or a spotify server becoming unavailable. Librespot should recover from lost server connections gracefully and reconnect and/or wait for a new connection from a client. \r\n\r\nHere I made a series of changes that convert panics into proper error handling in case of lost connections.\r\n\r\n* A lost network connection no longer causes a panic. Instead errors and channel closures are propagated through the system.\r\n* When the session shuts down, the mercury and channel components are shut down as well and all channels of pending requests are dropped. This notifies pending requests and allows them to handle the situation. This is a necessary to avoid deadlocks. (e.g. the player thread might not join otherwise).\r\n* Spontaneous shutdown of sqirc in main no longer causes a panic. Instead libreelec interprets it as a connection lost situation and attempts to re-connect with the same credentials. I added a limiter such that no further re-connection attempt is made if 5 re-connects happened within the last 10 minutes. In this case it just waits for another client to connect.

potentially fire of lots of small requests to keep the amount of pending bytes at the desired level. If bandwidth limits are hit, this leads to responses being interleaved - all requests are served simultaneously, which means the total data rate is great but each single request experiences a low data rate. A consequence can be, that the first request isn't responded to in time and we get a buffer under-run.\r\n\r\nI solved this by limiting the amount of open requests when pre-fetching: a pre-fetch request is only sent when less than 4 requests are open. This leads to less requests which are larger. Thus, individual requests should still get decent download rates.\r\n\r\nI experimented with different values. Using a limit of 3 leads to significantly lower overall download rates. Thus, I chose 4.\r\n\r\nI also increased the amount of data that is requested ahead of the current read positions.\r\n\r\nSo far I haven't had any more buffer under-runs with these changes.

I analysed why librespot is slow when loading files and wrote up my findings in issue #306. Back then, I also started work on a new mechanism to download the files. Unfortunately, I got busy and forgot about it and never submitted it despite it being almost finished. Until today.\r\n\r\nHere is my work on a new downloading strategy for librespot.\r\n\r\nThe idea is, that it uses dynamic block sizes. That is, blocks are small while seeking and during initial play and grow for downloading the grunt of the file. Also, while seeking in a file, it only downloads the requested blocks whereas while streaming, it reads ahead until the entire file is downloaded and placed in the cache.\r\n\r\nI also implemented some heuristics based on the observed round-trip (ping) times to determine how much to buffer before playback.\r\n\r\nPlease test this version of the code.\r\n\r\nThe thing I'm most worried about is the possibility of not buffering enough because I can't exhaustively test this. This must be tested with different internet connections. If you notice the playback starting and then there's a short pause after which it resumes (a buffer under run), then the ping-time-buffer-heuristic must be adapted.", "reactions": {"url":

on my windows laptop, I'll try again later), but [browsing the code](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot-java/blob/0a08ba32eb8036f96a65f1cc57e1ea155da52ff1/core/src/main/java/xyz/gianlu/librespot/player/StateWrapper.java#L251) I couldn't see anything like this so I'm curious if the shuffle state does actually work better over there?
