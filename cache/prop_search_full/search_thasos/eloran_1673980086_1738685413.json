I believe the tests are correct, but I would encourage you to also double check.\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\n\r\nHey, I am the maintainer of Axum Test and saw you are using it. I had a look to see if I can update to the latest version for you, and if there is anything I can do to make your tests simpler / easier to write. I have a bunch of changes that utilise Axum Test here that should help.\r\n\r\n(Feel free to let me know if this PR is more annoying than helpful.)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/thasos/eloran/issues/11/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/thasos/eloran/issues/11/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
