Just using `lock_api::RawMutex` is not much longer, and it immediately makes it much more clear to the reader that the *local type* `RawMutex` implements the trait *from another crate*.

I think we can get away with them not being `unsafe` with some minor adjustments. Mostly this PR removes `unsafe` keywords from methods and adds `unsafe` blocks within them. But there is one more difference that I'm hoping should make this safe to call from the outside:\r\n```rust\r\nfn unlock(&self) {\r\n    let state = self.state.fetch_and(!LOCKED_BIT, Ordering::Release);\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSwitching from `fetch_sub` to `fetch_and` is intended to make the method not corrupt `self.state` if called on an already unlocked `WordLock`. Previously multiple calls would continue to decrement the integer by one, locking and unlocking it as well as corrupting the part of it that is used as a pointer. By using the bit and operation this should just zero out the `LOCKED_BIT` without touching the rest. The test suite passes, I'm not sure if I have missed something else that makes this a bad change.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like the trait on `usize` providing the convenience methods we can skip them. They are unrelated to making the methods safe, other than it might be harder to screw code up if the bit manipulation is extracted.", "reactions": {"url":
