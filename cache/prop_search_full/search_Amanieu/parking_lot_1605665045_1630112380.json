I used parking_lot::RawMutex as my \"control group\" to sanity-check my test suite, but it ended up detecting data races in WordLock.\r\n\r\nTaking a look, the Orderings seem a bit too loose \u2014 lock_slow used Release in the cmpxchg_weak but needs at least Acquire semantics to acquire the lock (although just using Acquire did not appease TSan), and unlock_slow had a similar problem but reversed (although that code more obviously needs at least Acquire, and so makes sense that it needs AcqRel).\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm *definitely* not sure these are actually minimal orderings, but I wasn't able to reduce any individual ordering further without upsetting TSan. That said, there may also be a cleverer approach to this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is the code that detected the issue. I haven't minimized it, although its still pretty small. It uses `cobb` to perform the thread fuzzing, but `cobb` is all safe code (aside from a single function that isn't called in this test, and just does volatile reads/writes that are clearly sound)
