limiter) on WASM, which required `parking_lot` to use a wasm compatible `Instant` type, and I came up with this patch.\r\n\r\nThe underlying `instant::Instant` type is `std::time::Instant` when compiled without enabling the `\"stdweb\"` or `\"wasm-bindgen\"` features.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to take it I'll be happy; I'm still trying out different rate-limiting implementations, so am not sure if I'll be using this (but if it's merged, then it's more likely that I will).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Amanieu/parking_lot/issues/231/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":
