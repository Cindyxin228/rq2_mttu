folks,\r\n\r\nI believe this adds support for long mDNS names, as reported in issue https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1232 \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of additional changes that I made in order to test the scenario where long mDNS names are encountered, so I'd love to get feedback about unintended consequences: \r\n\r\n* ~~I added the `std` feature for `ring` in the top-level `Cargo.toml`. I wasn't able to build or test within the mdns directory without it (eg: `cd misc/mdns; cargo test` would fail on `ring` error traits).~~\r\n* I added support for creating `PeerId` from the `Identity` multihash. It's in line with the spec, but I'm not familiar with the nuances. This was done so that I could generate long mDNS names for tests.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1287/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Let me know if this bothers you. I might be able to change it with temporary files in the build scripts.\r\n\r\n- I think in the long run we should regenerate the files in our CI on each run to ensure the generated files stay in sync with the `.proto` files.

"merged_at": "2019-09-23T10:04:40Z"}, "body": "This is a proposal for making the multistream-select protocol (version) configurable both on transport upgrades as well as for individual substreams. It adds a new \"lazy\" version of multistream-select 1.0 that is identical on the wire but delays sending of negotiation protocol frames as much as possible, which is only safe to use under additional assumptions that go beyond what is required by the multistream-select v1 specification (see the inline doc-comment on `Version::V1Lazy` and the discussion in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1212).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of motivations behind this:\r\n\r\n  1. It will arguably be necessary eventually to be able to specify the multistream-select protocol version to use, at least as a dialer, to ever support 0-RTT negotiation in the presence of multiple protocol versions to choose from.\r\n\r\n  2. By defaulting to the standard `V1` version, the optimisations provided by lazy negotiation are still provided as an opt-in per transport and per substream protocol, without losing full compatibility by default (i.e. addressing https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1241 in a different way than https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1244). It may thus offer an opt-in fast-path for specific projects or protocols, especially ones that want to make heavy use of the substream-per-request pattern, such as in https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/3520.\r\n\r\n  3. The differences between the versions is constrained to the `multistream-select` library, not requiring outside workarounds for completely safe `V1` compatibility like there is currently in `libp2p-core` with the additional [`AwaitNegotiated`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/core/src/upgrade/apply.rs#L158-L162) step for dialer upgrades. I.e. the distinction between fully conformant / interoperable `V1` and the `V1Lazy` variant are fully inside `multistream-select`, with the choice exposed through the choice of `Version` for the dialer (the listener can always safely support all protocol versions, which also provides a general upgrade path from older to newer versions).\r\n\r\nAn example for configuring transport upgrades to use lazy negotiation:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n            let transport = libp2p_tcp::TcpConfig::new()\r\n                .upgrade(upgrade::Version::V1Lazy)\r\n                .authenticate(libp2p_secio::SecioConfig::new(local_key))\r\n                .multiplex(libp2p_mplex::MplexConfig::new())\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example for configuring outbound substreams on a handler to use lazy negotiation:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet proto = SubstreamProtocol::new(p).with_upgrade_protocol(upgrade::Version::V1Lazy);\r\nOneShotHandler::new(proto, self.config.inactivity_timeout)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only thing that would still be nice to have is to default the multistream protocol version used for substreams to the one used for the transport upgrades, but I didn't see an easy way to do that kind of propagation at the moment.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1245/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1245/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1243", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1243/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1243/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1243/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1243", "id": 491294795, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzE1NjkwNTI2", "number": 1243, "title": "[multistream-select] Fix Display impl for NegotiationError.", "user": {"login": "romanb", "id": 177309, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzMwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177309?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb", "html_url": "https://github.com/romanb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-09-09T19:56:23Z", "updated_at": "2019-09-10T08:16:19Z", "closed_at": "2019-09-10T08:16:16Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1243", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1243", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1243.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1243.patch", "merged_at": "2019-09-10T08:16:16Z"}, "body": "The current `Display` impl for `NegotiationError` is pointless, since it uses `Error::description` which is both deprecated and not overridden for `NegotiationError`, thus the the `Display` impl produces  the unhelpful message: \"description() is deprecated; use Display\".

Rather, transport upgrades are somewhat laborious and involve non-trivial code duplication.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a `transport::upgrade::Builder` that is obtained from `Transport::upgrade`. The `Builder` encodes the previously implicit rules for transport upgrades:\r\n\r\n  1. Authentication upgrades must happen first.\r\n  2. Any number of upgrades may follow.\r\n  3. A multiplexer upgrade must happen last.\r\n\r\nSince multiplexing is the last (regular) transport upgrade (because that upgrade yields a `StreamMuxer` which is no longer a `AsyncRead` / `AsyncWrite` resource, which the upgrade process is based on),\r\nthe upgrade starts with `Transport::upgrade` and ends with `Builder::multiplex`, which drops back down to the `Transport`, providing a fluent API.\r\n\r\n## Contract for authenticators and multiplexers\r\n\r\nAuthentication and multiplexer upgrades must adhere to a minimal contract w.r.t their outputs:\r\n\r\n  1. An authentication upgrade is given an (async) I/O resource `C` and must produce a pair `(I, D)` where `I: ConnectionInfo` and  `D` is a new (async) I/O resource `D`.\r\n\r\n  2. A multiplexer upgrade is given an (async) I/O resource `C` and must produce a `M: StreamMuxer`.\r\n\r\n  To that end, two changes to the `secio` and `noise` protocols have been made:\r\n    \r\n  1. The `secio` upgrade now outputs a pair of `(PeerId, SecioOutput)`. The former implements `ConnectionInfo` and the latter `AsyncRead` /  `AsyncWrite`, fulfilling the `Builder` contract.\r\n    \r\n  2. A new `NoiseAuthenticated` upgrade has been added that wraps around any noise upgrade (i.e. `NoiseConfig`) and has an output of  `(PeerId, NoiseOutput)`, i.e. it checks if the `RemoteIdentity` from the handshake output is an `IdentityKey`, failing if that is not the case. This is the standard upgrade procedure one wants for integrating noise with libp2p-core/swarm.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nA typical example before/after:\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n   let transport = libp2p_tcp::TcpConfig::new()\r\n            .with_upgrade(libp2p_secio::SecioConfig::new(local_key))\r\n            .and_then(move |out, endpoint| {\r\n                let peer_id = out.remote_key.into_peer_id();\r\n                let peer_id2 = peer_id.clone();\r\n                let upgrade = libp2p_mplex::MplexConfig::default()\r\n                    .map_outbound(move |muxer| (peer_id, muxer))\r\n                    .map_inbound(move |muxer| (peer_id2, muxer));\r\n                upgrade::apply(out.stream, upgrade, endpoint)\r\n            });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n  let transport = libp2p_tcp::TcpConfig::new()\r\n            .upgrade()\r\n            .authenticate(libp2p_secio::SecioConfig::new(local_key))\r\n            .multiplex(libp2p_mplex::MplexConfig::new());\r\n```\r\n\r\nFore more examples, see the diff, which removes all of the related TODOs.\r\n\r\nSince `Transport::with_upgrade` is removed and `transport::upgrade::Upgrade` changed to fit into the `Builder` pipeline, these changes are not fully backward-compatible, but adapting existing code should be  easy.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1240/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1240/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1238", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1238/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1238/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1238/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1238", "id": 488511681, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzEzNTE2MTA2", "number": 1238, "title": "Remove libp2p-observed", "user": {"login": "tomaka", "id": 1412254, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTIyNTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412254?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka", "html_url": "https://github.com/tomaka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-09-03T10:05:37Z", "updated_at": "2019-09-03T12:28:20Z", "closed_at": "2019-09-03T12:28:08Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1238", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1238", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1238.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1238.patch", "merged_at": "2019-09-03T12:28:08Z"}, "body": "Similarly to libp2p-ratelimit, this isn't used by anyone and hasn't seen any usage.\r\n\r\nlibp2p-observed was originally a replacement for libp2p-identify that only transmits the observed address, while other protocols were supposed to be added for other informations.

occurred on incoming TCP connections. This PR makes the actual error accessible by returning it from the listener stream and subsequently putting it into a listener event.

The following are the main conceptual changes:\r\n\r\n  1. The multistream-select header is always sent together with the first negotiation message.\r\n\r\n  2. Enable 0-RTT: If the dialer only supports a single protocol, it can send protocol data (e.g. the actual application request) together with the multistream-select header and protocol proposal. Similarly, if the listener supports a proposed protocol, it can send protocol data (e.g. the actual application response) together with the multistream-select header and protocol confirmation.\r\n    \r\n  3. In general, the dialer \"settles on\" an expected protocol as soon as it runs out of alternatives. Furthermore, both dialer and listener do not immediately flush the final protocol confirmation, allowing it to be sent together with application protocol data. Attempts to read from an incompletely negotiated I/O stream implicitly flushes any pending data.\r\n    \r\n  4. A clean / graceful shutdown of an I/O stream always tries to complete protocol negotiation, so even if a request does not expect a response, as long as the I/O stream is shut down cleanly, an error will occur if the remote did not support the expected protocol after all.\r\n\r\n  5. If desired in specific cases, it is possible to explicitly wait for full completion of the negotiation before sending or receiving data by waiting on the future returned by `Negotiated::complete()`.\r\n\r\nOverall, the hope is that this especially improves the situation for the substream-per-request scenario.\r\n \r\nThe public API of multistream-select changed slightly, requiring both `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` bounds for async reading and writing due to the implicit buffering and \"lazy\" negotiation.

It's not great to depend on such a version, because they aren't compatible with any other.\r\n\r\nFor the `Future`, `Context` and `Poll` items it's not a problem, because the library re-exports these symbols from the Rust standard library. Therefore if a function returns a `Poll` coming from `futures-preview 0.3.0-alpha.17`, it is the same `Poll` as the one in `futures-preview 0.3.0-alpha.16` for example.\r\n\r\nFor `Sink`, `Stream`, `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`, this is more problematic, and I hope that a version 0.3.0 of `futures-preview` will be eventually released.\r\n\r\ncc #993 \r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Regular (value-)records are subject to re-replication and re-publication as per standard Kademlia. Provider records are only subject to re-publication.\r\n   * For standard Kademlia value lookups (quorum = 1), if found, the record is cached at the closest peer to the key that did not return the value, as per standard Kademlia.\r\n   * Expiration times of regular (value-)records are computed exponentially inversely proportional to the number of nodes between the local node and the closest node known to the key (beyond the k closest), as per standard Kademlia.\r\n    \r\nTo that end, the protobuf structure for regular (value-)records is extended with the two fields `ttl` and `publisher`, in order to implement the different semantics of re-replication (by any of the k closest peers to the key, not affecting expiry) and re-publication (by the original publisher, resetting the expiry). This is not done yet in other libp2p Kademlia implementations (see e.g. [libp2p-go-323]). The new protobuf fields have been given somewhat unique identifiers to prevent future collision, should the libp2p spec and protocol be extended.\r\n    \r\nSimilarly, periodic re-publication of provider records does not seem to be done yet in other implementations (see e.g. [libp2p-js-98]) but was already drafted in the existing Rust implementation, which I thus continued.\r\n    \r\n[libp2p-146]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/146\r\n[libp2p-1089]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1089\r\n[libp2p-go-323]: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/323\r\n[libp2p-js-98]: https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/98\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1189/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1189/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1188", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1188/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1188/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1188/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1188", "id": 461499979, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjkyNDExMDA4", "number": 1188, "title": "Move swarm and protocols handler into swarm crate.", "user": {"login": "twittner", "id": 132165, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE2NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132165?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner", "html_url": "https://github.com/twittner", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/twittner/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2019-06-27T12:28:03Z", "updated_at": "2019-07-04T12:48:03Z", "closed_at": "2019-07-04T12:48:00Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1188", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1188", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1188.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1188.patch", "merged_at": "2019-07-04T12:48:00Z"}, "body": "In the context of #1112 this PR extracts the `swarm` and `protocols_handler` modules into a separate crate named `libp2p-swarm`.

The provider API is however still untested and (I think) still incomplete (e.g. expiration of provider records).\r\n  * Numerous smaller TODOs encountered in the code.\r\n\r\nThe following public API changes / additions have been made:\r\n\r\n  * Introduced a `KademliaConfig` with new configuration options for the replication factor and query timeouts.\r\n  * Renamed `find_node` to `get_closest_peers`.\r\n  * Renamed `get_value` to `get_record` and `put_value` to `put_record`, introducing a `Quorum` parameter for both functions, replacing the existing `num_results` parameter with clearer semantics.\r\n  * Renamed `add_providing` to `start_providing` and `remove_providing` to `stop_providing`.\r\n  * Added a `bootstrap` function that implements a (almost) standard Kademlia bootstrapping procedure.\r\n  * Renamed `KademliaOut` to `KademliaEvent` with an updated list of constructors (some renaming). All events that report query results now report a `Result` to uniformly permit reporting of errors.\r\n\r\nThe following refactorings have been made:\r\n\r\n  * Introduced some constants.\r\n  * Consolidated `query.rs` and `write.rs` behind a common interface to reduce duplication and facilitate better code reuse, introducing the notion of a query peer \"iterator\". `query/peers/closest.rs` contains the code that was formerly in `query.rs`. `query/peers/fixed.rs` contains a modified variant of `write.rs` (which is removed). The new `query.rs` provides an interface for working with a collection of queries, taking over some code from `behaviour.rs`.\r\n  * Reduced code duplication in tests and switched to the current_thread runtime for polling swarms to avoid spurious errors in the test output due to aborted connections when a test finishes prematurely (e.g. because a quorum of results has been collected).\r\n  * Some additions / improvements to the existing tests.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1174/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1174/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1172", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1172/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1172/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1172/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1172", "id": 454594895, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg3MDEyMzI3", "number": 1172, "title": "Allow customizing the Swarm with TConnInfo", "user": {"login": "tomaka", "id": 1412254, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTIyNTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412254?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka", "html_url": "https://github.com/tomaka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-06-11T09:59:32Z", "updated_at": "2019-06-12T14:21:44Z", "closed_at": "2019-06-12T14:21:40Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1172", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1172", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1172.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1172.patch", "merged_at": "2019-06-12T14:21:40Z"}, "body": "Close #1084\r\nAllows parametrizing the `Swarm` with a `TConnInfo`.

"merged_at": "2019-06-20T11:26:10Z"}, "body": "This is a suggested refactoring of iterative queries (`query.rs`). It addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n  1. Queries no longer terminate prematurely due to counting results from peers farther from the target while results from closer peers are still pending. (#1105).\r\n\r\n  2. Queries no longer ignore reported closer peers that are not duplicates just because they are currently not among the `num_results` closest. The currently `num_results` closest may contain peers marked as failed      or pending / waiting. Hence all reported closer peers that are not duplicates must be considered candidates that may still end up among the `num_results` closest that successfully responded.\r\n\r\n  3. Bounded parallelism based on the `active_counter` was not working correctly, as new (not yet contacted) peers closer to the target may be discovered at any time and thus appear in `closer_peers` before the already active / pending peers.\r\n\r\n  4. The `Frozen` query mechanism allowed all remaining not-yet contacted peers to be contacted, but their results were discarded, because `inject_rpc_result` would only incorporate results while the query is `Iterating`. Moreover, the `Frozen` state was a terminal state. The `Frozen` state has been reworked into a `Stalled` state that implements a slightly more permissive variant of the following from the paper / specs:\r\n     > If a round of FIND_NODEs fails to return a node any closer than the closest already seen, the initiator resends the FIND_NODE to all of the k closest nodes it has not already queried.\r\n\r\n     Importantly, though not explicitly mentioned, the query can move back to `Iterating`      if it makes further progress again as a result of these requests. The `Stalled` state thus allows (temporarily) higher parallelism in an effort to make progress and bring the query to an end.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n\r\n  * Repeated distance calculations between the same peers and the target is avoided.\r\n\r\n  * Enabled by #1108, a more appropriate data structure (`BTreeMap` keyed by `Distance`) for the incrementally updated list of closer peers is used. Besides resulting in a simpler implementation, it yields better performance for queries in larger DHTs. The data structure needs efficient lookups (to avoid duplicates) and insertions at any position, both of which larger(r) vectors are not that good at. Some unscientific comparisons showed a ~40-60% improvement in somewhat pathological scenarios with at least 20 healthy nodes, each  returning a distinct list of closer 20 peers to the requestor. A previous assumption may have been that the vector always stays very small, but that is not the case in larger DHTs: Even if the lists of closer peers reported by the 20 contacted peers are heavily overlapping, typically a lot more than 20 peers have to be (at least temporarily) considered as candidates for the closest peers until the query completes. See also issue (2) above. Even in the case where the list stays close to 20 peers throughout, it still requires a lookup for every single reported closer peer to avoid duplicates.\r\n\r\n  * Cancellation of still pending RPCs upon timeout has been removed. Besides only canceling RPCs that have not yet been sent - a rare case after the timeout elapsed - the implementation actually removed all pending RPCs for a peer, regardless of the query they belong(ed) to. Meaning that a timeout in one query could cancel a pending RPC of a concurrent, more recently started query to the same peer. It is according to the Kademlia paper / specs that a peer that does not respond will not stop the query from terminating, but the query still accepts / incorporates delayed results that come in while the query is still running. This has been realised by further distinguishing between `QueryPeerState::Failed` (permanent) and `QueryPeerState::Unresponsive` (timeout).\r\n\r\n## New Tests\r\n\r\nNew tests have been added for:\r\n\r\n  * Query termination conditions.\r\n  * Bounded parallelism.\r\n  * Absence of duplicates.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1154/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1154/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1152", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1152/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1152/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1152/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1152", "id": 450754628, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg0MDEwMjg1", "number": 1152, "title": "Some improvements to the docs of NetworkBehaviour", "user": {"login": "tomaka", "id": 1412254, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTIyNTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412254?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka", "html_url": "https://github.com/tomaka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2019-05-31T11:34:31Z", "updated_at": "2019-06-03T16:16:07Z", "closed_at": "2019-06-03T16:16:03Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1152", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1152", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1152.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1152.patch", "merged_at": "2019-06-03T16:16:03Z"}, "body": "", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1152/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1152/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
