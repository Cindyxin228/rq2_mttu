"merged_at": "2021-01-12T12:35:12Z"}, "body": "This PR is a continuation of https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1845. To recap the main changes:\r\n\r\n  1. Permit port reuse for local sockets, primarily to facilitate better NAT traversal. In this context `address_translation` is moved back to the `Transport` trait, where it already existed at some point in the past, to allow transport-specific translations, as now used for the TCP transport.\r\n\r\n  2. Use `async-io` instead of macro-based code generation to support both `tokio` and `async-std` with less boilerplate and for easier code maintenance, thereby removing the need for the respective feature flags, similarly to how it was already done for `libp2p-mdns`.\r\n\r\n  3. In `libp2p-tcp`, when listening on all interfaces, instead of regularly querying the interfaces with `get_if_addrs` to be aware of both new and expired addresses, use `if-watch` to be actively notified of interface addresses as they go up/down.\r\n\r\nCompared to https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1845 I made the following changes:\r\n\r\n  * `TcpConfig::new()` is no longer `async` and it creates neither background task nor thread. If port reuse is enabled on `TcpConfig` (and only then), the listen socket addresses are registered for reuse for outbound connections in an `Arc<RwLock<HashSet>>`. They are in turn unregistered when `TcpListenStream`s encounter fatal errors or are dropped.\r\n\r\n  * A `TcpListenStream` uses an `IfWatcher` only if its listen socket is listening on all interfaces, analogously to the previous use of `get_if_addrs` in this case, with the advantage that the `TcpListenStream` is aware of expired addresses immediately. If used, the `IfWatcher` is lazily initialised when polling the `TcpListenStream` for events. Therefore `TcpConfig::new()` need not be `async`, reducing the changes to the public API and making for a smaller diff.\r\n\r\n  * `<TcpConfig as Transport>::address_translation(listen, observed)` now returns `Some(observed)` when port reuse is enabled instead of `None`,  as we want the `observed` address to be advertised to other peers as an \"external address\" as-is.

More concretely I am suggesting to remove `NotifyHandler::All`. An\r\nimplementor of `NetworkBehaviour` can still notify all `ProtocolHandler`s for a given peer by emitting one `NotifyHandler` event per connection to that peer.\r\n\r\n### Reasoning\r\n\r\nThe general ability to notify all handlers for a peer forces events send from the behaviour to the handler to be `Clone`. Reason is that the swarm needs to forward a clone of the event to each handler. A behaviour that always sends events to a single peer only still has to guarantee that that event is `Clone`.\r\n\r\n### Example \r\n\r\nAs a concrete example https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1838/ implementing the libp2p relay spec needs to send substreams between `ProtocolHandler`s. Substreams are always send to concrete `ProtocolHandler`s, never to all `ProtocolHandler`s. Today a substream needs to be wrapped in an `Arc<Mutex<_>>` (or similar) in order to be `Clone` before one can send it to another `ProtocolHandler`. Removing the ability to send to all `ProtocolHandler`s would relief the relay implementation of having to wrap each substream before sending.\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nToday the `ExpandedSwarm` requires `TInEvent` to be `Clone` in order to be able to notify all handlers for a given peer. Instead of removing the feature one could as well introduce a second `TInEvent2` which would not require clone, using the former to notify all handlers and the latter to notify specific handlers. A behaviour only requiring the latter could set the former to `()`. In my eyes this alternative would not be worth the complexity it introduces.\r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell `NotifyHandler::All` is not used in rust-libp2p nor Substrate. Does anyone know of any users of `NotifyHandler::All`?\r\n\r\n**Is anyone objecting to this change or has alternative suggestions?**\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

See https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1872. There are primarily two approaches for dealing with the `9000` bytes MDNS packet size limit: Creating multiple packets or trimming the packet by dropping addresses. Since I didn't find any restriction in the MDNS specifications w.r.t. the number of multicast response packets that can be sent (we don't support or send unicast response packets, I think), I opted for the former. So we now prevent MDNS response packets becoming too large (> 9000 bytes) by using conservative upper bounds and creating multi-packet responses if necessary (effectively when there are more than 29 addresses to encode, which effectively means when the local peer has more than 29 listening addresses, as a peer only responds with its own addresses). I'm only just starting out with studying the MDNS specifications, so feel free to set me straight if I'm doing anything nonsensical here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I opted for just skipping addresses that don't fit into a TXT record or contain invalid characters, instead of failing to send a response (which may contain other valid records), thereby logging a warning for the skipped addresses.\r\n\r\nAs

The dialer eventually detects the failed negotiation as soon as it tries to read from the stream, but the listener either encounters an invalid message or unexpected premature EOF, depending on the payload that the dialer sent prematurely after its protocol proposal. In these cases the listener must be lenient and fail the negotiation \"normally\", i.e. not with a protocol violation or an I/O error. The tests have been expanded to make sure both versions behave uniformly in this manner w.r.t. failed negotiations.

Supersedes https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1863.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAt the moment one can neither get confirmation when a response has been sent on the underlying transport, nor is one aware of response omissions. The latter was originally intended as a feature for support of one-way protocols, which seems like a bad idea in hindsight. The lack of a notification for sent responses may prohibit implementation of some request-response protocols that need to ensure a happens-before relation between sending a response and a subsequent request, besides possible uses for collecting statistics.\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n  * Dropped support for \"one-way\" request-response protocols.\r\n  * New `InboundFailure::ResponseOmission` variant.\r\n  * Removed `InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed` variant.\r\n  * `RequestResponse::send_response()` now returns a `Result`, allowing early detection of failed inbound requests due to timeout or a closed connection.\r\n  * New `RequestResponseEvent::ResponseSent` variant, emitted when the response has been successfully written on the underlying transport connection.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nEven with these changes, there is no _active_ notification for failed inbound requests as a result of connections unexpectedly closing, as is the case for outbound requests. Instead, for pending inbound requests this scenario can be identified, if necessary, either through errors returned on `send_response` or by the absence of both `InboundFailure` and `ResponseSent` events for a particular previously received request. Interest in this situation is not expected to be common and would otherwise require explicitly tracking all inbound requests in the `RequestResponse` behaviour just to actively report `ConnectionClosed` for each pending inbound request in that scenario, which would be a pity. Notably `RequestResponse::send_response` now also synchronously returns an error if the inbound upgrade handling the request has been aborted, due to timeout or closing of the connection, giving more options for graceful error handling for inbound requests. It is also noteworthy that client code that does not call `send_response()` will now necessarily receive a `InboundFailure::ResponseOmission`, so except for the case where a connection closes just after `send_response()` succeeded, client code is usually bound to notice a closed connection already on `send_response()`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This PR does not prohibit (re-)adding `InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed` and dedicated inbound request tracking in the future, and neither would doing so make any changes proposed here obsolete. The above discussion is just to expand on why I think the need for doing so becomes even less likely.\r\n\r\n## Throttled Wrapper Credit Grants\r\n\r\nAs an aside, the `Throttled` wrapper now no longer emits inbound or outbound error events occurring in the context of sending credit requests or responses. This is in addition to not emitting `ResponseSent` events for ACK responses of credit grants. I think the credit requests and responses, including errors, should be completely opaque to the user. If credit messages keep failing, the effect on the public API should merely be that of back-pressure due to running out of credit.", "reactions": {"url":

However, the PR goes a bit further than to just add a single counter to have a more streamlined API. Thus, in order to better track different connection counts and permit configurable limits for these counts and make these available for inspection in an efficient manner (i.e. without linear counting operations), I introduced dedicated connection counters via a `ConnectionCounters` structure maintained by the internal connection pool but exposed on the API via the `NetworkInfo`. All connection states that are counted in this way can also have effective configurable limits.\r\n\r\nAll limits are now configured through a `ConnectionLimits` structure. The new configurable limits are\r\n\r\n  * `ConnectionLimits::max_established_incoming` for limiting the number of concurrent established connections that were incoming.\r\n  * `ConnectionLimits::max_established_outgoing` for limiting the number of concurrent established connections that were outgoing.\r\n\r\nA limit that has been removed because tracking the related counts efficiently would be a bit laborious and I don't think it is particularly useful is\r\n\r\n  * `NetworkConfig::set_outgoing_per_peer_limit()`\r\n\r\nNote that there are still the pre-existing `ConnectionLimits::max_incoming` and `ConnectionLimits::max_outgoing` which correspond to the two new configuration options above, just for pending connections. I also took the liberty to change the connection limits to use `u32` instead of `usize` for their types, which seems more appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Fixed panic in the `Peer` API\r\n\r\nThe `Network::peer()` API allows to iterate mutably over the ongoing connection attempts via `DialingPeer::attempts()`, where each `DialingAttempt` can be `abort()`ed during iteration. However, the iterator did not take into account the changes to the internal iteration offsets when elements are removed. This was discovered while extending the connection limit tests a bit and has been fixed now as a result.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

All added or observed external addresses are added to an ordered list with a finite score (`1`) for every new addition and thus subject to being purged eventually. It is desirable to be able to add addresses to this collection that are retained until explicitly removed and always sorted at the beginning, not influencing the existing semantics for the additional finite scores and expiring addresses. It also seems desirable to let the score of a particular address report / observation be chosen freely, instead of being fixed to `1`. The motivation relates to https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7518.\r\n\r\nTo that end, this PR extends the address score arithmetic used for external addresses with an infinite cardinal, permitting addresses with such a score to be retained \"forever\" or until explicitly removed, thereby exposing address scores on the public API for more insight and configurability.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n  * The score of an (external) address is now not just a `u32` but an `AddressScore`, i.e. either `AddressScore::Finite(u32)` or `AddressScore::Infinite`.\r\n  * Only finitely scored addresses compete among each other for retention in the ordered address list, the same way as before. \"Infinitely scored\" addresses are always retained and sorted at the beginning, i.e. higher than any finite score.\r\n  * `Swarm::add_external_address` now takes both a `Multiaddr` and an `AddressScore`.\r\n  * Analogously to the above, `NetworkBehaviourAction::ReportObservedAddr` now also takes an `AddressScore` in addition to the `Multiaddr`. The `Identify` behaviour reports all addresses with a finite score of `1`, i.e. the same semantics as before.\r\n  * A new method `Swarm::remove_external_address` for explicit removal, regardless of score. This allows for explicit curation of the external address list.\r\n  * Iterating over the external addresses now also provides access to the score via iterating over `AddressRecord`s.\r\n  * The external addresses given to the `NetworkBehaviour::poll` are also accompanied by their score (again via `AddressRecord`s).\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

This problem manifests itself in potential stalls / timeouts during protocol negotiation, because a peer does not necessarily wait for confirmation of a protocol before it sends the proposal for the next protocol upgrade. E.g. `/multistream/1.0.0 \\n /mplex/6.7.0` for the mplex upgrade may already be received and buffered by the `Framed` of the plaintext handshake by a peer before the handshake is complete. That peer will read the final handshake frame but then discard the remaining read buffer of `Framed`, leaving the remote waiting for the protocol confirmation for the next upgrade, but that proposal got \"lost\". The problem first appeared in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1765 where it was missed during review.\r\n\r\nThis surfaced, without looking for it, during some benchmark attempts with the TCP transport and plaintext protocol in order to settle https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/802. However, because the symptoms are the same, I'm reasonably certain that this is the actual cause of the early connection negotiation stalls observed in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1629#issuecomment-701396435, unrelated to the random upgrade timeouts (which should already be fixed), since that test setup intentionally uses the plaintext protocol.

This has permitted two improvements:\r\n     1. Message size verification during publishing (report to the user if the message is too large before attempting to send).\r\n     2. Message fragmentation. If an RPC is too large it is fragmented into its sub components and sent in smaller chunks. \r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThe peer eXchange protocol defined in the v1.1 spec is inactive in its current form. The current implementation permits sending `PeerId` in `PRUNE` messages, however a `PeerId` is not sufficient to form a new connection to a peer. A `Signed Address Record` is required to safely transmit peer identity information. Once these are confirmed (https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/217) a future PR will implement these and make PX usable. \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Final Note\r\n\r\nThis is currently undergoing further testing and an audit and I may modify this slightly as bugs come up :)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1720/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 5, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1720/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
