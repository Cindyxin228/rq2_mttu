Also adds a smoke test for backpressure.\r\n\r\nFixes #3144.\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nFixes #3144 following proposed idea nr.2 from @mxinden.\r\n> Don't send a STOP_SENDING on DROP IFF the remote already closed the write side.\r\n>\r\n> -  That would be in-line with what upstream quinn does. https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/blob/1d390af2facdf424c7feb470909fffc29a1dca6c/quinn/src/recv_stream.rs#L396-L400\r\n\r\nI implemented it slightly different compared to quinn, since quinn only sets the `all_data_read` flag when the stream finishes while reading. In identify however we might receive a FIN for a stream on which we are not reading anymore, thus what we do now is in the `drop` implementation we manually check the receive stream again if it has finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.

Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, we would erroneously always go into the `WaitingUser` (now called `WaitingBehaviour`) state after receiving a message on an inbound stream. However, the `AddProvider` message does not warrant a \"response\" from the behaviour. Thus, any incoming `AddProvider` message would result in a stale substream that would eventually be dropped as soon as more than 32 inbound streams have been opened.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, we inline the message handling into the upper match block and perform the correct state transition upon each message. For `AddProvider`, we go back into `WaitingMessage` because the spec mandates that we need to be ready to receive more messages on an inbound stream.\r\n\r\nFixes #3048.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n<!-- Any notes or remarks you'd like to make about the PR. -->\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Reference any related issues.-->\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n<!-- Unresolved questions, if any. -->\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.

For example, here's cargo-nextest recommending the same: https://nexte.st/book/installing-from-source.html#installing-from-cratesio\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nI don't think this should have any immediate impact on the project one way or another.

refactor our continuous integration workflow with the following goals in mind:\r\n\r\n- Run as few jobs as possible\r\n- Have the jobs finish as fast as possible\r\n- Have the jobs redo as little work as possible\r\n\r\nThere are only so many jobs that GitHub Actions will run in parallel.\r\nThus, it makes sense to not create massive matrices but instead group\r\nthings together meaningfully.\r\n\r\nThe new `test` job will:\r\n\r\n- Run once for each crate\r\n- Ensure that the crate compiles on its specified MSRV\r\n- Ensure that the tests pass\r\n- Ensure that there are no semver violations\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement to before because we are running all of these\r\nin parallel which speeds up execution and highlights more errors at\r\nonce. Previously, tests run later in the pipeline would not get run\r\nat all until you make sure the \"first\" one passes.\r\n\r\nWe also previously did not verify the MSRV of each crate, making the\r\nsetting in the `Cargo.toml` rather pointless.\r\n\r\nThe new `cross` job supersedes the existing `wasm` job.\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement because we now also compile the crate for\r\nwindows and MacOS. Something that wasn't checked before.\r\nWe assume that checking MSRV and the tests under Linux is good enough.\r\nHence, this job only checks for compile-errors.\r\n\r\nThe new `feature_matrix` ensures we compile correctly with certain feature combinations.\r\n\r\n`libp2p` exposes a fair few feature-flags. Some of the combinations\r\nare worth checking independently. For the moment, this concerns only\r\nthe executor related transports together with the executor flags but\r\nthis list can easily be extended.\r\n\r\nThe new `clippy` job runs for `stable` and `beta` rust.\r\n\r\nClippy gets continuously extended with new lints. Up until now, we would only\r\nlearn about those as soon as a new version of Rust is released and CI would\r\nrun the new lints. This leads to unrelated failures in CI. Running clippy on with `beta`\r\nRust gives us a heads-up of 6 weeks before these lints land on stable.\r\n\r\nFixes #2951.\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nDepends-On: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3131\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nWe could merge `cross` and `feature_matrix` together by adding another matrix variable that is either set to `--all-features` or `--features=\"mdns ...\"`. Should we?\r\n\r\n<!-- Unresolved questions, if any. -->\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.

This prevents standalone usage which forces us to depend on `libp2p` in all our tests where we want to derive a `NetworkBehaviour`.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a `prelude` option that - by default - points to `libp2p::swarm::derive_prelude`, a new module added to `libp2p_swarm`. With this config option, users of `libp2p_swarm` can now refer to the macro without depending on `libp2p`, breaking the circular dependency in our workspace. For consistency with the ecosystem, the macro is now also re-exported by `libp2p_swarm` instead of `libp2p` at the same position as the trait that it implements.\r\n\r\nLastly, we introduce an off-by-default `macros` feature flag that shrinks the dependency tree for users that don't need the derive macro.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3055/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3055/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3051/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051", "id": 1417930545, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBSHhDc5BQ-lS", "number": 3051, "title": "build(deps): Update multiaddr requirement from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0", "user": {"login": "dependabot[bot]", "id": 49699333, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/dependabot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2340311223, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQwMzExMjIz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/dependencies", "name": "dependencies", "color": "0366d6", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update a dependency file"}, {"id": 2527056927, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNTI3MDU2OTI3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/labels/rust", "name": "rust", "color": "000000", "default": false, "description": "Pull requests that update Rust code"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-10-21T08:03:43Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-02T12:57:36Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-02T12:57:22Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/3051", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3051.patch", "merged_at": "2022-11-02T12:57:22Z"}, "body": "Updates the requirements on [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr/releases\">multiaddr's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.15.0</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a> for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multiaddr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">multiaddr's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>0.15.0 [2022-10-20]</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>WebRTC</code> instance for <code>Multiaddr</code>.

See https://github.com/thomaseizinger/rust-libp2p/pull/31 for an example.\r\n- Every PR that has the `send-it` label will be added to a merge-queue. Alternatively, one can also use `@Mergifyio queue` to achieve the same thing but I found that cumbersome to type :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\nThe configuration file specifies the use of `squash` merges. The commit message is configured to be the same as what Github normally uses. See https://github.com/thomaseizinger/rust-libp2p/commit/8f68d708840f7fade1b2e2ab94ed205bfba55c57 for an example commit created via the merge queue.\r\n\r\nOne neat feature here is that we can configure the commit message body in the pull request. See https://github.com/thomaseizinger/rust-libp2p/pull/27 for an example. If the section `## Commit message body` is not present, a fallback of an empty string is used. See https://github.com/thomaseizinger/rust-libp2p/commit/1cf4f5a0be4d4a3bbccdddaac21b60231e4459cb and https://github.com/thomaseizinger/rust-libp2p/pull/29.\r\n\r\nMergify will automatically respect all branch protection rules that are in place. Any CI job that is marked as \"required\" needs to pass before a PR from the merge queue can land in master. We could specify additional conditions here but I don't think we need any.\r\n\r\nThe intended workflow with this is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. We review and approve PRs as normal.\r\n1. No magic happens without explicit action.\r\n1. Once we are happy with a PR to go in, a maintainer needs to either add the `send-it` label or comment with `@Mergifyio queue`.\r\n1. Prior to adding the label, we would edit the PR description and add a `## Commit message body` section with the desired message. This could for example include adding `Co-authored-by` lines or just a longer commit message explaining what the PR does.\r\n1.

Thus:\r\n\r\n- I want to make sure we listen to the community and align our work accordingly. I invite **everyone** to leave feedback here.\r\n- The below is only planning work for the maintainers, not the community. Folks from the community may suggest and pick up work not prioritized (e.g. [Kademlia efficient querying](#kademlia-efficient-querying)) nor mentioned on this roadmap and we (maintainers) should be supporting them as best as we can.\r\n\r\nI consider this more of a short-lived document, enabling everyone working and using rust-libp2p to discuss and eventually align on a common mission, making prioritization explicit. Once done, it will likely be outdated quickly and thus I suggest never actualy merge it. In my eyes, continued project management is better done via GitHub issues and thus all the information here should eventually make it into the corresponding GitHub issues if not already the case.\r\n\r\nAlso see:\r\n- [libp2p roadmap](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)\r\n- [go-libp2p roadmap](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/1784)\r\n\r\nThe items in this roadmap are ordered by importance where I define importance as:\r\n\r\n- Enable others to build with rust-libp2p before building components ourself.\r\n  - e.g. cross behaviour communication over Kademlia client mode where the former enables the latter\r\n- Invest into tools that enable us to work more efficiently\r\n  - e.g. Testground and release process]\r\n- Better do one thing well than many things close to right.\r\n  - e.g. deprioritize BitSwap implementation and continue on[QUIC even once first ieration is merged. That does not imply that we won't support community members implementing it.\r\n- Improve existing components before introducing new ones.\r\n  - e.g. Kademlia client mode before WebTransport\r\n \r\nI am curious what folks think and again encourage everyone to share their thoughts.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2997/reactions",

Currently, users of libp2p need to activate a separate feature for each sub-crate that is specific to the executor they want to use, i.e. `tcp-tokio`, `dns-tokio`, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we deprecate these features in favor of a single `tokio` and `async-std` feature. Thanks to cargo's support for weak-features, we can forward the respective executor feature to each sub-crate without pulling them in as dependencies unless the user also activated the corresponding protocol (`dns`, `tcp` etc).\r\n\r\nDeprecation warnings don't work on re-exports so I had to (temporarily) define a new module in `lib.rs`.

Previously, we were not passing `--workspace` to clippy which means it didn't lint a lot of source files. I am not sure which subset it was linting and which one it skipped but with this PR, we should be linting every source file in this repository.\r\n\r\n## Review guide\r\n\r\nThis PR is best reviewed patch-by-patch. The massive diff comes from the gossipsub tests but most of that is just removing one layer of modules which is done in a separate commit.\r\n\r\n- The first commit is completely auto-generated by running `clippy --fix`. Probably not worth reviewing. If you run the command mentioned in the commit locally and follow it with `cargo fmt`, you should get the same result!\r\n- The second commit is manual changes. Those should probably be reviewed.\r\n- The third and forth commit just moves everything from the `tests` module one layer up, fixing the last clippy lint. I tried to split this up so the diff shows how minimal the changes are but Git chokes on it and likes to see unchanged newlines instead of just showing the whitespace diff. You can verify locally that it is just whitespace changes by running: `git diff 9443c7a4 9443c7a4^ --ignore-all-space`\r\n- The fifth commit runs `cargo fmt`.

Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls.
