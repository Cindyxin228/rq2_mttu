This\r\n`HashSet` is shared with the `TcpListenStream`s via an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`. Given that `Clone` is\r\n`derive`d on `GenTcpConfig`, cloning a `GenTcpConfig`, results in both instances sharing the same\r\nset of listen addresses. This is not intuitive.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is for example error prone in the scenario where one wants to speak both plain DNS/TCP and\r\nWebsockets. Say a user creates the transport in the following way:\r\n\r\n``` Rust\r\nlet transport = {\r\n    let tcp = tcp::TcpConfig::new().nodelay(true).port_reuse(true);\r\n    let dns_tcp = dns::DnsConfig::system(tcp).await?;\r\n    let ws_dns_tcp = websocket::WsConfig::new(dns_tcp.clone());\r\n    dns_tcp.or_transport(ws_dns_tcp)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth `dns_tcp` and `ws_dns_tcp` share the set of listen addresses, given the `dns_tcp.clone()` to\r\ncreate the `ws_dns_tcp`. Thus, with port-reuse, a Websocket dial might reuse a DNS/TCP listening\r\nport instead of a Websocket listening port.\r\n\r\nWith this commit a user is forced to do the below, preventing the above error:\r\n\r\n``` Rust\r\nlet transport = {\r\n    let dns_tcp = dns::DnsConfig::system(tcp::TcpConfig::new().nodelay(true).port_reuse(true)).await?;\r\n    let ws_dns_tcp = websocket::WsConfig::new(\r\n        dns::DnsConfig::system(tcp::TcpConfig::new().nodelay(true).port_reuse(true)).await?,\r\n    );\r\n    dns_tcp.or_transport(ws_dns_tcp)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please write a summary of your changes and why you made them.-->\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Reference any related issues.-->\r\nFollow up on https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2670 //CC @pj50\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.

The listening client can then use the public\r\naddresses of the relay to advertise itself as reachable under a relayed\r\naddress (`/<public-relay-addr>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<listening-client-peer-id>`).\r\n\r\nThe above operates under the assumption that the relay knows its public address.\r\nA relay learns its public address from remote peers, via the identify protocol.\r\nIn the case where the relay just started up, the listening client might be the\r\nvery first node to connect to it.\r\n\r\nSuch scenario allows for a race condition. The listening client requests a\r\nreservation from the relay, while the relay requests its public address from the\r\nlistening client. The former needs to contain the response from the latter.\r\n\r\nThis commit serializes the two requests, making sure, in the case of a freshly\r\nstarted relay, that the listening client tells the relay its public address\r\nbefore requesting a reservation from the relay.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please write a summary of your changes and why you made them.-->\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nFollow up to https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2642.

Not ready for review yet._</s>\r\n\r\nRemove the concept of `Listener`s from the `Transport` trait. Instead require the Transport itself to implement a stream-like API with `Transport::poll`. Transport implementations can then internally implement the logic for managing one or multiple listeners.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this change is that the concept of multiple listeners is rather TCP specific and introduces unnecessary complexity for the QUIC transport (https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2289#issuecomment-1119872606). \r\nApart from that, this generally follows the same direction as #2648 :\r\n> 2. Follow the style of \"mutate state and return result via poll\", same as we do for many other parts of rust-libp2p\r\n\r\nThe change includes:\r\n- Remove `Transport::Listener` and change `Transport::listen_on` to just return a `Result<ListenerId, _>`\r\n- Add `Transport::poll`, which returns `TransportEvent`s  (replacing the former `swarm/connection/ListenersEvent). Listeners should be driven here. \r\n- Remove `swarm/connection/ListenersStream`, instead poll the boxed transport directly in the swarm\r\n- Adapt transports/tcp: Wrap the `GenTcpConfig` into a new struct `GenTcpTransport` that implements `Transport`:\r\n   - Manage multiple listener streams (this is essentially the logic that used to be in `swarm/connection/ListenersStream`\r\n- Adapt some of the existing Transports to this (not all yet, but that's only because I'd like to discuss the general direction first, not because I have concerns with specific transports)\r\n- Adapt tests of transports/tcp, core and swarm to this change -> tests pass\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nRelevant discussions:\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2529#issuecomment-1087384988\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions/2113#discussioncomment-944923\r\n- https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2289#issuecomment-1119872606\r\n- similar direction as #2648 \r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n**Transport::dial**\r\n\r\nI did not change how `Transport::dial` works. I originally planned to also remove `Transport::Dial` and push that logic into `Transport::poll` as well. The problem with this would be that it does not work well with the concurrent-dial logic. \r\n `ConcurrentDial` currently drives multiple dial futures (from potentially multiple transports) at the same time. Once the first succeeds, it drops the other ongoing dials. If the Transport would internally manage the `Dial` future, this logic would not work anymore. What we could do is something like the following:\r\n  - Each dial is associated with a `DialId`, `ConcurrentDial` tracks the dial-ids of concurrent dials\r\n  - We add `Transport::abort_dial` that can be called from the `Pool` once the first dial of a concurrent dialing batch succeeds\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is worth the extra complexity. Happy to hear alternative suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Open TODOs\r\n- [x] Add `Transport::remove_listener`\r\n- [x] Track listening addresses\r\n- [x] Adapt all remaining transports to the change \r\n- [x] Clean code, Fix docs\r\n- [x] (not part of this PR, but should be done before merging this) draft how the QUIC implementation of #2289 could be adapted to this change (CC @kpp)\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] A changelog entry has been made in the appropriate crates\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2652/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2652/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2646/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646", "id": 1234319511, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBSHhDc43vOaN", "number": 2646, "title": "Set Metrics as weak dependency", "user": {"login": "maschad", "id": 9755286, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk3NTUyODY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9755286?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad", "html_url": "https://github.com/maschad", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maschad/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2022-05-12T18:05:49Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-10T16:36:29Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-10T16:36:29Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/2646", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2646.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-10T16:36:29Z"}, "body": "# Description\r\nUpgraded to [1.60.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html) in order to enable metrics as a _weak dependency_  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8832\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2286\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.

Thus servers should reject dial-back requests from clients with a non-global IP address, and at the same time clients should only pick connected peers as servers if they are global.\r\nBehind a config flag (enabled by default) to also allow use-cases where AutoNAT is needed within a private network.\r\nContinuation/ alternative to #2526 (cc @hamamo). Opened as a draft for now because of the open questions below.\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\nFixes #2514.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nThe `is_global` check for Ipv4 and Ipv6 addresses currently implements the same logic as `std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_global`, `std::net::Ipv6Addr::is_global`, which are at the time of writing unstable behind the `ip` flag. \r\n(See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27709 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85604.)\r\n\r\nFor Ipv4 most of the internally called methods are stable, apart from the checks for `is_shared`, `is_reserved` and `is_benchmarking`. Could we just remove those checks? In case of `is_shared` the peer is still eligible for a dial-back and the other two cases should never occur in practice, no? In general, would it be enough to just check for `is_private`, `is_loopback` and `is_link_local`? I am not sure, but since we only use this check for observed addresses, can any of the other cases even happen?\r\n\r\nFor Ipv6 there is still some ongoing discussion around the `is_global` check, because is currently checks for the (global) scope of the address rather than global reachability (See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86634 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85604). There are ongoing efforts to fix this (and eventually stabilize all `ip` methods), but they seem to be inactive since last year. Is this something that we could / should help push to completion?\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to
