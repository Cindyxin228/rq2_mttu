folks,\r\n\r\nI believe this adds support for long mDNS names, as reported in issue https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1232 \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of additional changes that I made in order to test the scenario where long mDNS names are encountered, so I'd love to get feedback about unintended consequences: \r\n\r\n* ~~I added the `std` feature for `ring` in the top-level `Cargo.toml`. I wasn't able to build or test within the mdns directory without it (eg: `cd misc/mdns; cargo test` would fail on `ring` error traits).~~\r\n* I added support for creating `PeerId` from the `Identity` multihash. It's in line with the spec, but I'm not familiar with the nuances. This was done so that I could generate long mDNS names for tests.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1287/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Let me know if this bothers you. I might be able to change it with temporary files in the build scripts.\r\n\r\n- I think in the long run we should regenerate the files in our CI on each run to ensure the generated files stay in sync with the `.proto` files.
