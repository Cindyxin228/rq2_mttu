https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/5712.\r\n\r\nI have changed to `ClosestIter` structure to only allocate when `kbucket_size` is higher than `K_VALUE` and only once along the life of `ClosestIter`. I think I did not break anything but I would really like some experienced people with Kademlia to take a look (@guillaumemichel :wink:).\r\n\r\n## Notes & open questions\r\n\r\n~~I have kept the `sort_by` in the `Iterator` implementation of `ClosestIter` but I think we could remove every allocation whatsoever if we used `min_by` but I'm not sure that it would not change the research behaviour that's why I did not changed it. If experienced developers think that it would be equivalent I will do it.~~\r\nIt was a dumb question.
