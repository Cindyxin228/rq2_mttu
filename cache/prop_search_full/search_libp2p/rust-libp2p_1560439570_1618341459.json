href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/199\">#199</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release changes how <code>derive_builder</code> handles errors; instead of returning a string, a structured error is now returned from <code>build</code>. This implements <code>std::error::Error</code>, making it easy to use alongside libraries such as <code>anyhow</code>, and it is replaceable, making it easy to drop in your library's own error instead. In addition, this approach means that builders no longer force any allocations, useful in <code>no_std</code> contexts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/9d2ee6ffb7864401e5299b6104721db7a742223b\"><code>9d2ee6f</code></a> Bump version to 0.10.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/6f6c0fe53f7f88afd5951058a967a741f76027df\"><code>6f6c0fe</code></a> Update README with 0.10.0 material</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/7cde4861025278c3af73236263e67c27ac6e20d9\"><code>7cde486</code></a> Add setter(each = &quot;...&quot;) option to extend collection-like fields (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/199\">#199</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/c72cd242b282d12dcc55dcb8d3e322830c26eec2\"><code>c72cd24</code></a> Safely support custom errors (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/194\">#194</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/ee13c513e97cf61ea4871b3b6233c833fb1aed37\"><code>ee13c51</code></a> Update all dependencies to latest</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/c86f615daf40559be31798429ce366b2387d0c98\"><code>c86f615</code></a> Remove all mentions of Travis</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/39b6ce694588ea746037e35beff45672ea86a2b1\"><code>39b6ce6</code></a> Cumulative CHANGELOG update</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/a9259a896c705b8f44f3d0cff1aa0e18557dffdf\"><code>a9259a8</code></a> Add derive_builder_macro to deploy script</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/76b64542d2406836b62758daa7b7741cc4073fb5\"><code>76b6454</code></a> Shrink derive_builder_core's public API (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/189\">#189</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/commit/aa07ba19c356e250d0f3768817898e7c249a13e1\"><code>aa07ba1</code></a> Remove skeptic (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/188\">#188</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

When a new or expired listen address is reported by the `Swarm`, it can result in an active push of an identify message to all connected peers. Two points worth noting:\r\n\r\n  1. I've made this behaviour configurable and _disabled_ it by default. I think that having such new features opt-in initially avoids surprises and allows selective experimentation in a more controlled manner. Also, since listen addresses are often not directly reachable due to NAT, it may be better if it is selectively enabled for those nodes who are known to be deployed with publicly reachable listen addresses. Lastly, if there are potentially _a lot_ of connected peers, this kind of active push may cause quite a traffic burst. If it proves beneficial over time without any downsides, it can still be made the default later. However, I generally think that active pushes are more likely to be useful if they are targeted to specific subsets of peers.\r\n  2. I have not included `inject_new_external_addr` as a trigger for an automatic push. I am somewhat concerned that, given that these addresses are reported by remote peers, it would make it too easy to remotely make a node spam all its connected peers with messages, possibly even with invalid data, since this would essentially provide a remote trigger for a kind of broadcast. One could of course add defensive measures via some form of throttling, but at least a naive implementation, as I've done here for `inject_new_listen_addr` and `inject_expired_listen_addr`, seems to be too easy to abuse.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2004/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2004/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2003", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2003/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2003/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2003/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2003", "id": 834598538, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTk1MzgxNTI1", "number": 2003, "title": "Add notable users:", "user": {"login": "rklaehn", "id": 248257, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODI1Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/248257?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn", "html_url": "https://github.com/rklaehn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rklaehn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-03-18T09:57:51Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-18T10:50:31Z", "closed_at": "2021-03-18T10:50:31Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/2003", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2003", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2003.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2003.patch", "merged_at": "2021-03-18T10:50:31Z"}, "body": "Add notable users:\r\n\r\n- ipfs-embed.

In that context, peers that were queried in a successful `Kademlia::get_record` operation but did not return a record are now returned in the `GetRecordOk::no_record` list of peer IDs as additional information which may be used to choose which of these peers to send (one of) the found records to.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this PR originates in the discussion at https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1577, i.e. the inability for libp2p-kad itself to do write-back caching of records after successful lookups when a quorum > 1 is used. It is deemed best and the most flexible to provide the means to do so on the API. There may be other use-cases for targeted store operations as well. That is to say, `Kademlia::put_record_to` is intended as to augment the use of `Kademlia::put_record` with occasional targeted store operations, not as a replacement. Though if someone wishes to only use `Kademlia::put_record_to`, that can obviously be done, the resulting DHT then just no longer has the properties attributed to Kademlia.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it would be worthwhile to be able to configure (i.e. enable/disable) the default behaviour of write-back caching upon lookups with a quorum of 1. Maybe some users would like full control over that behaviour by disabling it and doing any such writes themselves via `Kademlia::put_record_to`.

We received reports that mdns was responsible for 25% to 75% of network traffic. As you can imagine our customers weren't very happy about that. This PR massively reduces the mdns bandwidth requirements.\r\n\r\nMdns needs two sockets, a send socket and a receive socket. The receive socket is listening on the mdns broadcast address. When you join a network and receive an `IfEvent::Up` event the send socket is used to send an mdns query to the broadcast address. Everyone listening on the broadcast address responds with their mdns records, including yourself, to the broadcast address, so everyone gets a fresh view of the network and the existing peers learn about your records.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the case where you join a network and your initial discovery message was lost I readded a timer that by default will send a mdns query to the broadcast address if there has been no incoming mdns queries in the last five minutes. This timeout is configurable.\r\n\r\n~There is still one remaining issue and that is making `if-watch` pollable using manual futures. But that should minimally effect this PR other than requiring a version bump.~\r\n\r\n~Companion PR https://github.com/ipfs-rust/if-watch/pull/7~", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1977/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1977/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1962", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1962/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1962/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1962/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1962", "id": 813484513, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc3NjI1MzUx", "number": 1962, "title": "[swarm] Remove substream-specific protocol negotiation version.", "user": {"login": "romanb", "id": 177309, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzMwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177309?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb", "html_url": "https://github.com/romanb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/romanb/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-02-22T13:06:35Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-01T13:35:21Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-25T10:35:53Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1962", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1962", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1962.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1962.patch", "merged_at": "2021-02-25T10:35:52Z"}, "body": "Remove the option for a substream-specific multistream select protocol version override.

Incoming frames for unknown streams\nare now ignored, instead of triggering a stream reset for the\nremote.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.8.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade step 4 of 4.

All crates in `protocols/` depend on `libp2p-swarm` whereas none of the crates in `transports/` do. All of the crates in `transports/` can be used in the `Transport` construction and upgrade process.

based on https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1927 - a proper diff until that PR is merged can be [seen here](https://github.com/romanb/rust-libp2p/compare/trust-dns...romanb:dnsaddr).\r\n\r\nIn order to correctly resolve `/dnsaddr` addresses, the DNS transport needs to be given \"fully qualified\" multiaddresses when dialing, i.e. those that end with the `/p2p/...` protocol, since it chooses from the TXT records such addresses with a matching suffix of the address being dialed. So to pick the addresses for the correct peer, the `/p2p` protocol needs to be at the end of the address being dialed. This essentially goes back to #1462. So to address #1462 as well as implement `/dnsaddr` resolution,  we now make sure that dialing always uses such fully qualified addresses by appending the `/p2p` protocol as necessary in the `Network` of `libp2p-core` before giving the address for dialing to the transport. This is mostly transparent for the `PeerId`-based APIs, i.e. it is of course still possible to use a `PeerId` together with an \"unqualified\" address for dialing. It is just that at the end of the day, `Transport::dial()` always gets a fully-qualified address (when called from the `Network` anyway) and hence transports now  permit a trailing `/p2p` suffix (and in the case of the DNS transport, even make essential use of it).\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect, `Network::dial(addr)` and `Swarm::dial_addr(addr)` now also handle \"fully-qualified\" `/p2p` addresses, since the `Network` will then take the peer ID from the end of the address.\r\n\r\nA related change as part of implementing `/dnsaddr` resolution is that `libp2p-dns` now actually tries to use all resolved addresses (well, up to a fixed maximum of dialing attempts).\r\n\r\nThe net result of these changes can be seen in the now cleaned up [`ipfs-kad` example](https://github.com/romanb/rust-libp2p/blob/dnsaddr/examples/ipfs-kad.rs), which can finally make use of `/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1931/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1931/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1930", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1930/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1930/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1930/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1930", "id": 788643735, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU3MTE2Mzkw", "number": 1930, "title": "[Gossipsub] Prevent non-published messages being added to caches", "user": {"login": "AgeManning", "id": 7454587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTQ1ODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7454587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning", "html_url": "https://github.com/AgeManning", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AgeManning/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-01-19T01:52:28Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-08T02:34:06Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-20T09:47:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1930", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1930", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1930.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1930.patch", "merged_at": "2021-01-20T09:47:06Z"}, "body": "This addresses issue #1926. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Gossipsub messages may not be published on a topic if there are no subscribed peers on that topic, however they are being added to a duplicate cache.

With this PR, a failed publish now definitively indicates the message will not be published on the network and the user is required to re-submit at a later time, once sufficient peers exist on the topic.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1930/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1930/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1928", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1928/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1928/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1928/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1928", "id": 787072662, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU1ODQ1MTU3", "number": 1928, "title": "is_pending_outbound fixes", "user": {"login": "whereistejas", "id": 19555244, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU1MjQ0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19555244?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas", "html_url": "https://github.com/whereistejas", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whereistejas/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2021-01-15T17:42:05Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-21T13:49:54Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-21T13:34:59Z", "author_association": "NONE", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1928", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1928", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1928.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1928.patch", "merged_at": "2021-01-21T13:34:59Z"}, "body": "`is_pending_outbound` returns true if the connection\r\nto the mentioned peer hasn't been established, yet.\r\n\r\nCloses issue: #1885\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Tejas Sanap <sanap.tejas@gmail.com>", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1928/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1928/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1927", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1927/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1927/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1927/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1927", "id": 787014836, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU1Nzk3NDkw", "number": 1927, "title": "[libp2p-dns] Use trust-dns-resolver (with either async-std or tokio).

This also serves as a first step for https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1920, which will build on this work. \r\n\r\nSince `trust-dns-resolver` and related crates already provide decent support for both `async-std` and `tokio`, we make use of that here in `libp2p-dns`, offering analogous `async-std` and `tokio` features. Just like with `libp2p-tcp`, the `async-std` variant is enabled by default. This PR is only pending a new release that includes https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/pull/1354, which is why it is still pointing to a git dependency. Also just like with `libp2p-tcp`, the `libp2p-dns` tests are exercised for both runtimes.\r\n\r\nSince `trust-dns-resolver` provides many useful configuration options and error details, central types of `trust-dns-resolver` like `ResolverConfig`, `ResolverOpts` and `ResolveError` are re-exposed in the API of `libp2p-dns`. Full encapsulation\r\ndoes not seem preferable in this case. We also re-export the (currently tokio-only) features for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS (via rustls).\r\n\r\nI also consolidated the top-level utility functions of the `libp2p` crate: There is now just `fn development_transport()` (available with default features) and `fn tokio_development_transport()` (available when the corresponding tokio features are enabled). I think that is sufficient and I removed the minor variation that also included `pnet` support into the development transport.", "reactions": {"url":

"merged_at": "2021-01-12T12:35:12Z"}, "body": "This PR is a continuation of https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1845. To recap the main changes:\r\n\r\n  1. Permit port reuse for local sockets, primarily to facilitate better NAT traversal. In this context `address_translation` is moved back to the `Transport` trait, where it already existed at some point in the past, to allow transport-specific translations, as now used for the TCP transport.\r\n\r\n  2. Use `async-io` instead of macro-based code generation to support both `tokio` and `async-std` with less boilerplate and for easier code maintenance, thereby removing the need for the respective feature flags, similarly to how it was already done for `libp2p-mdns`.\r\n\r\n  3. In `libp2p-tcp`, when listening on all interfaces, instead of regularly querying the interfaces with `get_if_addrs` to be aware of both new and expired addresses, use `if-watch` to be actively notified of interface addresses as they go up/down.\r\n\r\nCompared to https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1845 I made the following changes:\r\n\r\n  * `TcpConfig::new()` is no longer `async` and it creates neither background task nor thread. If port reuse is enabled on `TcpConfig` (and only then), the listen socket addresses are registered for reuse for outbound connections in an `Arc<RwLock<HashSet>>`. They are in turn unregistered when `TcpListenStream`s encounter fatal errors or are dropped.\r\n\r\n  * A `TcpListenStream` uses an `IfWatcher` only if its listen socket is listening on all interfaces, analogously to the previous use of `get_if_addrs` in this case, with the advantage that the `TcpListenStream` is aware of expired addresses immediately. If used, the `IfWatcher` is lazily initialised when polling the `TcpListenStream` for events. Therefore `TcpConfig::new()` need not be `async`, reducing the changes to the public API and making for a smaller diff.\r\n\r\n  * `<TcpConfig as Transport>::address_translation(listen, observed)` now returns `Some(observed)` when port reuse is enabled instead of `None`,  as we want the `observed` address to be advertised to other peers as an \"external address\" as-is. I believe that returning `None` as was done in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1845 is an oversight, but please correct me if I'm mistaken.\r\n\r\n  * More elaborate documentation, especially for the new `TcpConfig::port_reuse()` option as well as small test additions.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1887/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1887/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1886", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1886/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1886/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1886/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1886", "id": 762776538, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTM3Mjg5NzE2", "number": 1886, "title": "protocols/request-response: Emit InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed", "user": {"login": "mxinden", "id": 7047859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc4NTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden", "html_url": "https://github.com/mxinden", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-12-11T19:09:37Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-16T20:34:05Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-16T15:03:36Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/1886", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1886", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1886.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1886.patch", "merged_at": "2020-12-16T15:03:36Z"}, "body": "A user of libp2p-request-response is guaranteed to receive an additional event\r\nafter receiving a request via `RequestResponseEvent::Message`.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the request:\r\n\r\n- If the user responds in time and the connection is still alive, the\r\nuser can expect a `ResponseSent`.\r\n\r\n- If the user drops the response channel, the user can expect an\r\n`InboundFailure::ResponseOmission`.\r\n\r\n- If the user does not respond in time, the user can expect an\r\n`InboundFailure::Timeout`.\r\n\r\nThus far the user did not receive an event when the connection to the\r\npeer closes.

More concretely I am suggesting to remove `NotifyHandler::All`. An\r\nimplementor of `NetworkBehaviour` can still notify all `ProtocolHandler`s for a given peer by emitting one `NotifyHandler` event per connection to that peer.\r\n\r\n### Reasoning\r\n\r\nThe general ability to notify all handlers for a peer forces events send from the behaviour to the handler to be `Clone`. Reason is that the swarm needs to forward a clone of the event to each handler. A behaviour that always sends events to a single peer only still has to guarantee that that event is `Clone`.\r\n\r\n### Example \r\n\r\nAs a concrete example https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1838/ implementing the libp2p relay spec needs to send substreams between `ProtocolHandler`s. Substreams are always send to concrete `ProtocolHandler`s, never to all `ProtocolHandler`s. Today a substream needs to be wrapped in an `Arc<Mutex<_>>` (or similar) in order to be `Clone` before one can send it to another `ProtocolHandler`. Removing the ability to send to all `ProtocolHandler`s would relief the relay implementation of having to wrap each substream before sending.\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nToday the `ExpandedSwarm` requires `TInEvent` to be `Clone` in order to be able to notify all handlers for a given peer. Instead of removing the feature one could as well introduce a second `TInEvent2` which would not require clone, using the former to notify all handlers and the latter to notify specific handlers. A behaviour only requiring the latter could set the former to `()`. In my eyes this alternative would not be worth the complexity it introduces.\r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell `NotifyHandler::All` is not used in rust-libp2p nor Substrate. Does anyone know of any users of `NotifyHandler::All`?\r\n\r\n**Is anyone objecting to this change or has alternative suggestions?**\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

See https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1872. There are primarily two approaches for dealing with the `9000` bytes MDNS packet size limit: Creating multiple packets or trimming the packet by dropping addresses. Since I didn't find any restriction in the MDNS specifications w.r.t. the number of multicast response packets that can be sent (we don't support or send unicast response packets, I think), I opted for the former. So we now prevent MDNS response packets becoming too large (> 9000 bytes) by using conservative upper bounds and creating multi-packet responses if necessary (effectively when there are more than 29 addresses to encode, which effectively means when the local peer has more than 29 listening addresses, as a peer only responds with its own addresses). I'm only just starting out with studying the MDNS specifications, so feel free to set me straight if I'm doing anything nonsensical here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I opted for just skipping addresses that don't fit into a TXT record or contain invalid characters, instead of failing to send a response (which may contain other valid records), thereby logging a warning for the skipped addresses.\r\n\r\nAs

Supersedes https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1863.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAt the moment one can neither get confirmation when a response has been sent on the underlying transport, nor is one aware of response omissions. The latter was originally intended as a feature for support of one-way protocols, which seems like a bad idea in hindsight. The lack of a notification for sent responses may prohibit implementation of some request-response protocols that need to ensure a happens-before relation between sending a response and a subsequent request, besides possible uses for collecting statistics.\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n  * Dropped support for \"one-way\" request-response protocols.\r\n  * New `InboundFailure::ResponseOmission` variant.\r\n  * Removed `InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed` variant.\r\n  * `RequestResponse::send_response()` now returns a `Result`, allowing early detection of failed inbound requests due to timeout or a closed connection.\r\n  * New `RequestResponseEvent::ResponseSent` variant, emitted when the response has been successfully written on the underlying transport connection.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nEven with these changes, there is no _active_ notification for failed inbound requests as a result of connections unexpectedly closing, as is the case for outbound requests. Instead, for pending inbound requests this scenario can be identified, if necessary, either through errors returned on `send_response` or by the absence of both `InboundFailure` and `ResponseSent` events for a particular previously received request. Interest in this situation is not expected to be common and would otherwise require explicitly tracking all inbound requests in the `RequestResponse` behaviour just to actively report `ConnectionClosed` for each pending inbound request in that scenario, which would be a pity. Notably `RequestResponse::send_response` now also synchronously returns an error if the inbound upgrade handling the request has been aborted, due to timeout or closing of the connection, giving more options for graceful error handling for inbound requests. It is also noteworthy that client code that does not call `send_response()` will now necessarily receive a `InboundFailure::ResponseOmission`, so except for the case where a connection closes just after `send_response()` succeeded, client code is usually bound to notice a closed connection already on `send_response()`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This PR does not prohibit (re-)adding `InboundFailure::ConnectionClosed` and dedicated inbound request tracking in the future, and neither would doing so make any changes proposed here obsolete. The above discussion is just to expand on why I think the need for doing so becomes even less likely.\r\n\r\n## Throttled Wrapper Credit Grants\r\n\r\nAs an aside, the `Throttled` wrapper now no longer emits inbound or outbound error events occurring in the context of sending credit requests or responses. This is in addition to not emitting `ResponseSent` events for ACK responses of credit grants. I think the credit requests and responses, including errors, should be completely opaque to the user. If credit messages keep failing, the effect on the public API should merely be that of back-pressure due to running out of credit.", "reactions": {"url":
