\"new listener address\".\r\n\r\nThe `Swarm` now has two new async methods: `next()` and `next_extended()`. The former is the same as calling `Stream::next()` except that `None` is never returned. The latter is the same as `next()` except that it returns a `SwarmEvent`.\r\nAdditionally, polling the `Swarm` no longer returns a `Result`.\r\n\r\nWe can either merge before or after #1328, but this change should be in the CHANGELOG.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1374/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

data being written as well as potentially arithmetic overflow. This is essentially a backport of what was fixed for the `stable-futures` branch [here](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1335#discussion_r355373145). However, instead of removing the optimisation of writing out the entire data in one go, as done there, this just corrects the oversight of not taking `buf.len()` into account when computing `written` in the `io::Write` impl of `LengthDelimitedReader`. The rest of the diff just adds some debug assertions for further clarity.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to removing this kind of optimisation entirely, as it is evidently non-trivial to get right, though I think it should then also be removed from the `io::Write` impl of `Negotiated`, which does the same thing in the context of an owned buffer (and can be used to compare the implementations).",

use stable futures rather than futures 0.1.\r\nThis unlocks the possibility to use async/await, and opens the door for further API refactorings later on.\r\n\r\nThere is one test failure right now, the \"network simultaneous dial\" test, which seems to be caused by the `V1Lazy` upgrade system. This needs to be investigated.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to reviewing, I don't know what everyone's opinion is. While many individual changes to the `stable-futures` branch have already been reviewed, unfortunately most of the changes made early on (notably in `core` and `swarm` haven't). I think most of the reviewing should be straight-forward, as most of the code is a 1:1 port of the old code.\r\n\r\nA few things have changed:\r\n\r\n- `ProtocolsHandler::poll` doesn't return an `Error` anymore. Instead, `ProtocolsHandlerEvent` (the return value of `poll`) has a new `Close` variant, which corresponds to what an error represented before.\r\n- We're using `async-std` for networking, rather than `tokio`. This is for two reasons: this unties us from tokio (async-std futures can be polled with anything, while tokio networking futures can only be polled with tokio), and `async-std` was ready before `tokio` was.\r\n- All the traits that have a `poll` function (i.e. `NetworkBehaviour`, `ProtocolsHandler`, `NodeHandler`) now have a `&mut Context` parameter to reflect the changes in the `Future` trait.\r\n- The `core::upgrade` module was refactored. It now contains a few async methods that allow reading or writing a length-delimited message from a socket.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

order to test the scenario where long mDNS names are encountered, so I'd love to get feedback about unintended consequences: \r\n\r\n* ~~I added the `std` feature for `ring` in the top-level `Cargo.toml`. I wasn't able to build or test within the mdns directory without it (eg: `cd misc/mdns; cargo test` would fail on `ring` error traits).~~\r\n* I added support for creating `PeerId` from the `Identity` multihash. It's in line with the spec, but I'm not familiar with the nuances. This was done so that I could generate long mDNS names for tests.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1287/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Let me know if this bothers you. I might be able to change it with temporary files in the build scripts.\r\n\r\n- I think in the long run we should regenerate the files in our CI on each run to ensure the generated files stay in sync with the `.proto` files.
