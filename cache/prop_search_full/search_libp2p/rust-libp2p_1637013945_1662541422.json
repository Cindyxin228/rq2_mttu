href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/\">Protocol Buffers</a> implementation for the <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust Language</a>. <code>prost</code> generates simple, idiomatic Rust code from <code>proto2</code> and <code>proto3</code> files.</p>\n<p>Relase 0.11 brings a few breaking changes and changes to how prost sources protoc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>prost-build</code> now requires <code>protoc</code> to be available in the path or set\nvia the <code>PROTOC</code> env var.</li>\n<li><code>prost-types</code> now contains new <code>Timestamp</code>/<code>Duration</code> <code>FromStr</code> implementations.</li>\n<li>MSRV bump to <code>1.56</code> and all crates have been moved to edition 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notible changes that are not breaking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>prost-build</code> now has a <code>cleanup-markdown</code> feature for cleaining up\ncode blocks from protobuf files so that they work under rustdoc tests.</li>\n<li><code>prost-build</code> now generates <code>as_str_name</code> for message types.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a

This\r\n`HashSet` is shared with the `TcpListenStream`s via an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`. Given that `Clone` is\r\n`derive`d on `GenTcpConfig`, cloning a `GenTcpConfig`, results in both instances sharing the same\r\nset of listen addresses. This is not intuitive.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is for example error prone in the scenario where one wants to speak both plain DNS/TCP and\r\nWebsockets. Say a user creates the transport in the following way:\r\n\r\n``` Rust\r\nlet transport = {\r\n    let tcp = tcp::TcpConfig::new().nodelay(true).port_reuse(true);\r\n    let dns_tcp = dns::DnsConfig::system(tcp).await?;\r\n    let ws_dns_tcp = websocket::WsConfig::new(dns_tcp.clone());\r\n    dns_tcp.or_transport(ws_dns_tcp)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth `dns_tcp` and `ws_dns_tcp` share the set of listen addresses, given the `dns_tcp.clone()` to\r\ncreate the `ws_dns_tcp`. Thus, with port-reuse, a Websocket dial might reuse a DNS/TCP listening\r\nport instead of a Websocket listening port.\r\n\r\nWith this commit a user is forced to do the below, preventing the above error:\r\n\r\n``` Rust\r\nlet transport = {\r\n    let dns_tcp = dns::DnsConfig::system(tcp::TcpConfig::new().nodelay(true).port_reuse(true)).await?;\r\n    let ws_dns_tcp = websocket::WsConfig::new(\r\n        dns::DnsConfig::system(tcp::TcpConfig::new().nodelay(true).port_reuse(true)).await?,\r\n    );\r\n    dns_tcp.or_transport(ws_dns_tcp)\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please write a summary of your changes and why you made them.-->\r\n\r\n## Links to any relevant issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Reference any related issues.-->\r\nFollow up on https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2670 //CC @pj50\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Change checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a Changelog entry in the appropriate crates and bump the crate versions if needed.
