which implements `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`. The output of the `framed` transport produces and consumes just bytes which correspond to the actual application data in a websocket frame. (See https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1103 for details.)\r\n\r\nThe transport(s) now handle TLS, i.e. they use TLS for `/wss` multi-addresses (See https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1094 for details.)\r\n\r\nI have created a version of the chat example to work with the websocket transport. If you want to try it you can find it here: https://gist.github.com/twittner/1c9ea9fcd538d5e6727cd6bb56c1a43d.\r\n\r\nThe transport uses the not yet published [soketto](https://github.com/paritytech/soketto) crate which is a heavily modified fork of the twist crate. If and when we agree to merge this PR soketto should be published to `crates.io` and the git reference in the `Cargo.toml` of `libp2p-websocket` should be replaced with a proper version number.",

implementation for finding the entries whose keys are closest to some target key in the Kademlia routing table involves copying the keys of all buckets into a new `Vec` which is then sorted based on the\r\ndistances of the entries to the target and turned into an iterator from which only a small number of elements (by default 20) are drawn.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces an iterator for finding the closest keys (or entries) to a target that visits the buckets in the optimal order, based on the information contained in the distance bit-string representing the distance between the local key and the target (introduced in https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1108). I.e. the needed contents of the respectively next bucket are cloned and sorted only as more elements are drawn from the iterator.\r\n\r\nCorrectness is tested against full-table scans.\r\n\r\nBecause there was some overlap between the handling of pending nodes and the newly introduced iterator(s) in the sense that any access to a bucket should check for applicability of pending nodes to bring the bucket up-to-date, and there were a few TODOs left around the pending node handling, I refactored that part and added more tests. In particular, I did the following:\r\n\r\n  * The (internal) bucket API for a single bucket was moved to `kbucket::bucket`, extracting large parts of code formerly directly embedded into the `Entry` API. That improves reuse and testability.\r\n  * The (public) `Entry` API was moved to the `kbucket::entry` sub-module and simplified due to the first point. The `Entry` API now just mediates access to the internal bucket API.\r\n  * The pending node handling reflects the following policy: `The nodes in a bucket are ordered from least-recently connected to most-recently connected`, i.e. a \"connection-oriented\" variant of what is described in the paper.\r\n\r\nDue to refactorings the diffs are a bit large and I suggest the following (bottom-up) order for an effective review:\r\n\r\n  1. The new `kbucket::bucket` module.\r\n  2. The new `kbucket::entry` module.\r\n  3. The new iterator(s) in the `kbucket` module and the new top-level functions `closest` and `closest_keys`, implementing the optimised bucket iteration. [Here is the relevant part in the `kbucket` module](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/7949879f73352b23a9e5e43c0f9fae1d312c2f46/protocols/kad/src/kbucket.rs#L209-L396).\r\n  4. The remaining full diff of the `kbucket` and `behaviour` modules which adopt the rest of the code to the above changes. That should be quick after seeing all the previous changes.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1117/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1101.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses what I believe to be two issues with the current implementation and use of Kademlia's XOR metric:\r\n\r\n  1. The distance is currently equated with the bucket index, i.e. `distance(a,b) - 1` is the index of the bucket into which either peer is put by the other. The result is a metric that is not unidirectional, as defined in the Kademlia paper and, as far as I could see, as it is implemented in e.g. libp2p-go and libp2p-js (see e.g. [here](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kbucket/blob/master/keyspace/xor.go#L21-L44)), which is to interpret the result of the XOR as-is as an integer representing the distance. The bucket index is of course still determined by the distance.\r\n\r\n  2. The current `KBucketsPeerId` trait and its instances compute distances between types with differing bit lengths as well as between types that re-hash all inputs (i.e. `KadHash`) and \"plain\" `PeerId`s or `Multihash`es, or even just between `PeerId`s or `Multihash`es. Such distances are incorrect as per the libp2p spec requirement that all distances be computed over the XOR of the SHA256 hashes of the inputs, be it peer IDs, multihashes, etc. The computed distances can even fall outside of the image of the metric used for the `KBucketsTable` and thus fall in the range of a non-existent bucket. In the latter case, such distances are not currently used as a bucket index - they can only occur temporarily in the context of comparing distances for the purpose of sorting peers - but that still seems very undesirable.\r\n\r\nThese issues are addressed in this PR as follows:\r\n\r\n  * Unidirectionality of the XOR metric is restored by keeping the \"full\" integer representation of the bitwise XOR. The result is an XOR metric as defined in the paper and as computed by other libp2p implementations. This should also open the door to avoiding the  \"full table scan\" when searching for the keys closest to a given key - the ideal order in which to visit the buckets can be computed with the help of the distance bit string, which is something I'd like to try afterwards.\r\n\r\n  * As a simplification and to make it easy to \"do the right thing\", the XOR metric is only defined on an opaque `kbucket::Key` type, partially derived from the current `KadHash`. `KadHash` and `KBucketsPeerId` are removed.\r\n\r\nThese changes do not affect the distribution of keys into buckets, i.e. the same peer ID (as a former `KadHash`) still falls into the same bucket, but restoring unidirectionality means e.g. that lookups for the closest peers for a specific key from different nodes will now converge towards the same set of closest peers, as described in the paper.\r\n\r\nTests for the properties of the XOR metric have been added and some existing tests tweaked.", "reactions": {"url":
