lead to very old messages being re-propagated on networks. \r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the Interval implementation back to `wasm_timer`. This should be sufficient to get gossipsub to work as expected however it was noted that this is not as performant as a straight `tokio::time::Interval`. A future PR should be made that ports the interval to be `tokio` agnostic, yet equally performant and compatible with WASM on NodeJS.", "reactions": {"url":

This is done under the\r\nassumption that noone uses the `Network` abstraction directly, but\r\ninstead everyone always uses it through `Swarm`. Both `Listeners` and\r\n`Pool` are moved from `libp2p-core` into `libp2p-swarm`.

Thus allowing to\r\n  rename `ProtocolsHandler` into `ConnectionHandler`.\r\n- Moving `NetworkBehaviour` and `ProtocolsHandler` into `libp2p-core`,\r\n  having `libp2p-xxx` protocol crates only depend on `libp2p-core` and\r\n  thus allowing general breaking changes to `Swarm` without breaking all\r\n  `libp2p-xxx` crates.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2492/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2492/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2491", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2491/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2491/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2491/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2491", "id": 1127032884, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBSHhDc4yOVJB", "number": 2491, "title": "core/src/: Validate PeerRecord signature matching peer ID", "user": {"login": "mxinden", "id": 7047859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc4NTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden", "html_url": "https://github.com/mxinden", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mxinden/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-02-08T10:00:15Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-09T15:39:03Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-09T15:39:03Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pulls/2491", "html_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2491", "diff_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2491.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2491.patch", "merged_at": "2022-02-09T15:39:03Z"}, "body": "This pull request brings the patches of `v0.42.2` and `v0.41.2` back into `master`.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to @MarcoPolo for finding the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n(Potential) follow up steps:\r\n- Use `thiserror`.\r\n- Revert `pub(crate)` key in `SignedEnvelope`.\r\n- Don't take ownership of `key` in `SignedEnvelope::new`.\r\n- Stress the fact that as a user of `SignedEnvelope` one has to validate that the contained public key is correct.
