added a few improvements to the docker deployment\r\n\r\n- [x] I fixed the `Dockerfile` that was in the `server` folder, some dependencies were missing, and it needs to be in the root folder to be able to install the `oxigraph` crate from the local directory\r\n\r\n- [x] Added a `docker-compose.yml` and `server/nginx.conf` to deploy with nginx authentication on `/update`, it has been mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/issues/88\r\n\r\nIt would be better if authentication was implemented directly in Rust, but in the meantime using a nginx proxy to add authentication only on `/update` can be convenient if someone wants to deploy the SPARQL endpoint publicly\r\n\r\n- [x] Added a GitHub Action workflow that will build and publish the docker image to the GitHub Container registry at `ghcr.io/oxigraph/oxigraph` \r\n\r\nDockerHub now has pull rates limits that can be a pain when working in cluster, and it's convenient to have everything in the same codebase. The workflow will publish every push to the master branch as the `latest` tag, and every new release as the corresponding tag (`v0.1.2` will be published as tag `0.1.2`)\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated the `server/README.md` to reflect the mentioned changes\r\n\r\nAlso, most commands where instructing to use `oxigraph_server load --file my_file.nq --location my_data_storage_directory` but the right command is actually `oxigraph_server --location my_data_storage_directory load --file my_file.nq` so I changed it\r\n\r\n- [x] Added the volumes shared by docker in the `.gitignore`\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any changes you would like to do!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/oxigraph/oxigraph/issues/178/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":
