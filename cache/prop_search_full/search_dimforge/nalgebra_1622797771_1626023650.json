It takes the dimension number as a type-level integer (e.g. `Const<3>`) instead\r\n  of a const-generic. The type `Point<T, const D: usize>` is now an alias for `OPoint`. This changes doesn't affect any\r\n  of the existing code using `Point`. However, it will allow the use `OPoint` in a generic context where the dimension\r\n  cannot be easily expressed as a const-generic (because of the current limitation of const-generics in Rust).\r\n- Several clippy warnings were fixed. This results in some method signature changes (e.g. taking `self` instead of `&self`)\r\n  but this should not have any practical infulances on existing codebase.\r\n- The `Point::new` constructors are no longer const-fn. This is due to some limitations in const-fn\r\n  not allowing custom trait-bounds. Use the `point!` macro instead to build points in const environments.\r\n- `Dynamic::new` and `Unit::new_unchecked` are now const-fn.\r\n- Methods returning `Result<(), ()>` now return `bool` instead.\r\n  \r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fixed a potential unsoundess issue when converting a mutable slice to a `&mut[T]`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/issues/945/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/issues/945/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/issues/944", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/issues/944/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/issues/944/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/issues/944/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/pull/944", "id": 941340775, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg3MjUwNzM4", "number": 944, "title": "import macros from alloc", "user": {"login": "vadixidav", "id": 12789579, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzg5NTc5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12789579?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav", "html_url": "https://github.com/vadixidav", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadixidav/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-07-10T23:37:16Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-11T15:47:52Z", "closed_at": "2021-07-11T15:47:51Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/nalgebra/pulls/944", "html_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/pull/944", "diff_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/pull/944.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/pull/944.patch", "merged_at": "2021-07-11T15:47:51Z"}, "body": "This solves several issues encountered when trying to build with the alloc feature.\r\n\r\nFor one, the alloc feature is stable, and has been since Rust 1.36.0:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nwarning: the feature `alloc` has been stable since 1.36.0 and no longer requires\r\n an attribute to enable\r\n  --> src/lib.rs:90:67\r\n   |\r\n90 | #![cfg_attr(all(feature = \"alloc\", not(feature = \"std\")), feature(alloc))]\r\n   |                                                                   ^^^^^\r\n   |\r\n   = note: `#[warn(stable_features)]` on by default\r\n\r\nwarning: 1 warning emitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondly, this breaks the build on stable:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n ~/g/r/cv \ue0b0 \ue0a0 compilable \ue0b0 cv-optimize \ue0b0 cargo check\r\n    Checking nalgebra v0.27.1\r\nerror[E0554]: `#![feature]` may not be used on the stable release channel\r\n  --> /home/matthieu/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/nalgebra-0.27.1/src/lib.rs:89:59\r\n   |\r\n89 | #![cfg_attr(all(feature = \"alloc\", not(feature = \"std\")), feature(alloc))]\r\n   |                                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also fails to build on nightly with the feature configuration we have in Rust CV:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror: cannot find macro `format` in this scope\r\n  --> C:\\Users\\vadix\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\nalgebra-0.27.1\\src\\base\\vec_storage.rs:70:43\r\n   |\r\n70 |             return Err(Des::Error::custom(format!(\r\n   |                                           ^^^^^^\r\n   |\r\n   = note: consider importing one of these items:\r\n           alloc::format\r\n           std::format\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these issues are solved by this PR.\r\n\r\nWe may also want to add a follow up to test `alloc` feature on stable in CI.

`SliceStorageMut` (the latter gets both). Also, to complement the `From` impls which convert slices to `DVectorSlice` and `DVectorSliceMut`, this PR adds corresponding `From` impls to convert back to the respective slice type.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is essentially a generalization of [`as_mut_slice_unchecked`](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/blob/38add0b00df2bfba89b8e753e7cb16fcf4ae93c3/src/base/matrix_slice.rs#L190-L198). I just noticed https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/pull/905, I'm not sure how this relates to this new functions, but I guess they should be not affected because they consume the respective storage struct entirely.\r\n\r\nThis would implement #920\r\n\r\n_From a consistency point of view, I wonder whether it would make sense to also add an analog method to `VecStorage`._", "reactions": {"url":
