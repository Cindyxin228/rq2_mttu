This visitor is relatively generic and can be used for other cost functions applied to a `BroadPhase`.\r\n\r\nThe `.first_intersection_with_ray()` method passes in the equivalent of a narrow phase as the cost function which finds the smallest `toi` in the tree.\r\n\r\n# What's left:\r\n- There are a few TODO's left in comments that mainly involve traits being more restrictive than I would like. It should be possible to make them more open in the future without a major interface change so maybe not blocking?\r\n- I would like to add a minimum and maximum to the cost function visitor so that it can ignore the values outside the accepted range. I think this should be added as a new members to the visitor struct with default values applied. A new constructor method could be created to set them. Does this actually work without bloating the API too much?\r\n- How optimal is the implementation here? I did a rough benchmark test using an external repo and it seemed to be slightly more efficient with 100 objects or so but it's hard to quantify.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/320/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/320/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/319", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/319/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/319/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/319/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/ncollide/pull/319", "id": 562662988, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzczMjE4ODM0", "number": 319, "title": "Fix point/aabb projection along the x axis when the point is inside of the AABB.", "user": {"login": "sebcrozet", "id": 1734958, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzQ5NTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1734958?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet", "html_url": "https://github.com/sebcrozet", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sebcrozet/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 39696354, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzOTY5NjM1NA==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true, "description": null}, {"id": 1055348959, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDU1MzQ4OTU5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/labels/P-high", "name": "P-high", "color": "eda8ab", "default": false, "description": "High priority"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2020-02-10T16:06:26Z", "updated_at": "2020-02-10T16:20:46Z", "closed_at": "2020-02-10T16:18:05Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/pulls/319", "html_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/ncollide/pull/319", "diff_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/ncollide/pull/319.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/dimforge/ncollide/pull/319.patch", "merged_at": "2020-02-10T16:18:05Z"}, "body": "The projection was wrong in the specific case where:\r\n\r\n- The point is inside of the AABB/Cuboid.\r\n- The projection being performed is non-solid.\r\n- The closest face to the point is the one with normal `-x`.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the computed projection point wrong due to a flipped sign.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/319/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dimforge/ncollide/issues/319/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
