"merged_at": "2022-10-27T18:13:21Z"}, "body": "Hi! First of all, thank you for all the work put into these crates!\r\n\r\nI have faced the issue where a formatted pattern cannot outlive its arguments (same issue raised by #190 and #260)\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to allow it, since the returned `Cow` doesn't seems to be tied to any arguments references.\r\n\r\n_Aside note_\r\nIt was the case before at the time of the issue #190 i.e. https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs/blob/43f1f59534487ca539164a160498138a6ae641b2/fluent-bundle/src/resolve.rs#L146-L148 but current code only return reference to the resource when there is only 1 `TextElement` i.e. https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs/blob/8e17ee622bb98aad2ff2382755633148637fede9/fluent-bundle/src/resolver/pattern.rs#L94-L101\r\n_End of the aside note_\r\n\r\nThe problem is this code doesn't compile:\r\n```rust\r\nuse fluent_bundle::{FluentArgs, FluentBundle, FluentResource};\r\nuse std::borrow::Cow;\r\nuse unic_langid::langid;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let res = FluentResource::try_new(\"greeting = Hello, { $name }\".to_string()).unwrap();\r\n    let en_us = langid!(\"en-US\");\r\n    let mut bundle = FluentBundle::new(vec![en_us]);\r\n    bundle.add_resource(res).unwrap();\r\n\r\n    let result = greeting(\"World!\", &bundle);\r\n    println!(\"{result}\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn greeting<'a, 'b>(name: &'a str, bundle: &'b FluentBundle<FluentResource>) -> Cow<'b, str> {\r\n    let mut errors = vec![];\r\n    let value = bundle.get_message(\"greeting\").unwrap().value().unwrap();\r\n\r\n    let mut args = FluentArgs::new();\r\n    args.set(\"name\", name);\r\n\r\n    bundle.format_pattern(value, Some(&args), &mut errors)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nError:\r\n```\r\nerror[E0623]: lifetime mismatch\r\n  --> src/main.rs:22:5\r\n   |\r\n15 | fn greeting<'a, 'b>(name: &'a str, bundle: &'b FluentBundle<FluentResource>) -> Cow<'b, str> {\r\n   |                           -------                                               ------------\r\n   |                           |\r\n   |                           this parameter and the return type are declared with different lifetimes...\r\n...\r\n22 |     bundle.format_pattern(value, Some(&args), &mut errors)\r\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...but data from `name` is returned here\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the only issues is about lifetimes and this PR is a proposition to fix that.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I'm correct, if you agree with the lifetimes naming and the tests.\r\n\r\nThank again!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFYI I tried to differentiate more lifetimes in `Scope` i.e. `&'bundle FluentBundle` and `ast::Pattern<&'source str>` because theorically they are different lifetimes but it requires too much work because we don't have access to `'source` lifetime from `FluentResource` and it's most of time obfuscated as `R` when referred to.\r\nIt could have been interesting because the `format_pattern` should return `Cow<'source, str>` and could theorically outlives `FluentBundle` but not the `FluentResource`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn format_pattern<'bundle, 'source, 'args>(\r\n   &'bundle self,\r\n   pattern: &'bundle ast::Pattern<&'source str>,\r\n   args: Option<&'args FluentArgs>,\r\n   errors: &mut Vec<FluentError>,\r\n) -> Cow<'source, str>;\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
