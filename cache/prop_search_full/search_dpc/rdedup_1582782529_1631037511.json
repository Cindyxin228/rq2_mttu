descriptive, I opted for panicking when the requested backend isn't enabled.\r\n\r\n**Note: I haven't actually tested the success and failure path of `rdedup_lib::aio::backend_from_url` as I don't

This PR changes this - it only makes some necessary structs and traits visible so anyone can implement a new backend into his own code and use `redup_lib` as it is, only as a dependency.  \r\nAn example how the usage will look like afterward can be seen here: [`RemoteBackend`](https://github.com/jendakol/rbackup2-poc/blob/master/client/src/remote.rs) and [its usage](https://github.com/jendakol/rbackup2-poc/blob/master/client/src/main.rs#L29) (please mind/excuse its PoC status).\r\n\r\nThe API is exposed via some [artificial modules](https://github.com/jendakol/rdedup/blob/84aa1764db6c968c7f7fd63c9c8467a0e9a30616/lib/src/lib.rs#L60). The reason is that exposing them with their real _nestings_ would IMHO look confusing to a newcomer and, on the other hand, refactoring it to follow these artificial modules structure would be much bigger cut to the library - maybe worth it though.
