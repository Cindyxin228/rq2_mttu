but fun/kind of cool bug.\r\n\r\nEvery view state type has an `unmount()` method, which is called to remove it from the view. \r\n\r\nFor typical view types, this means \"remove this from the DOM.\" The initial implementation for `ElementState` just removes that element, because we know that removing an element from the DOM also removes all its children.\r\n\r\nHowever, this created an issue in situations like\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  <Style></Style>\r\n  \"Some text\"\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n`Style` is not actually located \"under\"/as a child of the `<div>` in the DOM: it does have a DOM node to be removed, but it's located in the `<head>`, so removing the `<div>` will not remove it.\r\n\r\nThe naive solution would just be to run `children.unmount()` in the `ElementState::unmount()` implementation. However, this would be a very bad idea: it would change the cost of unmounting a section of the DOM from `O(1)` to `O(n)` where `n` is the size of that section. For example, navigating away from a page to the next page would do a depth-first removal of each DOM node individually, then remove the root node.\r\n\r\nInstead, this PR adds an `unmount_from_parent`, which is called when you are being unmounted because a parent DOM node is unmounting. The default implementation is the same as `unmount()`, so it will run any custom unmount logic. But then there are optimized implementations for actual DOM node types, which do not call any DOM functions, because they know they will be unmounted by the parent being unmounted. This should allow deeply-nested children to call their unmount functions correctly, while not paying the cost of unmounting all the nodes. (And because the view tree is statically typed, the compiler should be able to optimize this reasonably well.)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2834/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2834/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2831", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2831/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2831/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2831/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/pull/2831", "id": 2464604707, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHvzHec54S_l3", "number": 2831, "title": "feat: provide several deprecated functions", "user": {"login": "mondeja", "id": 23049315, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDQ5MzE1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23049315?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja", "html_url": "https://github.com/mondeja", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mondeja/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-08-14T00:48:28Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-14T02:08:49Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-14T01:19:52Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/pulls/2831", "html_url": "https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/pull/2831", "diff_url": "https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/pull/2831.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/pull/2831.patch", "merged_at": "2024-08-14T01:19:52Z"}, "body": "Contributes to #2771.

trailing slash, such as `<A href=\"/item/\">`, during navigation to it, and further testing found additional problems with the initial algorithm which was introduced in #1656 (which was a much appreciated starting point).  Work was done to refactor the `std::iter::zip` call into its own function and extended it to support the initial desired use-case, along with multi-level matching, and includes a decent number of test cases with a fairly exhaustive set of href/location combination (which lead to the discovery of the issue with multi-level matching).  There are some edge-case tests also, though given the nature of that less common interpretation I have not include the ability to allow the configuration of that for the helper function.  I imagine if this is needed a future change can just be a boolean flag to determine the match condition when the final `href_f` fragment is `Some(\"\")` - further details on how this all works are left as comments in the relevant sections of this pull request.\r\n\r\nThis pull request was re-submitted as per discussion at #2744.\r\n\r\nEdit: I might actually go ahead and implement this as a flag with this pull request if needed, since shortly after I wrote that I saw the path on how to actually do this (and came up with the name to the flag).  In any case this additional change will be a separate commit so if it is required to be part of a separate pull request we can have this done easily.", "reactions": {"url":

To preserve the previous signature, its `options` field _could_ be `SendWrapper<Option<web_sys::AddEventListenerOptions>>`. However, I'm a little concerned that could lead to more situations where a `SendWrapper` is invalidly constructed.\r\n\r\nThe alternative approach that I took, `Option<SendWrapper<web_sys::AddEventListenerOptions>>`, does not require a `SendWrapper` construction until the moment its inner JS data is constructed, making it more general. However, it would not be possible to return `&Option<web_sys::AddEventListenerOptions>`.\r\n\r\nI don't have a big-picture view of how `EventDescriptor::options` was commonly used in 0.6, so I'm not sure if this change is problematic. If it's not a viable approach, we can simply wrap the whole option as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAlso, sorry for missing that formatting in #2761!

Since the underlying type is always `Copy`, I think it makes sense to allow easy ergonomic access to `Effect::stop`, even if this may result in `stop` being called more than once. As noted [in this message](https://discord.com/channels/1031524867910148188/1263897766929764363/1269441434222592000), multiple calls to `stop` aren't a correctness problem; they're simply redundant.\r\n\r\nI also provided a single test to ensure it runs properly.

</For>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also allows for destructuring of tuples and structs, as it's just directly embedded in the children function's arguments.\r\n```rust\r\nview! {\r\n    <For\r\n        each=move || data.get()\r\n        key=|n| *n\r\n        // stores the item in each row in a variable named `data`\r\n        let((tup1, tup2)) // note the extra parentheses for destructuring\r\n    >\r\n        <p>{tup1} {tup2}</p>\r\n    </For>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't gone through all the examples and changed the usage as I wasn't sure what you wanted to present as the default.

map, here's what I think was going on:\r\n- `dispose_node` was removing nodeA from the reactive graph, but not running the cleanups.\r\n- The slot in the `slotmap` was reused by nodeB, and nodeB used `on_cleanup`.\r\n- The old cleanups were still there, so, when inserting the new cleanup, the old ones were dropped since the slot is the same but has a higher version.\r\n- The old cleanups contained `Drop` impls that triggered some work, which were triggered [inside `slotmap`](https://github.com/orlp/slotmap/blob/c905b6ced490551476cb7c37778eb8128bdea7ba/src/sparse_secondary.rs#L291).\r\n- If any of the triggered work used `on_cleanup`, we recurse and panic.\r\n\r\nWith this patch I tried to simplify and make it more obvious what cleaning up a node and disposing of it means, hopefully my understanding of what's going on here is correct.\r\n\r\nThe commits are meant to be easy to audit individually, and `refactor` commits are meant to match the original behaviour exactly.\r\n\r\nAnd as always, thank you for `leptos`, it has been great!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leptos-rs/leptos/issues/2639/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

The implementation is a fairly straight forward combination of the streaming bytes and json codecs with two exceptions:\r\n1) The content type is the default streaming type instead of JSON because if the chunks are read as merged chunks they cannot be parsed as valid json\r\n2) When using a custom stream type with `StreamingJson`, this PR requires the bound `Stream<Item=T>` in order to make the `T` type used in the trait implementation. We don't use the bound, but it makes the `T` type constrained. Alternatively, I could add an unused generic to `StreamingJson` or `FromReq`, but I would imagine both of those would effect user code more", "reactions": {"url":

provides islands that reduce the amount of total HTML generated and it's build tool minifies CSS with `lightningcss`, soon will be minifying javascript with `swc`, and it can even precompress these static assets. That last of which I think may be the most important because web assembly compress fairly well and it allows the user to ship their entire app as 1 static binary (with musl). \r\n\r\nSince precompression was added as a feature in `cargo-leptos` I haven't seen it mentioned a whole lot so I wanted to help people see how to use it. I have also seen a couple question about setting up compression in general so I added that too.\r\n\r\nI've updated the `hackernews_islands_axum` example to serve all static assets precompressed with `cargo-leptos` and to dynamically compress the HTML.\r\n\r\nThe type of compression sent will depend on what the client supports.\r\n\r\nThe resulting network usage\r\n\r\n| Asset | No Compression |

the browser or vscode\r\nIt turns out it is possible although there doesn't seem to be much in the way of examples or documentation on getting it to work.\r\n\r\nSo I've put together an example of the counter that also can do debugging.\r\n\r\n  * Readme lists what's needed to get it to work.\r\n  * index.html modified slightly.\r\n  * I've included examples for the .vscode files for this one since it's main focus is on how to get debugging to work easily\r\n\r\nSo far I've only really tried this under the windows environment.", "reactions": {"url":
