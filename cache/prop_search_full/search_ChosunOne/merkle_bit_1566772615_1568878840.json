2019-08-25\n> ### Added\n> - Added support for plugging in custom measurements (eg. processor counters)\n>   into Criterion.rs' measurement and analysis.\n> - Added support for plugging in instrumentation for internal profilers such as\n>   `cpuprofiler` which must be explicitly started and stopped within the profiled\n>   process.\n> - Added the `BenchmarkGroup` type, which supersedes `ParameterizedBenchmark`, `Benchmark`,\n>   `Criterion::bench_functions`, `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs`, and `Criterion::bench`.\n>   `BenchmarkGroup` performs the same function as all of the above, but is cleaner to use and more\n>   powerful and flexible. All of these types/functions are now soft-deprecated (meaning they're\n>   hidden from the documentation and should not be used in new code). They will be fully deprecated\n>   at some point in the 0.3.* series and removed in 0.4.0.\n> - `iter_custom` - a \"timing loop\" that allows the caller to perform their own measurements. This is\n>   useful for complex measurements that don't fit into the usual mode of calling a lambda in a loop.\n> - If the benchmark cannot be completed in approximately the requested measurement time,\n>   Criterion.rs will now print a suggested measurement time and sample size that would work.\n> - Two new fields, `throughput_num` and `throughput_type` have been added to the `raw.csv` file.\n> - Added command-line options to set the defaults for warm-up time, measurement-time, etc.\n> \n> ### Changed\n> - The `raw.csv` file format has been changed slightly. The `sample_time_nanos` field has been split\n>   into `sample_measured_value` and `unit` fields to accommodate custom measurements.\n> - Throughput has been expanded from u32 to u64 to accommodate very large input sizes.\n> \n> ### Fixed\n> - Fixed possible invalid file name error on Windows\n> - Fixed potential case where data for two different benchmarks would be stored in the same directory.\n> \n> ### Removed\n> - Removed the `--measure-only` command-line argument; it was deprecated in favor of `--profile-time`\n>   in 0.2.6.\n> - External program benchmarks have been removed; they were deprecated in 0.2.6. The new \n>   `iter_custom` timing loop can be used as a substitute; see `benches/external_process.rs` for an\n>   example of this.\n> \n> ### Deprecated\n> - The `--test` argument is now deprecated. To test benchmarks, use `cargo test --benches`.\n> \n> ## [0.2.11] - 2019-04-08\n> ### Added\n> - Enabled automatic text-coloring on Windows.\n> \n> ### Fixed\n> - Fixed panic caused by outdated files after benchmark names or types were changed.\n> - Reduced timing overhead of `Criterion::iter_batched/iter_batched_ref`.\n> \n> ## [0.2.10] - 2019-02-09\n> ### Added\n> - Added `iter_batched/iter_batched_ref` timing loops, which allow for setup (like \n></tr></table> ...
