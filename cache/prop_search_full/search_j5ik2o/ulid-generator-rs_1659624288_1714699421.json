Support for `rustc-serialize` will be [soft-destabilized in the next Rust edition](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116016). Removing the feature will not break existing users of the feature; Cargo will just not update dependents that rely on it to newer versions of chrono.\n\nIn chrono 0.4.36 we made an accidental breaking change by switching to `derive(Copy)` for `DateTime` instead of a manual implementation.

In it `LocalResult` was renamed to `MappedLocalTime` to avoid the impression that it is a `Result` type were some of the results are errors. For backwards compatibility a type alias with the old name was added.\n\nAs it turns out there is one case where a type alias behaves differently from the regular enum: you can't import enum variants from a type alias with `use chrono::LocalResult::*`. With 0.4.37 we make the new name `MappedLocalTime` the alias, but keep using it in function signatures and the documentation as much as possible.\n\nSee also the release notes of [chrono 0.4.36](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.36) from yesterday for the yanked release.\n\n### [`v0.4.36`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.36)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.35...v0.4.36)\n\nThis release un-deprecates the methods on `TimeDelta` that were deprecated with the 0.4.35 release because of the churn they are causing for the ecosystem.\n\nNew is the `DateTime::with_time()` method.

The reason is that a timestamp is defined to be in UTC. The `NaiveDateTime` type doesn't know the offset from UTC, so it was technically wrong to have these methods. The alternative is to use the similar methods on the `DateTime<Utc>` type, or from the `TimeZone` trait.\n\n    Converting from `NaiveDateTime` to `DateTime<Utc>` is simple with `.and_utc()`, and in the other direction with `.naive_utc()`.\n\n-   The panicking constructors of `TimeDelta` (the new name of the `Duration` type) are deprecated. This was the last part of chrono that defaulted to panicking on error, dating from before rust 1.0.\n\n-   A nice change is that `NaiveDate` now includes a niche. So now `Option<NaiveDate>`, `Option<NaiveDateTime>` and `Option<DateTime<Tz>>` are the same size as their base types.\n\n-   `format::Numeric` and `format::Fixed` are marked as `non_exhaustive`. This will allow us to improve our formatting and parsing support, and we have reason to believe this breaking change will have little to no impact on users.\n\n### Additions\n\n-   Add `DateTime::{from_timestamp_micros, from_timestamp_nanos}` ([#&#8203;1234](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1234))\n-   Add getters to `Parsed` ([#&#8203;1465](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1465))\n\n### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate timestamp methods on `NaiveDateTime` ([#&#8203;1473](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1473))\n-   Deprecate panicking constructors of `TimeDelta` ([#&#8203;1450](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1450))\n\n### Changes/fixes\n\n-   Use `NonZeroI32` inside `NaiveDate` ([#&#8203;1207](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1207))\n-   Mark `format::Numeric` and `format::Fixed` as `non_exhaustive` ([#&#8203;1430](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1430))\n-   `Parsed` fixes to error values ([#&#8203;1439](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1439))\n-   Use `overflowing_naive_local` in `DateTime::checked_add*` ([#&#8203;1333](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1333))\n-   Do complete range checks in `Parsed::set_*` ([#&#8203;1465](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1465))\n\n### Documentation\n\n-   Rustfmt doctests ([#&#8203;1452](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1452))\n-   Improve docs for crate features ([#&#8203;1455](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1455), thanks [@&#8203;edmorley](https://togithub.com/edmorley))\n-   Add more documentation and examples to `Parsed` ([#&#8203;1439](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1439))\n\n### Internal\n\n-   Refactor `internals` module ([#&#8203;1428](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1428), [#&#8203;1429](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1429), [#&#8203;1431](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1431), [#&#8203;1432](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1432), [#&#8203;1433](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1433), [#&#8203;1438](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1438))\n-   CI: test cross-compiling to `x86_64-unknown-illumos` instead of Solaris ([#&#8203;1437](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1437))\n-   CI: lint Windows target, fix clippy warning ([#&#8203;1441](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1441))\n-   CI: only run `cargo hack check` on Linux ([#&#8203;1442](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1442))\n-   Update windows-bindgen to 0.54 ([#&#8203;1462](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1462), [#&#8203;1483](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1483))\n-   Simplify error value of `parse_internal` ([#&#8203;1459](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1459))\n-   Simplify `SerdeError` ([#&#8203;1458](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1458))\n-   Simplify `NaiveDate::from_isoywd` a bit ([#&#8203;1464](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1464))\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n### [`v0.4.34`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.34)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.33...v0.4.34)\n\n### Notable changes\n\n-   In chrono 0.4.34 we finished the work to make all methods const where doing so is supported by rust 1.61.\n-   We renamed the `Duration` type to `TimeDelta`. This removes the confusion between chrono's type and the later `Duration` type in the standard library. It will remain available under the old name as a type alias for compatibility.\n-   The Windows implementation of `Local` is rewritten. The new version avoids panics when the date is outside of the range supported by windows (the years 1601 to 30828), and gives more accurate results during DST transitions.\n-   The `Display` format of `TimeDelta` is modified to conform better to ISO 8601. Previously it converted all values greater than 24 hours to a value with days. This is not correct, as doing so changes the duration from an 'accurate' to a 'nominal' representation to use ISO 8601 terms.\n\n### Fixes\n\n-   Add missing range check in `TimeDelta::milliseconds`

[@&#8203;danwilliams](https://togithub.com/danwilliams))\n\n### [`v0.4.32`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.32)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.31...v0.4.32)\n\nIn this release we shipped part of the effort to reduce the number of methods that could unexpectedly panic, notably for the `DateTime` and `Duration` types.\n\nChrono internally stores the value of a `DateTime` in UTC, and transparently converts it to the local value as required. For example adding a second to a `DateTime` needs to be done in UTC to get the correct result, but adding a day needs to be done in local time to be correct. What happens when the value is near the edge of the representable range, and the implicit conversions pushes it beyond the representable range? *Many* methods could panic on such inputs, including formatting the value for `Debug` output.\n\nIn chrono 0.4.32 the range of `NaiveDate`, `NaiveDateTime` and `DateTime` is made slightly smaller. This allows us to always do the implicit conversion, and in many cases return the expected result. Specifically the range is now from January 1, -262144 until December 31, 262143, one year less on both sides than before. We expect this may trip up tests if you hardcoded the `MIN` and `MAX` dates.\n\n`Duration` had a similar issue. The range of this type was pretty arbitrary picked to match the range of an `i64` in milliseconds. Negating an `i64::MIN` pushes a value out of range, and in the same way negating `Duration::MIN` could push it out of our defined range and cause a panic. This turns out to be somewhat common and hidden behind many layers of abstraction. We adjusted the type to have a minimum value of `-Duration::MAX` instead and prevent the panic case.\n\nOther highlights:\n\n-   `Duration` gained new fallible initialization methods.\n-   Better support for `rkyv`.\n-   Most methods on `NaiveDateTime` are now const.\n-   We had to bump our MSRV to 1.61 to keep building with our dependencies. This will also allow us to make more methods on `DateTime` const in a future release.\n\nComplete list of changes:\n\n#### Fixes\n\n-   Fix panic in `TimeZone::from_local_datetime`

[`v0.4.30`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.30)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.29...v0.4.30)\n\nIn this release, we have decided to swap out the `chrono::Duration` type (which has been a re-export of time 0.1 `Duration` type) with our own definition, which exposes a strict superset of the `time::Duration` API. This helps avoid warnings about the [CVE-2020-26235] and [RUSTSEC-2020-0071] advisories for downstream users and allows us to improve the `Duration` API going forward.\n\nWhile this is technically a SemVer-breaking change, we expect the risk of downstream users experiencing actual incompatibility to be exceedingly limited (see [our analysis](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1095#issuecomment-1571716955) of public code using a crater-like experiment), and not enough justification for the large ecosystem churn of a 0.5 release. If you have any feedback on these changes, please let us know in [#&#8203;1268](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1268).\n\n##### Additions\n\n-   Add `NaiveDate::leap_year` ([#&#8203;1261](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1261))\n\n##### Documentation\n\n-   Update main documentation from README ([#&#8203;1260](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1260), thanks [@&#8203;Stygmates](https://togithub.com/Stygmates))\n-   Add history of relation between chrono and time 0.1 to documentation ([https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1264](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1264), [https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1266](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1266))\n-   Clarify `Timelike::num_seconds_from_midnight` is a simple mapping ([#&#8203;1255](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1255))\n\n##### Relation between chrono and time 0.1\n\nRust first had a `time` module added to `std` in its 0.7 release. It later moved to `libextra`, and then to a `libtime` library shipped alongside the standard library. In 2014 work on chrono started in order to provide a full-featured date and time library in Rust. Some improvements from chrono made it into the standard library; notably, `chrono::Duration` was included as `std::time::Duration` ([rust#15934]) in 2014.\n\nIn preparation of Rust 1.0 at the end of 2014 `libtime` was moved out of the Rust distro and into the `time` crate to eventually be redesigned ([rust#18832], [rust#18858]), like the `num` and `rand` crates. Of course chrono kept its dependency on this `time` crate. `time` started re-exporting `std::time::Duration` during this period. Later, the standard library was changed to have a more limited unsigned `Duration` type ([rust#24920], [RFC 1040]), while the `time` crate kept the full functionality with `time::Duration`. `time::Duration` had been a part of chrono's public API.\n\nBy 2016 `time` 0.1 lived under the `rust-lang-deprecated` organisation and was not actively maintained ([time#136]). chrono absorbed the platform functionality and `Duration` type of the `time` crate in [chrono#478] (the work started in [chrono#286]). In order to preserve compatibility with downstream crates depending on `time` and `chrono` sharing a `Duration` type, chrono kept depending on time 0.1. chrono offered the option to opt out of the `time` dependency by disabling the `oldtime` feature (swapping it out for an effectively similar chrono type). In 2019, [@&#8203;jhpratt](https://togithub.com/jhpratt) took over maintenance on the `time` crate and released what amounts to a new crate as `time` 0.2.\n\n[rust#15934]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/15934\n\n[rust#18832]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/18832#issuecomment-62448221\n\n[rust#18858]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/18858\n\n[rust#24920]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/24920\n\n[RFC 1040]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1040-duration-reform.html\n\n[time#136]: https://togithub.com/time-rs/time/issues/136\n\n[chrono#286]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/286\n\n[chrono#478]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/478\n\n##### Security advisories\n\nIn November of 2020 [CVE-2020-26235] and [RUSTSEC-2020-0071] were opened against the `time` crate. [@&#8203;quininer](https://togithub.com/quininer) had found that calls to `localtime_r` may be unsound ([chrono#499]). Eventually, almost a year later, this was also made into a security advisory against chrono as [RUSTSEC-2020-0159], which had platform code similar to `time`.\n\nOn Unix-like systems a process is given a timezone id or description via the `TZ` environment variable. We need this timezone data to calculate the current local time from a value that is in UTC, such as the time from the system clock. `time` 0.1 and chrono used the POSIX function `localtime_r` to do the conversion to local time, which reads the `TZ` variable.\n\nRust assumes the environment to be writable and uses locks to access it from multiple threads. Some other programming languages and libraries use similar locking strategies, but these are typically not shared across languages. More importantly, POSIX declares modifying the environment in a multi-threaded process as unsafe, and `getenv` in libc can't be changed to take a lock because it returns a pointer to the data (see [rust#27970] for more discussion).\n\nSince version 4.20 chrono no longer uses `localtime_r`, instead using Rust code to query the timezone (from the `TZ` variable or via `iana-time-zone` as a fallback) and work with data from the system timezone database directly. The code for this was forked from the [tz-rs crate] by [@&#8203;x-hgg-x](https://togithub.com/x-hgg-x). As such, chrono now respects the Rust lock when reading the `TZ` environment variable. In general, code should avoid modifying the environment.\n\n[CVE-2020-26235]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26235\n\n[RUSTSEC-2020-0071]: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0071\n\n[chrono#499]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/499\n\n[RUSTSEC-2020-0159]: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159.html\n\n[rust#27970]: https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27970\n\n[chrono#677]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/677\n\n[tz-rs crate]: https://crates.io/crates/tz-rs\n\n##### Removing time 0.1\n\nBecause time 0.1 has been unmaintained for years, however, the security advisory mentioned above has not been addressed. While chrono maintainers were careful not to break backwards compatibility with the `time::Duration` type, there has been a long stream of issues from users inquiring about the time 0.1 dependency with the vulnerability. We investigated the potential breakage of removing the time 0.1 dependency in [chrono#1095] using a crater-like experiment and determined that the potential for breaking (public) dependencies is very low. We reached out to those few crates that did still depend on compatibility with time 0.1.\n\nAs such, for chrono 0.4.30 we have decided to swap out the time 0.1 `Duration` implementation for a local one that will offer a strict superset of the existing API going forward. This will prevent most downstream users from being affected by the security vulnerability in time 0.1 while minimizing the ecosystem impact of semver-incompatible version churn.\n\n[chrono#1095]: https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/1095\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n### [`v0.4.29`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.28...v0.4.29)\n\nThis release fixes a panic introduced in chrono 0.4.27 in `FromStr<DateTime<Utc>>` ([#&#8203;1253](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1253)).\n\nChrono now has a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/sXpav4PS7M).\n\n##### Fixes\n\n-   Fix arbitrary string slicing in `parse_rfc3339_relaxed` ([#&#8203;1254](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1254))\n\n##### Deprecations\n\n-   Deprecate `TimeZone::datetime_from_str` ([#&#8203;1251](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1251))\n\n##### Documentation\n\n-   Correct documentation for `FromStr` for `Weekday` and `Month` ([#&#8203;1226](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1226), thanks [@&#8203;wfraser](https://togithub.com/wfraser))\n\n##### Internal improvements\n\n-   Revert \"add test_issue\\_866\" ([#&#8203;1238](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1238))\n-   CI: run tests on `i686` and `wasm32-wasi` ([#&#8203;1237](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1237))\n-   CI: Include doctests for code coverage ([#&#8203;1248](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1248))\n-   Move benchmarks to a separate crate ([#&#8203;1243](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1243))\n    This allows us to upgrade the criterion dependency to 5.1 without changing our MSRV.\n-   Add Discord link to README ([#&#8203;1240](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1240), backported in [#&#8203;1256](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1256))\n\nThanks to all contributors on behalf of the chrono team, [@&#8203;djc](https://togithub.com/djc) and [@&#8203;pitdicker](https://togithub.com/pitdicker)!\n\n### [`v0.4.28`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.28)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.27...v0.4.28)\n\nThis release fixes a test failure on 32-bit targets introduced with 0.4.27, see [https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1234](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1234).\n\n### [`v0.4.27`](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/releases/tag/v0.4.27)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chronotope/chrono/compare/v0.4.26...v0.4.27)\n\nThis release bumps the MSRV from 1.56 to 1.57.

Renovate](https://app.renovatebot.com/images/banner.svg)](https://renovatebot.com)\n\nThis PR contains the following updates:\n\n| Package | Type | Update | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) ([source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)) | dev-dependencies | minor | `0.3` -> `0.4` |\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>bheisler/criterion.rs</summary>\n\n### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040---2022-09-10)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.6...0.4.0)\n\n##### Removed\n\n-   The `Criterion::can_plot` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench_functions` function has been removed.\n-   The `Criterion::bench` function has been removed.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   HTML report hidden behind non-default feature flag: 'html_reports'\n-   Standalone support (ie without cargo-criterion) feature flag: 'cargo_bench_support'\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.57\n-   `rayon` and `plotters` are optional (and default) dependencies.\n-   Status messages ('warming up', 'analyzing', etc) are printed to stderr, benchmark results are printed to stdout.\n-   Accept subsecond durations for `--warm-up-time`, `--measurement-time` and `--profile-time`.\n-   Replaced serde_cbor with ciborium because the former is no longer maintained.\n-   Upgrade clap to v3 and regex to v1.5.\n\n##### Added\n\n-   A `--discard-baseline` flag for discarding rather than saving benchmark results.\n-   Formal support for benchmarking code compiled to web-assembly.\n-   A `--quiet` flag for printing just a single line per benchmark.\n-   A `Throughput::BytesDecimal` option for measuring throughput in bytes but printing them using\n    decimal units like kilobytes instead of binary units like kibibytes.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   When using `bench_with_input`, the input parameter will now be passed through `black_box` before\n    passing it to the benchmark.\n\n### [`v0.3.6`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;036---2022-07-06)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.5...0.3.6)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.49\n-   Symbol for microseconds changed from ASCII 'us' to unicode '\u00b5s'\n-   Documentation fixes\n-   Clippy fixes\n\n### [`v0.3.5`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;035---2021-07-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.4...0.3.5)\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Corrected `Criterion.toml` in the book.\n-   Corrected configuration typo in the book.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   Bump plotters dependency to always include a bug-fix.\n-   MSRV bumped to 1.46.\n\n### [`v0.3.4`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;034---2021-01-24)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.3...0.3.4)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added support for benchmarking async functions\n-   Added `with_output_color` for enabling or disabling CLI output coloring programmatically.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Criterion.rs will now give a clear error message in case of benchmarks that take zero time.\n-   Added some extra code to ensure that every sample has at least one iteration.\n-   Added a notice to the `--help` output regarding \"unrecognized option\" errors.\n-   Increased opacity on violin charts.\n-   Fixed violin chart X axis not starting at zero in the plotters backend.\n-   Criterion.rs will now automatically detect the right output directory.\n\n##### Deprecated\n\n-   `Criterion::can_plot` is no longer useful and is deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0.\n-   `Benchmark` and `ParameterizedBenchmark` were already hidden from documentation, but are now\n    formally deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0. Callers should use `BenchmarkGroup` instead.\n-   `Criterion::bench_function_over_inputs`, `Criterion::bench_functions`, and `Criterion::bench` were\n    already hidden from documentation, but are now formally deprecated pending deletion in 0.4.0.\n    Callers should use `BenchmarkGroup` instead.\n-   Three new optional features have been added; \"html_reports\", \"csv_output\" and\n    \"cargo_bench_support\". These features currently do nothing except disable a warning message at\n    runtime, but in version 0.4.0 they will be used to enable HTML report generation, CSV file\n    generation, and the ability to run in cargo-bench (as opposed to [cargo-criterion]).\n    \"cargo_bench_support\" is enabled by default, but \"html_reports\" and \"csv_output\"\n    are not. If you use Criterion.rs' HTML reports, it is recommended to switch to [cargo-criterion].\n    If you use CSV output, it is recommended to switch to [cargo-criterion] and use the\n    `--message-format=json` option for machine-readable output instead. A warning message will be\n    printed at the start of benchmark runs which do not have \"html_reports\" or \"cargo_bench_support\"\n    enabled, but because CSV output is not widely used it has no warning.\n\n[cargo-criterion]: https://togithub.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion\n\n### [`v0.3.3`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;033---2020-06-29)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.2...0.3.3)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `CRITERION_HOME` environment variable to set the directory for Criterion to store\n    its results and charts in.\n-   Added support for \\[cargo-criterion]. The long-term goal here is to remove code from Criterion-rs\n    itself to improve compile times, as well as to add features to `cargo-criterion` that are\n    difficult to implement in Criterion-rs.\n-   Add sampling mode option for benchmarks. This allows the user to change how Criterion.rs chooses\n    the iteration counts in each sample. By default, nothing will change for most benchmarks, but\n    very slow benchmarks will now run fewer iterations to fit in the desired number of samples.\n    This affects the statistics and plots generated.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The serialization format for some of the files has changed. This may cause your first benchmark\n    run after updating to produce errors, but they're harmless and will go away after running the\n    benchmarks once.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed a bug where the current measurement was not shown on the relative regression plot.\n-   Fixed rare panic in the plotters backend.\n-   Panic with a clear error message (rather than panicking messily later on) when the user sets the\n    group or function name to the empty string.\n-   Escape single quotes in benchmark names when generating Gnuplot scripts.\n\n### [`v0.3.2`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;032---2020-04-26)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.1...0.3.2)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added `?Sized` bound to benchmark parameter types, which allows dynamically sized types like\n    `&str` and `&[T]` to be used as benchmark parameters.\n-   Added the `--output-format <format>` command-line option. If `--output-format bencher` is passed,\n    Criterion.rs will print its measurements in a format similar to that used by the `bencher` crate\n    or unstable `libtest` benchmarks, and using similar statistical measurements as well. Though this\n    provides less information than the default format, it may be useful for supporting tools which\n    parse this output format.\n-   Added `--nocapture` argument. This argument does nothing, but prevents Criterion.rs from exiting\n    when running tests or benchmarks and allowing stdout output from other tests.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed panic when environment variables contains non-UTF8 characters.\n-   Fixed panic when `CRITERION_DEBUG` or `CRITERION_TARGET_DIR` environment variables contain\n    non-UTF8 characters.\n\n### [`v0.3.1`](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;031---2020-01-25)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1)\n\n##### Added\n\n-   Added new plotting backend using the `plotters` crate. Implementation generously provided by Hao\n    Hou, author of the `plotters` crate.\n-   Added `--plotting-backend` command-line option to select the plotting backend. The existing\n    gnuplot backend will be used by default when available, and the plotters backend will be used when\n    gnuplot is not available or when requested.\n-   Added `Criterion::plotting_backend()` function to configure the plotting backend in code.\n-   Added `--load-baseline` command-line option to load a baseline for comparison\n    rather than measuring the current code\n-   Benchmark filters can now be regular expressions.\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fixed `fibonacci` functions.\n-   Fixed `#[criterion]` benchmarks ignoring the command-line options.\n-   Fixed incorrect scaling of the violin plots.\n-   Don't print the recommended sample count if it's the same as the configured\n    sample count.\n-   Fix potential panic when `nresamples` is set too low. Also added a warning\n    against setting `nresamples` too low.\n-   Fixed issue where a slow outer closure would cause Criterion.rs to calculate\n    the wrong estimated time and number of iterations in the warm-up phase.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, click this checkbox.\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).
