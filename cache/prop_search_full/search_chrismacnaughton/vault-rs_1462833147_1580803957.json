work of mine. I've been trying to add `AppRole` backend support, among other things. Sorry for the large PR... I can split it up if it's easier.\n\nSummary of the changes:\n- Added `AppRole` backend.\n- Added an \"escape hatch\" `call_endpoint` function. You can see how it works in the AppRole test case. I'm not sure how we can easily support all the different vault API methods, so I tried to write something more generic that would work for ANY endpoint. I'd imagine our API would have functions for the more common things that vault provides and then you could drop down the `endpoint_call` fn if it's not supported, this would help support the use case mentioned in #7. Note, I didn't implement the `LIST` http verb, since I didn't test it / have a use case for it. Open to feedback here.\n- Added a CHANGELOG, similar to vault. Thought it may be a good idea. I was just checking their 0.6.2 release notes and they have more breaking changes already for AppRole (although we weren't impacted), but they've already deprecated `cubbyhole/response` so I needed to fix that as well. It would be good for users of the library to know what the breaking changes are in this one as well.\n- Used constants where appropriate in the test cases.\n- A fix for `WrapInfo::wrapped_accessor`; I didn't read the vault go code carefully enough before, this an optional field. \n- Mentioned `AppId` backend is deprecated.\n\nOne big question though, as evidenced by travis failures...\n- How do we want to handle vault breaking changes? In 0.6.1, `request_id` field was added to all `VaultResponse`s. How do we want to handle that for testing in travis and in general for library users? It's a required field in 0.6.1, but is missing in all below versions. We could add feature flags as discussed in #6, but I worry that will become a maintenance burden as more breaking changes come in from vault. For example, with `request_id`, we'd need to make two different versions of the `VaultResponse` struct, one with a flag for `gte_vault_0.6.1` and one for `lt_vault_0.6.1`. I feel like things like this would get messy. Maybe we could just have a table and list which vault versions are known to work with which `vault-rs` versions?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/13/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/13/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/11", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/11/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/11/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/11/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/pull/11", "id": 178458787, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODYyMzg3NjE=", "number": 11, "title": "Remove unused lifetime detected by Clippy", "user": {"login": "emk", "id": 36963, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTYz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36963?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk", "html_url": "https://github.com/emk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emk/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2016-09-21T20:49:45Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-22T13:02:00Z", "closed_at": "2016-09-22T13:02:00Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/pulls/11", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/pull/11", "diff_url": "https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/pull/11.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/pull/11.patch", "merged_at": "2016-09-22T13:02:00Z"}, "body": "(This is a low-priority fix to one of my recent PRs.

This allows us to enable the test case for `revoke`!\n2. Token creating has a long and ever-growing list of parameters.  To accomomdate this, I define a `TokenOptions` struct that works as a builder type. Users ceate a new `TokenOptions` struct, and then call a series of chained methods to set individual options.  This is a reasonably common Rust pattern.\n3. The `TokenOptions` builder methods make fairly aggressive use of `Into`, allowing you to pass in `&str`, `String`, etc.  This is similar to `std::process::Command`.\n4. For consistency, I use the existing `VaultDuration` type to specify TTLs when creating a new token.  But I allow for improved API ergonomics by accepting `Into<VaultDuration>`, so that we could accept `std::time::Duration`, `chrono::Duration` or even just bare seconds by defining appropriate `From<T>` implementations for `VaultDuration`.\n5. I include an an API change to `revoke` that (a) removes the need to declare `let mut client`, and (b) prevents the user from accessing a client that they've already revoked.\n6. I also remove a bunch of unnecessary `mut` declarations.\n\nAs always, your feedback is welcome!\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/10/reactions",

you for suggesting that I submit a PR! This PR contains a number of related changes, but each patch makes one, discrete change, and each patch has an explanation of why that change was made in the commit message. So it should be possible to step through the individual patches when reviewing.\n\nThis PR includes implementations of two-thirds of the APIs proposed in #5, including:\n- Renewing arbitrary auth tokens (using `renew_token`), not just the client's own token (using `renew`). It's important to keep the existing API separate and not reimplement it terms of `renew/$TOKEN`, because some tokens have access to `renew-self` but not `renew/$TOKEN`.\n- Listing the policies supported by vault. This normally requires `root` permission, but can be enabled using `sudo` policies if you're clever.\n\n**Not yet implemented** in this PR:\n- Creating new tokens. This API will require a lot of optional parameters, which we'll probably want to pass using a `Builder`-style struct. I'll work on this in the coming days.\n\nAlso included in this PR:\n- Some minor updates and notes to help support Vault 0.6.1, and to make it easier for people to test against it. One of these changes **breaks API compatibility for the `Auth` struct**, so you may need to bump semver when you make a release.\n- A bug fix for several existing APIs that I noticed while working on the new features. I've added doc tests for all the APIs that had this bug.\n\nPlease feel free to suggest changes and improvements to this patch! And thank you for taking the time to review it.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMacNaughton/vault-rs/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,
