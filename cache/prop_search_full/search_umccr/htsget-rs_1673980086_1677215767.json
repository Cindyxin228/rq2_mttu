\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors `htsget-tests` to avoid a circular dependency with `htsget-search` and `htsget-http`.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n* Use generic types in `http-tests` to avoid using the structs in `htsget-search` and `htsget-http`.\r\n* Specify expected responses using `serde_json` [`Value`](https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/value/enum.Value.html). This also probably makes the tests more robust as they no longer dependent on the implementation of the `htsget-http` structs.\r\n* Move `CertificateKeyPair` to config to avoid repeating the logic in `htsget-tests` and simplifying logic in `htsget-search`. This is a breaking change as it removes the `TryFrom<DataServerConfig> for HttpTicketFormatter` implementation.

copy of https://github.com/umccr/infrastructure/blob/master/cdk/apps/htsget/htsget/goserver.py. It changes the deploy to use a HTTP proxy integration rather than a REST proxy integration, with added CORS, domain names, and JWT authorization.\r\n\r\n### Still to do\r\nThis PR is ready to be merge. These points can be addressed in other issues/PRs.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the binary deployed on prod is built via `cargo build --release` (avoid slow default debug builds).\r\n- [ ] Link this to the https://github.com/umccr/infrastructure/tree/master/cdk/apps/htsget docs.\r\n~~- [x] Need to allow arbitrary URLs in the RegexResolver so that sources from anywhere can be used, similar to the htsget-refserver [sources](https://github.com/umccr/infrastructure/blob/91cd07068253ff2121d8c30cbc24e47ddd4786e0/cdk/apps/htsget/config/dev.json#L63-L64). See #134.~~\r\n\r\n### Done\r\n- [x]  Clean up the configuration a bit as it is not as user friendly as I'd like.\r\n- [x] Should the lambda function be run from a VPC in some way? Is there any benefit to this? E.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc-endpoints.html.
