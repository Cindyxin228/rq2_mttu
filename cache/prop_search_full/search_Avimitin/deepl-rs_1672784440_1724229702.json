I recently encountered an issue while using the try_from() method in the Lang enum from the deepl crate. It appears that the error type LangConvertError is not currently exported with the public interface.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I propose a simple modification to include the export of LangConvertError in the try_from() method. This change would enhance the crate's usability by allowing users to handle conversion errors more effectively.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback or if there's anything else I can do to help with this contribution.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Avimitin/deepl-rs/issues/20/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":
