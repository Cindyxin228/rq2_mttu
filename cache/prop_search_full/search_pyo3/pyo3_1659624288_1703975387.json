setup.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits `PyTypeInfo` into three traits:\r\n - `HasPyGilRef`, which can be removed in the near future when we get rid of the GIL refs, but will be useful in the short term. It defines the `AsRefTarget` associated type.\r\n - `PyTypeCheck`, which is used for types like `PyIterator`, `PySequence`, and `PyMapping`, as these can't implement `PyTypeInfo` as they don't have concrete type objects.\r\n - `PyTypeInfo`, which retains its existing API.\r\n\r\nThis then removes PyO3's internal dependency on `PyTryFrom`:\r\n- `PyAny::downcast()` and `PyAnyMethods::downcast` use `PyTypeCheck`.\r\n- `PyAny::downcast_exact()` and `PyAnyMethods::downcast_exact` to use `PyTypeInfo`.\r\n- `PyAny::downcast_unchecked()` uses `HasPyGilRef`. (`PyAnyMethods::downcast_unchecked` needs no helper trait.)\r\n\r\nFrom my experience playing around with #3382, e.g. in #3531, having this adjustment makes it much easier to work with `PyIterator`, `PySequence`, and `PyMapping` in code which is migrating between the two APIs.

https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3535#discussion_r1375187351\r\n\r\nI played around with a few different designs of how to abstract out some of the repeated logic from the FFI calls, such as the second commit I pushed to that PR.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I settled on adding a pair of crate-private extension traits, `impl FfiPtrExt *mut ffi::PyObject` and `impl PyResultExt for PyResult<Py2<'_, PyAny>>`. (These traits could be made public in the future if we wanted, but that's not a question I want to cover right now.)\r\n\r\nIt's best to see how these traits play out for example with the implementation of `repr()`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    fn repr(&self) -> PyResult<Py2<'py, PyString>> {\r\n        unsafe {\r\n            ffi::PyObject_Repr(self.as_ptr())\r\n                .assume_owned_or_ffi_error(self.py())  // *mut ffi::PyObject -> PyResult<Py2<'py, PyAny>>\r\n                .downcast_into_unchecked()  // PyResult<Py2<'py, PyAny>> -> PyResult<Py2<'py, PyString>>\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall, I like how this reads top-to-bottom, unlike the previous implementations where we often had `py.from_owned_ptr()` wrapping the ffi call. I also wanted to keep the downcast explicit, especially unchecked downcasts, because those are assumptions on the underlying ffi call and it makes it easier to audit the implementation by keeping it all explicit.\r\n\r\nOf the iterations I tried, this also was a reasonable fit for code size / verbosity without being either too short and magical or too long and complex.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy to bikeshed names, these seemed to work for me though I'm sure there are better names out there.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/issues/3572/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/issues/3572/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/issues/3570", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/issues/3570/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/issues/3570/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/issues/3570/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3570", "id": 1987738215, "node_id": "PR_kwDOBW7cUs5fJap3", "number": 3570, "title": "docs: fix missing char conversion", "user": {"login": "subygan", "id": 17567938, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3OTM4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567938?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan", "html_url": "https://github.com/subygan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/subygan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-11-10T14:27:52Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-15T01:47:28Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-15T01:47:28Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyO3/pyo3/pulls/3570", "html_url": "https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3570", "diff_url": "https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3570.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/3570.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-15T01:47:28Z"}, "body": "Thank you for contributing to PyO3!\r\n\r\nBy submitting these contributions you agree for them to be dual-licensed under PyO3's [MIT OR Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3#license).\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding the following to your pull request:\r\n - an entry for this PR in newsfragments - see [https://pyo3.rs/main/contributing.html#documenting-changes]\r\n   - or start the PR title with `docs:` if this is a docs-only change to skip the check\r\n - docs to all new functions and / or detail in the guide\r\n - tests for all new or changed functions\r\n\r\nPyO3's CI pipeline will check your pull request.
