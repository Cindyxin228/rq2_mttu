After the dust settles here, we will integrate each PR into `develop`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n * `HasSqlType<T>: Database` is now `T: Type<Database>` to mirror `Encode` and `Decode`\r\n * `Row` is now `Row<'c>` where `'c` is bound to the lifetime of the Connection where the Row came from\r\n * Introduce a `Cursor` type that is now returned from `Query::fetch()`; this is simply a `futures::Stream` where the `Item` type is a higher-ranked trait bound so we can introduce a lifetime per iteration of the stream. Most usages should remain the same.\r\n * `Executor` is now implemented for `&mut Connection` and `&Pool` so hacks like `&mut &Pool` are no longer needed\r\n * Queries from the database are now zero-copy and no allocation beyond a shared read buffer for the TCP stream ( in other words, no per-query allocation )\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n - [x] TLS on Postgres is still unimplemented in the new protocol implementation (all the same code is there, just needs tied together)\r\n - [x] Simple queries on postgres that return results\r\n - [x] Macros are broken ( cue summoning the amazing @abonander )\r\n - [x] Re-add support for query_as (merge old QueryAs with Query)\r\n - [x] Support for MySQL ( I understand Postgres a lot more so it was easier for me to experiment in Postgres, but the same concepts should transfer to MySQL  )\r\n - [x] Postgres / UUID / Text\r\n - [x] Postgres / Chrono / Text\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/111/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 5, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/111/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/109", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/109/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/109/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/109/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/pull/109", "id": 562095237, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzcyNzcwOTAw", "number": 109, "title": "Fix #105, allow trailing commas in query macros", "user": {"login": "tim-harding", "id": 13814470, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE0NDcw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13814470?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding", "html_url": "https://github.com/tim-harding", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tim-harding/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2020-02-08T23:46:48Z", "updated_at": "2020-02-21T06:41:17Z", "closed_at": "2020-02-21T05:48:39Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/pulls/109", "html_url": "https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/pull/109", "diff_url": "https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/pull/109.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/pull/109.patch", "merged_at": "2020-02-21T05:48:39Z"}, "body": "Fixes #105 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/109/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/109/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
