a dependency, a developer may not be aware that another crate is using the same dependency, resulting in the introduction of multiple versions of the same dependency.\r\n- When updating a dependency in the workspace, it becomes immediately clear if it has any effects on the rest of the workspace.  \r\n- Tests and crates should always be locked to the same versions of dependencies as that may result in tests passing while the code itself uses alternate versions of dependencies (perhaps a bit far-fetched but certainly can be the case).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Updating to this branch may result in compilation errors, they can be resolved by running `rm -rf target` (`cargo clean` may not resolve them)\r\n- I initially updated `prost`, `tonic`, and `tonic-build` to the latest versions but while they work, these updates result in use of deprecated functions that break lints.  I've added a note in the `Cargo.toml` that these 3 crates should be updated simultaneously. cc @tiram88 \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Updated all dependencies to the latest published versions with exceptions of a few that cause either build or unit test failures\r\n- Crates that were not updated have been marked with `TODO`\r\n- Migrated all versioned dependencies from sub-crates to the workspace `Cargo.toml`\r\n- Sorted all dependencies alphabetically (makes it easier to see what is where)\r\n- Locked all crates to full versions (having major only or major+minor versions without patch allows for dependency code injections as well as changes in the dependency behavior. This is a project security consideration. It is partially mitigated by `Cargo.lock` but the lockfile does get occasionally refreshed).\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/305/reactions",

allocation of file descriptors. The feature has been added in a new library named \"fd_budget_pool\".\r\n\r\nThe implementation uses atomic operations to keep track of acquired file descriptors and ensures that the total number of acquired descriptors never exceeds a system-specific limit. A FDGuard structure was introduced to automatically release the acquired file descriptors when they are no longer in use. The ordering of atomic operations is marked as 'to do' for later optimization considerations. The get_limit function will check the system and determine the maximum allowable file descriptors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, tests are written to confirm the correct functioning of the feature. Changes have also been made to Cargo files to include the new library and its dependencies. The ultimate goal of this feature is to prevent system-level issues arising from exhausting file descriptors.", "reactions": {"url":

compatible with Chrome Extension Manifest v3 that forbids the usage of unsafe `Function::new()` and `eval()` functionality, commonly used in WASM bindings).\r\n- Rename `kaspad` library to `kaspad_lib` and `kaspa-cli` to `kaspa_cli_lib` (fix lib/bin naming collisions)\r\n- Introduce wallet enumeration functionality (lists all available local wallets)\r\n- Use precise decimal conversion when parsing KAS strings to SOMPI\r\n- Make decryption failure error messages more user-friendly\r\n- Detach Wallet framework from wRPC (allows the wallet to function against gRPC or RpcCoreService directly)\r\n- Introduce auxiliary `RpcCtl` companion struct to handle RPC connection & disconnection events.\r\n- Update Wallet event names (homogenize event names for Serde / JavaScript API)\r\n- Add versioning to all storable wallet data structures (following MultiSig integration, wallet data format will be frozen/switched to LTS (long-term support), meaning that stored files will be backward-compatible in future releases).\r\n- Expose `RpcCoreService` alongside `Core` (allows for direct control and embedding of the Kaspad daemon)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

The prefix is retained within gRPC protowire conversions, and in parameters needed for p2p comms.  The prefix is currently removed from folder names (can be resurrected during the review).\r\n- `kaspa_consensus_core::network_type` is renamed to `kaspa_consensus_core::network` as it contains `NetworkType` and `NetworkId`\r\n- A new `Network` type is introduced inside of the `network::wasm` module: \r\n`kaspa_consensus_core::network::wasm::Network`. This type is specific to WASM bindings allowing functions to receive either a `NetworkType` or `NetworkId` (it effectively allows passing `NetworkId` where `NetworkType` is required).  \r\nIt contains the following TypeScript signature: \r\n`NetworkType | NetworkId | string`.  \r\nThis simplifies the usage of network ids/types within the JavaScript SDK.\r\n- All current JavaScript examples have been stabilized after the above-mentioned changes (and few other related bugfixes).  JavaScript examples will need another review pass before they are considered production-ready.\r\n- `Mnemonic::toSeed()` has been changed to not require a password\r\n- Additional JavaScript examples have been migrated from `nodejs/refactoring/` to `nodejs/` (namely `mnemonic` and `derivation`)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/251/reactions",

"merged_at": "2023-08-22T19:38:31Z"}, "body": "KOS & CLI - platform-agnostic Rust-based Kaspa wallet framework, custom native shell, and desktop applications.\r\n\r\nThese are various application and framework components built on top of and integrated with the Rusty Kaspa project.\r\n\r\nKOS is a desktop application with a terminal interface, and CLI is a custom shell (same as KOS) that can be run as a native application in a computer terminal or in a server environment.\r\n\r\nThis project is in the early alpha release stages and is being PRed to help test it (as well as help test Rusty Kaspa) with the upcoming `testnet-11` reboot.  It is also being PRed at this stage to prevent code divergence and unify as well as simplify the development process as some components of this stack are beneficial for Kaspa developers and integrators.\r\n\r\nKOS is built on top of multiple components - the core of which is the Rusty Kaspa Wallet framework that is built in Rust and can operate in WASM.  The entire framework is being built as an API that allows direct integration within 3rd-party Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript applications.  KOS is a test environment for this framework.\r\n\r\n`/kos` - an installable desktop application capable of running on Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems (powered by NWJS).\r\n`/cli` - a command-line terminal application capable of running as a native command-line application.\r\n`/wallet/wasm` - a web application, capable of running in a browser environment.\r\n\r\nAll 3 variants are the same application/framework built in Rust on top of the Rusty Kaspa Wallet framework. (Enabled by WASM, the wallet framework is platform and environment agnostic, allowing for this kind of unique unified model)\r\n\r\nThe framework is comprised of the following key components:\r\n\r\n## CLI handlers\r\nCommand-line handlers (implement Handler trait) receive terminal commands and execute internal operations on the framework.  Each instance has a startup and shutdown entrypoints, allowing each module to act as a plugin/service (making it very easy to introduce new or customized existing commands).\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/tree/kos/cli/src/modules\r\n\r\nThe CLI module can be started on its own as a command-line application. CLI also serves as a terminal handler within the KOS and the web wallet.\r\n\r\n## Wallet Runtime\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/tree/kos/wallet/core/src/runtime\r\n\r\nThe wallet runtime module contains structures that can be used by applications to interface with the wallet.  They represent in-memory instances of data structures and allow for different operations on the wallet, accounts, etc., tracking their operational state.\r\n\r\n## Wallet Storage\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/tree/kos/wallet/core/src/storage\r\n\r\nOffers the wallet data storage subsystem.  Runtime components interface with the storage subsystem to store wallet and related data, such as transactions.\r\n\r\nThe wallet storage subsystem is abstracted by a number of storage interface traits\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/blob/kos/wallet/core/src/storage/interface.rs\r\nThese traits include: Private Key Storage, Account Data Storage, Transaction Record Storage\r\n\r\nThe framework implementation uses a \"database access pattern\" when interfacing with these storage traits, making it possible to interface them with an internal or an external database (i.e. allow a systems integrator to provide his own storage backend in Rust or in JavaScript).\r\n\r\nThe built-in storage interface called \"local storage\" offers file-backed storage which falls back on the browser's local storage when the browser environment is detected.\r\n\r\n## UTXO Processing Subsystem\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/tree/kos/wallet/core/src/utxo\r\n\r\nUTXO processing subsystem is comprised of 2 main components: UtxoProcessor and UtxoContext. Both components are designed to work in tandem with the Utxo event notification system offered by the Rusty Kaspa framework.  They aggregate and track the lifetime of incoming UTXOs making them available for generating transactions.\r\n\r\nUtxoProcessor is the main \"coordinator\" while UtxoContext represents an account-like structure (but is designed to be general-purpose, so it does not know anything about \"accounts\", it only operates on sets of addresses).\r\n\r\nEach `runtime::Account` owns UtxoContext and uses it to track UTXO sets that belong to it.\r\n\r\nUtxoContext tracks UTXO maturity as well as offers mature UTXOs as an iterator.\r\n\r\n## Mass Calculator\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/blob/kos/wallet/core/src/tx/mass.rs\r\n\r\nThe mass calculator in the wallet subsystem is refactored to remove the separation between byte size calculations and other variables that affect mass.  You now have functions that only return mass - no other components.  However, these functions break mass down into components such as \"blank transaction\", \"input\", and \"output\" (as well as fees).\r\n\r\nThis allows for a progressive creation of transactions, where you can measure the mass of each input while adding it to a transaction until you reach the transaction maximum.\r\n\r\n## Transaction Generator\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/tree/kos/wallet/core/src/tx/generator\r\n\r\nUTXO Generator sources from a UTXO iterator (such as UtxoContext) and generates transactions.  Transactions are generated progressively by iterating over the UTXO entry iterator and accumulating mass.  If the mass threshold is reached, the current transaction is converted into a \"batch\" (a.k.a. sweep/compound) transaction going to the change address, and the next transaction is then set up for further processing.\r\n\r\nTransaction Generator offers transactions as an Iterator or an async Stream.  \r\n\r\nSo on one side, you have a UTXO iterator intake, and on the other side, you have a transaction stream/iterator that will produce transactions until the desired amount is reached (or various conditions occur).\r\n\r\n### Reasons and limitations of the design:\r\n\r\nWhile the iterator/stream-based approach taken by the UtxoContext and Transaction Generator comes across as quite elegant (at least I think it does), the real reason for this design is constraints imposed by the web environment, where you are not allowed to block execution for extended periods of time or consume large amounts of memory in case of large UTXO sets. Having data processed one transaction at a time and having these transactions incoming as an async stream (or an iterator, which ends up being the same, as long as you can make async calls after each iteration) allows us to pace the execution while retaining the transaction generation context. \r\n\r\nHere is a sample transaction generation process:\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/blob/kos/wallet/core/src/runtime/account.rs#L598-L608\r\n\r\nThe initial design that was attempting to chunk UTXO sets has proven to be ineffective and complex to work with.  (OTOH the current Transaction Generator implementation is also quite complex as it ends up being a large loop accumulating transaction inputs).\r\n\r\n## Events\r\nhttps://github.com/aspectron/rusty-kaspa/blob/kos/wallet/core/src/events.rs\r\n\r\nEvents are emitted by various framework components and provide state updates as well as notifications of transaction activity. This makes wallet and 3rd-party  integration very simple as you can simply submit a transaction and receive activity details from the framework. It reduces the complexity because while you can get access to all information, you no longer need to track UTXOs. When a transaction comes in, you will be notified and you will then be notified when the transaction maturity was reached.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important when the network increases BPS because high-BPS processing will impose different logic for tx confirmation processing and this logic will be implemented within the framework by core developers. (or additional tools will be added to the framework to facilitate this).\r\n\r\n## JS/WASM32 API\r\n\r\nKOS is meant to test-drive the above-mentioned components while we create JS/WASM32 bindings for them.  The existing WASM API is fully functional (RPC + Transaction Primitives), however, transaction creation and signing are currently disabled as this needs additional refactoring.  UtxoContext, UtxoProcessor, and TransactionGenerator will be made available as a part of the WASM32 framework.  MassCalculator has already been exposed.\r\n\r\n## Strategical Considerations\r\n\r\nBoth CLI and KOS have been developed as terminal applications on purpose.  This eliminates the UI/UX considerations (which can be an inhibitor to developers), while allowing any Rust developer very easily integrate and test any functionality on native and web platforms.\r\n\r\n3rd-party integrations are meant to capitalize on the framework by integrating with it and using its components for various purposes. Every component of the framework is meant to function in isolation.  I.e. they are not directly dependent on one another. You can use UtxoProcessor and Transaction Generator without the account or wallet structure, providing your own, or use the wallet and accounts, but provide your own storage backend.\r\n\r\nThe wallet is designed around the concept of active and inactive accounts, allowing the wallet to hold thousands of accounts, while on-demand activating or deactivating them. Such integrations would require additional effort, but they are possible from an architectural standpoint.\r\n\r\n## Other notes:\r\n\r\n### General \r\n\r\nThe most important element is that KOS represents a 100% rust-based alternative to KDX capable of running Rusty Kaspa.  Other applications like KNG will effectively be a skin over this functionality. \r\n\r\nA challenging issue, to date, has been that system architects - developers that work on the node have been, to a certain extent isolated from the application layer. As this framework is based on Rust, it allows everyone to use the same tools, breaking the client/server boundaries, so to speak. \r\n\r\n## Policies & Security Considerations\r\n\r\nDue to various technical and security considerations, JavaScript code or toolchain components like NPM are strictly disallowed. The few JavaScript components involved have been embedded directly within Rust and are loaded by the Rust codebase at runtime. \r\n\r\nDown the road, work will be done to reduce crate dependencies as well. In order to build the project, I had to use a variety of crates that are easy to implement in-house. These will be internalized.\r\n\r\n### Wallet Cache\r\n\r\nWhen the wallet is open, it creates an in-memory cache and re-encrypts sensitive data. This allows to minimize storage access.\r\n\r\n### Transaction Storage\r\n\r\nDue to a variety of technical considerations transaction history for CLI and KOS is stored as files. Each transaction is a separate file named with a hex transaction id.\r\n\r\n### Web IndexDb\r\n\r\nWeb transactions storage is not currently implemented. It will be backed by the browser IndexDb interface, but for now, the web wallet does not have a transaction history.\r\n\r\n### Unit and Integration Tests\r\nA lot of work remains in this area and will be gradually addressed over the coming weeks and months.\r\n\r\nEspecially the challenge has been handling mutations within JS API. There are some ideas and plans to automate JS API testing via Rust integration tests. Just a question of priorities.\r\n\r\n### Polling and Subscriptions\r\nSome limitations of Rusty Kaspa are currently bypassed using polling mechanisms as well as monitoring Kaspad logs. These will be improved and optimized in the future using the Rusty Kaspa notification subscription mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Intersection with the main node codebase\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made to avoid touching the main node codebase, with the exception of already integrated WASM bindings. The exception to this is 3 new RPC commands (get_system_metrics, get_server_status, and get_sync_status), which have been added as a part of the service but bound only to the wRPC pipeline.  Their use will be reviewed by core devs in the coming weeks and perhaps analogous command will be added to gRPC.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that due to this wRPC/gRPC proxy project is deprecated (although KOS has a feature gate that allows it to be built with legacy RPC compatibility).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/236/reactions",

"merged_at": "2023-10-06T12:41:39Z"}, "body": "This PR addresses the issue of the mempool being a bottleneck in the first testnet-11 experiment @ 10 BPS.\r\n\r\nThe previous monolithical design did lock both the `Mempool` and to some extent the virtual processor during every call to its public functions, through the `Manager` that owns it, leading to some long delays. **The new general design is to split the functions into simpler atomic steps logically protected by a lock on the mempool when the latter is implied**. This approach has following consequences:\r\n\r\n- The `Manager` owning the `Mempool` instance no longer is a simple pass-through locking and exposing mempool functions publicly. An important part of the mempool logic gets moved into the manager.\r\n- Some verification steps must sometimes be duplicated, particularly checking for double spends, since executing a `Manager` function is no longer atomic.\r\n- Some processes are reorganized and some behaviors do change, taking advantage of the potential this new design offers.\r\n\r\nAnother performance improvements are brought:\r\n\r\n- Processing batches of transaction in a topological order, forming sub-batches by levels of chained dependency\r\n- Parallel validation of sub-batches of transactions into the virtual processor, processing those in chunks formed up to a maximal mass so the virtual processor does lock for too long,\r\n- A more efficient algorithm for making room in the mempool when it is full and some transaction must be added. This process also has a modified behavior: the transaction with the lowest fee rate is removed, but (this is new) only among transactions having no chained dependency and not being a parent of the transaction getting added.\r\n\r\n### Validate and insert a single transaction\r\n\r\nIn order to bring a much finer lock granularity the function of validating and inserting a transaction into the mempool is split in 4 steps:\r\n\r\n1. pre-validation (read lock on `Mempool`)\r\n2. validation by the virtual processor (no lock on `Mempool`)\r\n3. post-validation and insertion (write lock on `Mempool`)\r\n4. validation and insertion of unorphaned transactions (see below)\r\n\r\n### Validate and insert unorphaned transactions\r\n\r\nFollowing any insert of a transaction into the mempool, some orphan transactions may be unorphaned. Here again we take advantage of the new design. On insertions, room is made on the fly if necessary and then we keep looping as long as new transactions are unorphaned (both new behaviors).\r\n\r\n1. parallel validation of batches of transactions (no lock)\r\n2. post-validation and insertion (write lock)\r\n3. in case of new unorphaned transactions, loop to step 1 (new behavior)\r\n\r\n### Validate and insert transactions in batch\r\n\r\nThis function is involved in the transaction relay flow, where a bunch of transactions gets broadcasted to peers. The batch is processed in a topological order by level of chained dependency (new behavior). For each level:\r\n\r\n1. pre-validation (read lock)\r\n2. parallel validation of the sub-batch of transactions by the virtual processor (no lock)\r\n3. post-validation and insertion (write lock)\r\n4. validation and insertion of unorphaned transactions\r\n\r\n### Handle the transactions of a block newly added to the DAG\r\n\r\nHere again, a split in 3 steps adds granularity in the locks.\r\n\r\n1. handling of transactions (write lock),\r\n2. validation and insertion of unorphaned transactions\r\n3. expiring the low level transactions (write lock)\r\n\r\n### Revalidate high priority transactions\r\n\r\nThis is probably the most important bottleneck alleviation, together with tx relay broadcasting. This process occurs only every 30 seconds and for a node getting a very high rate of local transactions, it was implying a _very_ computer intensive processing all under a single atomic lock of the mempool.\r\n\r\nThis gets redesigned as:\r\n\r\n1. getting all the high priority transactions (read lock)\r\n2. processing the batch in a topological order by level of chained dependency, instead of a \"standard\" Kahn's in-degree algorithm (new behavior)\r\n3. populating all transactions with UTXO entries found in the mempool (read lock)\r\n4. parallel validation of the sub-batch of transactions by the virtual processor (no lock)\r\n5. updating the transactions in the mempool and removing the invalid ones, along with all their redeemers (write lock)\r\n\r\nSince the process is now much more granular in how it locks both the mempool and the consensus, it may happen that some high priority transactions present at the beginning got removed (mined in a block, invalidated, etc.) during the (relatively long) process. The transaction id may or may not be returned as accepted depending on the sequence of events. But no impact is expected on the node. It will simply try to rebroadcast a transaction id that is no longer present and the peers requesting it will eventually get a `TransactionNotFound`, which may and does occur anyway for other reasons.\r\n\r\nThe behavior changes compared to the golang version in that on transaction validation error the error is simply logged and the execution continues whereas in golang the execution halts returning the error.\r\n\r\n## Performance gains\r\n\r\nCautious note: an upcoming PR will add a benchmarking infrastructure making it possible to measure the gains in performance, hence revealing to which extent this new design actually alleviates the bottleneck issue.\r\n\r\nDepending on the measures, some further adjustments might be needed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/226/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/226/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/225", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/225/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/225/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/issues/225/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/225", "id": 1807456883, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHrH1d85Vp3lw", "number": 225, "title": "Bump rocksdb version to 0.21", "user": {"login": "michaelsutton", "id": 6299204, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTkyMDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6299204?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelsutton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelsutton/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-07-17T10:25:18Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-17T10:58:28Z", "closed_at": "2023-07-17T10:58:24Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pulls/225", "html_url": "https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/225", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/225.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/225.patch", "merged_at": "2023-07-17T10:58:24Z"}, "body": "Bumps rocksdb crate version to 0.21.

processor where header-selected-tip and selected-chain store locks were acquired in reverse order. This deadlock became noticeable only with testnet 11 high bps which triggers more orphan resolution chain queries due to short-term orphans. \r\n\r\nThe PR also bounds the number of open files Rocks DB will attempt at opening at once so that they do not exceed OS limits.\r\n\r\nAnother important change which requires more fine tuning is a logarithmic increase in the orphan resolution range (as function of bps).\r\n\r\nLast but not least we compile release now with `overflow-checks = true` so that we catch any overflow bug during the stability period (already led to a few fixes).

Supporting this required implementing new reachability sub-algorithms which were never implemented in go-kaspad (which does not support on-the-fly header pruning). \r\n\r\nThe result of this PR is a node running with nearly-constant DB size (`4-6` GB in current mainnet). Having this functionality is especially important before going for higher BPS in testnet/mainnet in order to keep node maintenance steady and affordable. \r\n\r\nThe PR includes the following additions and changes:\r\n\r\n1. Support for safe \"deletion\" of a block from the DAG topology and from the reachability data structures.
