Description\r\n\r\nWith this change, we wrap an `Error` captured with e.g. `tracing::error` with the synthetic mechanism for `tracing` only if we effectively have a stack trace to be reported in the error, i.e. feature `backtrace` is enabled and `attach_stacktrace` is enabled.\r\n\r\nWithout this change, using `tracing::error!(error = <err>, <message>)` without the `backtrace` feature enabled would result in Sentry issues with `<unknown>` as title, as shown in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/723#issuecomment-2642497057.\r\n\r\nCloses #723 \r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn a() {\r\n    let err = \"NaN\".parse::<u32>().unwrap_err();\r\n    tracing::error!(error = std_dyn_err(&err), \"error with error\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn b() {\r\n    let err = File::open(\"non_existent_file.txt\").unwrap_err();\r\n    tracing::error!(error = std_dyn_err(&err), \"error with error\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn c() {\r\n    let err = File::open(\"non_existent_file.txt\").unwrap_err();\r\n    sentry::capture_error(&err);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"396\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 17 51 22\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf27077f-500b-4e98-80e3-c3361aa2e1c5\" />\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"340\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 19 41 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/786cb0b5-903d-4fed-b540-ec327a5b2427\" />\r\n\r\n`b` and `c` will now be grouped under a single issue. This makes sense as they are carrying an equivalent `Error`. In absence of stack frames, we cannot distinguish between the two.\r\n`b` will still include the additional message, the `mechanism: tracing` indicator and the `Rust Tracing Context`.\r\n<img

href=\"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md\">ring's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Version 0.17.13 (2025-03-06)</h1>\n<p>Increased MSRV to 1.66.0 to avoid bugs in earlier versions so that we can\nsafely use <code>core::arch::x86_64::__cpuid</code> and <code>core::arch::x86::__cpuid</code> from\nRust in future releases.</p>\n<p>AVX2-based VAES-CLMUL implementation. This will be a notable performance\nimprovement for most newish x86-64 systems. This will likely raise the minimum\nbinutils version supported for very old Linux distros.</p>\n<h1>Version 0.17.12 (2025-03-05)</h1>\n<p>Bug fix: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/2447\">briansmith/ring#2447</a> for denial of service (DoS).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic in <code>ring::aead::quic::HeaderProtectionKey::new_mask()</code> when\ninteger overflow checking is enabled. In the QUIC protocol, an attacker can\ninduce this panic by sending a specially-crafted packet. Even unintentionally\nit is likely to occur in 1 out of every 2**32 packets sent and/or received.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes a panic on 64-bit targets in <code>ring::aead::{AES_128_GCM, AES_256_GCM}</code>\nwhen overflow checking is enabled, when encrypting/decrypting approximately\n68,719,476,700 bytes (about 64 gigabytes) of data in a single chunk. Protocols\nlike TLS and SSH are not affected by this because those protocols break large\namounts of data into small chunks. Similarly, most applications will not\nattempt to encrypt/decrypt 64GB of data in one chunk.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overflow checking is not enabled in release mode by default, but\n<code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C overflow-checks&quot;</code> or <code>overflow-checks = true</code> in the Cargo.toml\nprofile can override this. Overflow checking is usually enabled by default in\ndebug mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/commits\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=ring&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.17.8&new-version=0.17.13)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Summary\r\nThis PR adds the ability to capture HTTP request bodies in the Sentry Actix middleware, allowing for better debugging and error tracking capabilities. The feature is configurable through the `max_request_body_size` option in `ClientOptions`.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added `MaxRequestBodySize` enum to control request body capture behavior:\r\n  - `None`: Don't capture request bodies (default)\r\n  - `Small`: Capture up to 1000 bytes\r\n  - `Medium`: Capture up to 10000 bytes\r\n  - `Always`: Capture entire body\r\n- Added request body capture support for `JSON` and `form-urlencoded` content types\r\n- Implemented body capture and restoration logic to maintain request integrity\r\n- Added necessary dependencies: serde_json, actix-http\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n- Request bodies are only captured for content types `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`\r\n- The body is read from the request stream and then restored to maintain middleware transparency\r\n- Size limits are enforced based on the configured `max_request_body_size` option\r\n- Empty string is returned for bodies exceeding size limits\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":

sense to have a common struct between the two that gets flattened (through serde) such that when `Event` gets new fields that may be useful in a `Transaction` then it'll already be there (as long as the function to enrich that hypothetical shared struct is used in both places).

Add a function to allow creating a `TransactionContext` with a custom Trace ID without a parent span ID.\r\n  My company is testing traces on Sentry in parallel to our current trace solution, for ease of use, we'd like to keep using the same trace ID on both platforms for now. Currently, my approach is to create a `sentry-trace` header with a zeroed span ID, but the UI has this bright red alert telling me that the parent span ID is invalid, and this is bugging me. I doubt I'm the only one who has faced this issue before.\r\n2. Implements support for the `traceparent` as stated in getsentry/team-sdks#41. `sentry-trace` still takes precedence. It does **not** emit the header, though. Should it? It only allows for parsing for now.\r\n3.

At first, I thought this was some strange autogrouping bug and event sent a feedback (sorry Sentry support member \ud83d\ude05).\r\n\r\nAfter digging a little bit, I discovered that the current tracing layer implementation sets the sentry span as active as soon as a tracing span is _created_, which should not be the case, as spans are only active once _entered_. Following the same logic, it also reverts to the parent span only when a span is _closed_, and not when it's exited.\r\n\r\nA span can be entered and exited multiple times, for example, when a tracing `Instrumented` future polls and returns Pending. In case of concurrent Instrumented futures, the current impl ends up nesting Futures under the first created one.\r\n\r\n### `sentry-tracing` layer (wrong)\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"Screenshot

This can be easily reproduced with the following setup:\r\n\r\n- `sentry-log` (or `sentry-tracing` if `tracing-log` is set up)\r\n- event filtering configured to generate breadcrumbs for debug logs\r\n- any cause for events to not be sent to the server\r\n\r\nShould the event fail to be sent for too long, the channel to the sender thread fills up and events start to be dropped. This will generate a debug log line, logging that an event has been dropped and why. With `sentry-log` (or `tracing-log` + `sentry-tracing`), this would generate a breadcrumb.\r\n\r\nHowever, the whole call to `Transport::send_envelope` is done in the context of `HubImpl::with`, that holds a read lock on the `HubImpl`'s stack. When generating the breadcrumb for the debug line, we end up calling `Hub::add_breadcrumb`, which calls `HubImpl::with_mut` to get a mutable reference to the top of the stack. However, since we already have a read lock on the stack, we deadlock on the write lock.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to move the call to `Transport::send_envelope` outside of the lock zone, and we use `HubImpl::with` only to clone the top `StackLayer`. Since this structure is only `Arc`s, the only performance hit is two `Arc` clones and not the whole stack cloning.\r\n\r\nWe hit this in prod because (for reasons) we had to backport the legacy pre-envelope transport, and this one uses the warning level when the channel is full. The default log filter is safe from this deadlock because debug events are dropped, but anyone enabling at least breadcrumbs for debug events are exposed to it.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "reactions": {"url":
