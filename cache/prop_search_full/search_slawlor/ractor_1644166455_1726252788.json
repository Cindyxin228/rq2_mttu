href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/releases\">codecov/codecov-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>v4 of the Codecov Action uses the <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/the-codecov-cli\">CLI</a> as the underlying upload. The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Codecov Action runs as a <code>node20</code> action due to <code>node16</code> deprecation. See <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/\">this post from GitHub</a> on how to migrate.</li>\n<li>Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>v3</code> versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).</p>\n<h2>What's

Here is one example from the code base I'm working with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl MyActor {\r\n    #[tracing::instrument(skip_all, fields(actor.id = tracing::field::Empty, actor.name_pretty = tracing::field::Empty))]\r\n    async fn handle_my_specialized_supervisor_evt(\r\n        &self,\r\n        myself: ActorRef<MyMessage>,\r\n        message: SupervisionEvent,\r\n        state: &mut

        tracing::Span::current()\r\n                .record(\"actor.name_pretty\", tracing::field::debug(who))\r\n                .record(\"actor.id\", tracing::field::display(who.get_id()));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        todo!() /* actual message handling */\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's another non-instrumentation-related message (using `if let` would be \"cleaner\", I think this is a copy-paste from the default `handle_supervision_evt` implementation):\r\n```rust\r\nimpl MyActor {\r\n    fn is_buildctl_runner_evt(\r\n        &self,\r\n        state: &mut BuildctlBuilderState,\r\n        message: &SupervisionEvent,\r\n    ) -> bool {\r\n        use SupervisionEvent::*;\r\n        match message {\r\n            ActorPanicked(who, _) | ActorTerminated(who, _, _) | ActorStarted(who) => {\r\n                state.managed_buildctl_builders.get_by_id(who.get_id()).is_some()\r\n            }\r\n            _ => false,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThese could be rewritten, respectively, like the following (ignoring the mess that is field formatting with the `tracing` package...)\r\n```rust\r\nimpl MyActor {\r\n    #[tracing::instrument(skip_all, fields(\r\n        actor.id = message.actor_id().map(tracing::field::display), \r\n        actor.name_pretty = message.actor_cell().map(tracing::field::debug)\r\n    ))]\r\n    async fn handle_my_specialized_supervisor_evt(\r\n        &self,\r\n        myself: ActorRef<MyMessage>,\r\n        message: SupervisionEvent,\r\n        state: &mut MyState,\r\n    ) -> Result<(), ActorProcessingErr> {\r\n        todo!() /* actual message handling */\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand (now with less pattern matching, at least?)\r\n```rust\r\nimpl MyActor {\r\n    fn is_buildctl_runner_evt(\r\n        &self,\r\n        state: &mut BuildctlBuilderState,\r\n        message: &SupervisionEvent,\r\n    ) -> bool {\r\n        message\r\n            .actor_id()\r\n            .and_then(|id| state.managed_buildctl_builders.get_by_id(id))\r\n            .is_some()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```", "reactions": {"url":

Basic functionality test coverage is added for our custom `JoinHandle` implementation.\r\n2. `tokio` has a `JoinSet` which has some minor syntactical changes from the standard `FuturesUnordered` from the futures crate which we can leverage in its stead.

actor to another actor, in `ractor`, invokes the parent-child relationship and makes the parent the supervisor of the child. This means if the parent dies, before the child can process a supervision event (in say a doubly-linked scenario), the child will be terminated as part of the parent's exit flow (and not just terminated, but killed halting any async work in any flow). \r\n\r\nThis is non-ideal for looser ownership scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the notion of `monitor`ing (along with `unmonitor` and `clear_monitors`) which allows a non-parent relationship to supervision. This means an actor can monitor another actor without being in the direct lifecycle path yet still receive supervision events.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In order to not require the state to implement `Clone`, we instead add a \"slimmed out\" supervision event for monitors, such that they (a) won't receive the actor's state upon a termination event, if available at all, and (b) won't receive the actual exception with potential extra information, rather a serialized string version. This helps require that the underlying `Actor::State` be as limited in trait implementations as possible (just `Send + 'static`)\r\n\r\nTests added on new functionality", "reactions": {"url":

won't immediately dequeue the next message from the factory's queue. It will only get a message on the next incoming factory message which additionally since there's a \"free\" worker, even with a backlog of work, that incoming message will jump the queue.\n\nThis is incorrect behavior, and queue'd message should be served first. This change makes it that when a worker is re-created, it will dequeue a message as the worker is now \"free\".\n\nTests added to cover this scenario going forward.", "reactions": {"url":

However, I was getting an issue around the use of ` #[async_trait::async_trait]` to mark the `impl Actor` for the existing structs. I imagine this didn't come up in development, since the `async_trait` lib is one of the examples. I know for certain libraries, such as `serde`, it's sometimes common to include the `Serialize, Deserialize` traits as re-exported from the base library (sometimes hidden behind a feature flag, if `serde` is optional), which prevents developers from having to manually re-add a second dependency in order to take advantage of it. I've done the same here, which seems to have solved the problem. If you have any questions or would like to discuss more, just let me know!

actors \"instantly\" in that we don't wait on the `pre_start` routine. This is helpful if you want to immediately have access to the `ActorRef<TActor>` so you can begin sending messages to it without blocking on the `pre_start` routine.\r\n\r\n**However** if the `pre_start` fails for any reason, it won't be captured unless the specific join handle is handled manually to monitor the spawning error. Documentation updated to reflect this.\r\n\r\nNew tests covering instant spawning added.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we're adding a small auto-implementation for types which implement `BytesSerializable` such that they are automatically implementing `ractor::Message` and can be network-sent. This makes most of the built-in numeric types, `()`, `String`s, and vectors of such able to immediately used in a cluster context.", "reactions": {"url":

Some initial docker-based, networked e2e integration tests to simulate a real cluster\r\n2. More unit tests on port handling + serialization/deserialization of `ractor_cluster` messages\r\n3. Missing serialization support for more basic types (`char` and `bool`) along with vectors of all supported types (numerics, `String`, `char`, `bool`, etc)\r\n4. Fix in proc macro to return all of the generics on an `RpcReplyPort` when possible. This allows for complex nested types to the port to be reply types.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/slawlor/ractor/issues/39/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
