Instead, all function values are just represented as lookups to egglog functions. An advantage of this approach is that we don't need to re-implement function application in anyway, we can just re-use our existing implementation. For defining the body of functions, we can just use rewrite rules.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-16 at 6 15 09\u202fPM](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/assets/1186124/f7fc097e-7e3d-46eb-b072-a7f3c63fb1cf)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was inspired by [@yihozhang's comment](https://egraphs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/375765-egg.2Fegglog/topic/embedded.20lambda.20functions/near/393293171) a while ago about how to embed functions in egglog.\r\n\r\nAs implemented, this supports functions that return primitives and eqsorts, since it uses the builtin mechanism for calling functions.\r\n\r\nAlthough it doesn't support anonymous functions at the moment, adding them would be relatively trivial I believe as syntactic sugar, that would translate to a new global function with a random name and a rewrite rule to cover all cases.\r\n\r\nI made sure that this implementation supports partial application, which is necessary for rewrite rules that transform functions.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is fairly self-contained as a primitive sort, requiring no changes to the parser or type checker. The only main breaking change is requiring a mutable EGraph pointer to be passed to primitive functions. This is necessary so that the function evaluation can possibly mutate the unionfind data structure, if new e-classes are created. I am unable to get access to a mutable egraph in the query checker, so these will panic if attempted to use in facts, they can only be used in action. This limitation seems reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the driving use cases for this on my end, besides just generally being cool to be able to optimize functional programs, is @sklam's example for [defining a higher level array API](https://gist.github.com/sklam/5e5737137d48d6e5b816d14a90076f1d?permalink_comment_id=4882443#gistcomment-4882443) and translating that within egglog.

unextractable and cannot be matched during rules: https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/301#issuecomment-1934665417\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPreviously, we had support for marking a whole function as unextractable. This PR extends that to also allow marking individual rows of a function as unextractable as well.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a high-level `:unextractable` parameter for the `rewrite` command to mark the LHS as unextractable after its been applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one way to support directional transformations/subsumption (closes #256 for now).\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in that issue, one concrete use case for this is in my rewrites for numba compatibility of array expressions. In that example, I have to [translate `mean` into `sum` expressions, when an `axis` parameter is passed to mean](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-python/blob/e8bcca69079d39514703d72bd2077896b3077791/python/egglog/exp/array_api_numba.py#L15-L30). I want the rewritten version extracted, but by default, the cost would be higher so it wouldn't be. My workaround at the moment was to [give the whole `mean` function a huge cost](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog-python/blob/main/python/egglog/exp/array_api.py#L1217-L1219) so it would always be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, that solution isn't ideal for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It mixes the rewrite logic with the original function definition. I would like all the numba logic to be contained in that separate module.\r\n2. It makes the extraction take longer because it's considering these large costs instead of just ignoring those options altogether.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, I could move the logic entirely to the rewrite.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the feature by storing a set of \"unextractable\" input values to each function. I am not sure if this is like safe for rebuilding, so I would love some feedback on that. If there is a better way of storing this information, I am happy to change it.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/301/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/301/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/296", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/296/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/296/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/296/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/296", "id": 2005192846, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGzhkjs5gEerx", "number": 296, "title": "Update link to Python docs", "user": {"login": "saulshanabrook", "id": 1186124, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExODYxMjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1186124?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook", "html_url": "https://github.com/saulshanabrook", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saulshanabrook/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-21T21:45:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-21T21:51:50Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-21T21:51:01Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/pulls/296", "html_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/296", "diff_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/296.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/296.patch", "merged_at": "2023-11-21T21:51:01Z"}, "body": "The Python docs have a new home, reflecting the updated Python package name.

terminate, rebuilding really always should.\r\n\r\n@oflatt wrote an egglog program in which rebuilding didn't terminate. The idea was:\r\n\r\n* Have some function `(function F (X X) X)`\r\n* Make `F` the merge function of some other function `(function G (Y) X :merge (F old new))`\r\n* Have an entry `(G arg1) => x`, `x`'s canonical member changes to `y`, and `arg1`'s canonical member changes to `arg2`. and we also have `(G arg2) => y`. \r\n\r\nDuring rebuilding, we notice that these two entries are equal (not just their keys, but also their values). In the current egglog code we _still run the merge function_,  creating a new entry `(G arg2) => (F y y)`. Furthermore, we union `y` and `(F y y)`. Then:\r\n\r\n* We rebuild `F`, potentially changing the canonical id for `y`.\r\n* That causes us to rebuild `G`, creating `(F y (F y y))`.\r\n* Then we rebuild `F` again...\r\n\r\nThis process continues _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a short-term fix, which is to never run the merge function if we are replacing a tuple with itself: merge functions already do not behave well if they aren't idempotent. In this case `(F x x)` always equaled `x` _eventually_, just not until we got a chance to union it. I think this behavior should be correct for any useful merge function, but it feels like a hack. I'm open to other fixes (maybe we can initialize `(F y y)` to `y` and never call `make_set`?)\r\n\r\ncc @yihozhang \r\n\r\n@oflatt do you mind if I add your test file to the egglog tests?

This design is declarative (one can inspect generated constraints) and scalable (one can add new type constraints to handle new features).\r\n* This PR fixes a number of issues with the current type checker, e.g., #196, #133, #113, and potentially #80.\r\n* The type inference algorithm supports _both_ polymorphism and ad hoc overloading: for example, it supports both polymorphic functions like `vec-add : vec<a> -> vec<a> -> vec<a>` and overloaded functions like `add`, which has several definitions such as `f64 -> f64 -> f64` and `String -> String -> String`.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the core IR:\r\n* The old `typecheck.rs` is refactored into several orthogonal passes: \r\n  * A lowering pass that transforms a `Rule` into `CoreRule`,\r\n  * A congruence pass that gets rid of redundant atoms, \r\n  * A canonicalize pass that removes equality check and \"canonicalizes\" variables,\r\n  * A type checking pass.\r\n  * Another lowering pass to `Program` (not currently implemented).\r\n* A `CoreRule` has two parts: `Query` and `Actions`. `Query` uses a conjunctive query--based IR, while `Actions` uses an imperative SSA-based `NormAction`, which is currently used in desugaring. The goal is to gradually phase out `NormExpr` once `desugar.rs` is refactored into several compiler passes over core IR, so that we have a unified internal IR for query analysis and transformation.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/219/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/219/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/218", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/218/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/218/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/issues/218/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/218", "id": 1868618772, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGzhkjs5Y38-t", "number": 218, "title": "Fix Web Demo badge link", "user": {"login": "gussmith23", "id": 1203329, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDMzMjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203329?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23", "html_url": "https://github.com/gussmith23", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gussmith23/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-08-27T20:12:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-28T20:38:49Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-28T20:38:49Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/egraphs-good/egglog/pulls/218", "html_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/218", "diff_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/218.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/pull/218.patch", "merged_at": "2023-08-28T20:38:49Z"}, "body": "Web Demo badge link pointed to the docs, not the web demo.

directly, but still be allowed to pattern match on them. I don't think exactly that is possible in Rust, but here is an alternative. We make the indices into the DAG opaque, but we leave the Term enum fully public. That way the API kinda pushes you toward only constructing one layer of a term at a time, which is exactly how it should be used. Oliver, what do you think?\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a bunch of tests about terms (and a bit about exprs). If we decide not to make the term index change, I can split this PR to just merge the tests.\r\n\r\nThere is also a test that demonstrates how a caller can still shoot themselves in the foot by taking TermId from one TermDag and passing it to a different TermDag. This could cause wrong results or panic.

stop being updated once it was closed).\r\n\r\nAlso if we want to refer to the changes in that old PR for posterity, we can continue looking at it in its frozen state.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
