unclear why an expression is represented in the egraph in the first place. In fact, these \"magic terms\" can sometimes be critical in finding an equality.

I call these existence explanations, and this PR implements them. Whenever a term is added to the egraph, the `Explain` keeps track of where it came from. This could be either from a rule application, from a parent being inserted, or from congruence.

ability to generate explanations for two terms being equivalent in the graph to egg. The `explain_equivalence` function on the runner provides an `Explanation` for two `RecExpr` being equal. This explanation has a tree format as well as a flattened format. In the tree format, children can be proofs. In the flattened format, there is only one rewrite happening between terms.\r\n\r\nUsers who which to perform unions themselves (either in custom appliers or in analyses) are required to use the `union_with_justification` function, which requires two patterns (lhs and rhs) and their substitution justifying the union. The `Explain` data structure internally finds enodes corresponding to the e-match for those patterns. \r\n\r\nImplementing proof-production involved some interesting design decisions. The biggest question is how to efficiently find the enodes corresponding to the user-given pattern. When the egraph congruence invariant is maintained, this is easy because the hash-cons allows us to find each node matching the pattern from bottom-up. So the solution in this PR is that whenever `union_with_justification` is called, the congruence invariant needs to be true.\r\n\r\nHere's how that works:\r\n- Instead of applying each union directly, unions are put on a `to_union` stack and delayed until rebuilding. So until rebuilding, the memo remains updated and calls to `union_with_justification` are valid.\r\n- At rebuilding, we apply all the unions.\r\n- Previously, maintenance of analysis was interweaved with rebuilding, but this won't work anymore because congruence has not been restored.\r\n- So after rebuilding, we apply analysis results and rebuild again until fixpoint. But further analysis unions must also be delayed, so there is another stack for that. So far it's unclear what the performance hit of doing this is.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR isn't ready yet- I've posted it so @mwillsey and others can see it.\r\nTODOS:\r\n- [x] Documentation of functions\r\n- [x] Documentation of proof generation, including explanations of explanation trees and flattened explanations\r\n- [x] Make proof-generation flag work, including disallowing calling `union` directly in explanation-generation mode\r\n- [x] Caching in proof-generation\r\n- [x] Decided against adding Herbie benchmarks\r\n- [x] Let bindings so you can reuse proofs in the printed output\r\n- [x] Benchmarking how the change to rebuilding affects performance\r\n- [x] Reduce overhead of proof production when feature is off- don't delay unions?\r\n- [x] Change rewrite rule string to an Arc\r\n- [x] Simplify union_with_justification api\r\n- [x] Pass patternast as a Cow from apply_one\r\n- [x] Optional- add tutorial\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

which will always add one layer of non-determinism. However, it turns out this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nConsider the example `(+ ?x (+ a b))`, current compilation algorithm will make the program to search for all `+`-app enode `e`, and for each enode in `e.children[1]`, search for the pattern `(+ a b)`. However, because the eclass `(+ a b)` always maps to the same eclass, we can have a simple `Compare` operator to check for eclass equality.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `Load` operator, which will pop the last `node.len()`-many  Id in the register and push to the register the corresponding enode. Under this compilation algorithm, all ground patterns will be loaded once before the actual e-matching and will be used for comparison. Finally, during compilation, ground patterns are given higher priority and will thus be considered first.\r\n\r\nIt reduces the run time of the following query from 11.2s (resp. 10.4s) to 9.95ms
