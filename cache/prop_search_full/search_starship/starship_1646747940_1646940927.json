IMO this is much more pleasant to browse.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605384/156494940-877bf2f0-8b69-4fc7-b174-5fce8e61d872.png)\r\n\r\n- Replaced all screenshots with a semi-standardized set of screenshots. Note: I'm not 100% sure about this change: currently the screenshots all look very similar to each other, but I don't know how to fix this. Maybe it's because the terminal background is too similar to the default Vuepress grey?\r\n\r\n- Presets have been factored out into their own pages, that have a screenshot, the full config inlined via a [code snippet import](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#import-code-snippets), prerequisites (if any), and a download link for the TOML.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605384/156495054-fa08a82f-56ae-4d84-bb08-36e16f65acf8.png)\r\n\r\n- Modified Cargo.toml to no longer include translated READMEs (in accordance with the comment above the `include` line) and include all preset TOML files.\r\n\r\n- Added the Python symbol to the NerdFont preset, which was previously missing (though now that I look at the screenshots again, I can see that the Rust symbol is also missing...dammit).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/3683/reactions", "total_count": 0,
