If you have an issue on GitLab you can press a button on that issue to automatically create a merge request and a branch for you. However, the pattern for the branch name is `${ticket_nr}_${title}.toLowercase().replaceAll(\" \", \"_\")`.\r\n\r\nFor issue number 1234 and title #1234 \"Fix the typo in the about page when you right click something\" we get a branch named `1234_fix_the_typo_in_the_about_page_when_you_right_click_something`.
