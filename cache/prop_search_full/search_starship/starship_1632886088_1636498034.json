the prompt (3.0.2).\r\n\r\n##### RVM (rvm 1.29.12-next)\r\n```\r\n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s -- --ignore-dotfiles\r\nsource $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\r\nrvm install 3.0.1\r\n```\r\nIn a new terminal, `source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm` adds the correct ruby version to the prompt (3.0.1).\r\n\r\nOne issue with RVM is that by default, it is activated permanently through the user's `.profile` files. If someone has a ruby env activated this way, they may not want to see the ruby version all the time, so I added the detect_variables option to make this check configurable.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Description\r\n\r\nMoves shell prompt escaping to the level of individual format variables\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nSeveral previous attempts to fix this have been made, with different levels of success.\r\n\r\nThis version means that the user can have special prompt chars in expected places, e.g. `format` setting and also in the output of custom commands. But at the same time protects against injections from outside sources, e.g. git branch names or special chars in folder names.\r\n\r\nAs all the module expose outside data though variables this is a good place to do the escaping, whilst still allowing purposeful special chars in the format string.\r\n\r\nCloses #3072\r\nAlso see context #3058 and #658\r\n\r\nUnfortunately its quite large because of the need to pass the `context.shell` var into the string formatter.\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nFixed special chars (% in this case for zsh) not interpreteted:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 12 41 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/704356/135428734-0a4b5970-0979-403b-b375-2a843e9d4710.png\">\r\n\r\nPreviously (the green is a custom command that outputs control sequences: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"705\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 16 37 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/704356/135465835-e8235387-9cbd-4b96-a50e-0db1f6521ee6.png\">\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\r\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n- [X] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

This allows starship to start without errors in the case where pipestatus is empty (usually due to interactions with other shell frameworks).\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation of pipestatus assumed that the arguments to pipestatus would be word-split (bash, zsh) or repeated by the shell (fish). Unfortunately, this causes a shell parse error if pipestatus is not set on first invocation (which can apparently happen if other shell frameworks are present).\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to fix this:\r\n  1. Modify the init scripts to not use `--pipestatus` at all when pipestatus is detected to be empty.\r\n  2. Quote the arguments to `--pipestatus`, which allows clap to detect an empty argument, and then change the parsing code in starship to split the arguments ourselves.\r\n\r\nI have implemented the second here, since the first requires significantly complicating the init scripts for bash/zsh.\r\n\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

There is a separate issue which appears, where on shell startup, the exit status of the previous command is not defined, so starship prints a warning about not being able to parse the exit status. However, it's not as clear to me how to fix that issue, since we do want the warning to appear when a status cannot be parsed.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\r\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [x] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
