#677\r\n\r\nintroduces improved logging capabilities across multiple components, providing more flexibility and control over log output. Key updates include:\r\n\r\n* **Configurable Log Levels**\r\n  Users can now set the verbosity of logs using levels such as `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.\r\n\r\n* **Optional Log File Output**\r\n  Logs can optionally be written to a file via the `-f` flag, in addition to standard output (`stdout`), supporting better log persistence and analysis.\r\n\r\n* **Verbose Mode**\r\n  When `-v` is used in combination with `-f`, logs are written to both `stdout` and the specified log file.\r\n\r\nThese enhancements do **not** affect the existing \"Getting Started\" tutorial or existing default behavior.\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run -- --config config-examples/pool-config-local-tp-example.toml -v -f pool.log --log-level debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n\r\n* Write logs to both `stdout` and `pool.log`\r\n* Set the log level to `DEBUG`\r\n\r\n### Default Behavior\r\n\r\n* **Log Level:**\r\n  Defaults to `INFO` if no level is specified or if an invalid level is provided.\r\n\r\n* **Log Output:**\r\n  If `-f` is not set, logs are printed only to `stdout`.\r\n\r\n* **Verbose Mode (`-v`):**\r\n  Requires `-f` to be set. When used, logs are written to both `stdout` and the specified file.\r\n\r\n* **No Flags Provided:**\r\n  If none of the new flags are used, behavior remains unchanged: logs are printed to `stdout` at `INFO` level, maintaining compatibility with existing usage and tutorials.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/1785/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1":

`VarInt` prefix as the size of the array, followed by the serialized bytes... or in other words, `rust-bitcoin` serializing a `Vec<TxOut>`)\r\n\r\nthis function was being used to deserialize outputs from `SetCustomMiningJob`, which are serialized under Bitcoin consensus rules (`Vec<TxOut>`)\r\n\r\n`NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs` however follows a different rule, where `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs_count` carries the size of the array, and `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs` simply has the raw bytes (no `VarInt` prefix to indicate the size of the array)\r\n\r\nin

motivation of this PR was #1466 \r\n\r\nas described on this issue, the entire `roles_logic_sv2::common_properties` module felt somewhat redundant, since most of its meaningful usage happened inside `mining_proxy_sv2` crate, which we've been considering deprecation https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/discussions/1643\r\n\r\nin fact, not only this module, but also `roles_logic_sv2::channel_logic::proxy_group_channel` and `roles_logic_sv2::job_dispatcher` and a significant portion of `roles_logic_sv2::channel_logic::channel_factory`\r\n\r\nso I went ahead with a more practical approach:\r\n- deprecate `mining_proxy_sv2` crate\r\n- deprecate `roles_logic_sv2::common_properties` module\r\n- deprecate `roles_logic_sv2::channel_logic::proxy_group_channel`\r\n- deprecate `roles_logic_sv2::job_dispatcher`\r\n\r\nthis incurred in small adaptations to:\r\n- `pool_sv2`\r\n- `translator_sv2`\r\n- `jd_client`\r\n\r\nthere were also relatively large adaptations to `roles_logic_sv2::channel_logic::channel_factory` which stripped it of a lot of functions that were rendered unused\r\n\r\n`roles_logic_sv2::channel_logic::channel_factory` remains used on  `translator_sv2` (where it will likely be replaced via [#1623](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/1623)) and `jd_client`\r\n\r\nonce #1623 is addressed, the only thing preventing deprecation of `roles_logic_sv2::channel_logic::channel_factory` (#1634) will be its usage on `jd_client`\r\n\r\nclose #1466 \r\nclose #1464", "reactions": {"url":

encountering a non-deterministic error on SRI (thanks to @plebhash and @lucasbalieiro for pointing that out), which continues to stem from the network_helpers. My initial suspicion that the issue was due to senders and receivers from network_helpers not being properly dropped during shutdown was only partially correct.\r\n\r\nIn reality, some structures still hold ownership of the channel endpoints from network_helpers, which prevents tasks from exiting cleanly. This leads to stale loops that persist even after a disconnection or a SIGTERM is received.\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly closes all relevant channels on any downstream disconnection or upon receiving a SIGTERM, ensuring a full shutdown of the connection. While this should resolve the immediate issue, we also need to reassess the widespread use of 'static lifetimes throughout the codebase.

restructures the network_helpers noise_connection flow to make it simpler and more reliable. Previously, we were starting background tasks before completing the handshake, which made the flow confusing and likely caused ghost tasks. Now, the handshake is fully completed first, and only then are the read/write tasks spawned. We also removed the shared state wrapped in sync primitives instead, each stream gets its own cloned state, avoiding unnecessary locking since encryption and decryption are independent in Noise. Overall, this simplifies the architecture, hopefully eliminated zombie task, and makes the flow much easier to reason about.", "reactions": {"url":

of `stratum-common`. This introduces a circular dependency if `roles-logic-sv2` continues to access the `bitcoin` crate via `stratum-common`.\r\n\r\nTo break this cycle, I removed the `bitcoin` and `secp256k1` re-exports from `stratum-common`.

The goal is to improve **maintainability**, **consistency**, and **readability** by replacing custom argument parsing logic with `clap`\u2019s declarative approach.\r\n\r\n* Migrated from manual CLI parsing to `clap`-based parsing.\r\n* Reduced redundancy and simplified argument handling across modules.\r\n* Preserved existing command names and default values to ensure backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n* Verified functionality by following the instructions in the [Getting Started guide](https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/#ii-getting-started---running-all-roles).\r\n* Confirmed that no CLI APIs were broken as a result of this refactor.", "reactions": {"url":

"Partially Resolves: stratum-mining/sv2-apps#9\r\nThis PR is part of an effort to improve error handling in the translator. Currently, there are several redundant .map_err calls in the codebase, which make the code harder to read. This PR removes many of them. However, not all instances could be removed due to the use of non-Send types like MutexGuard errors, which cannot be used in Send contexts (e.g., in tokio::spawn). Addressing these cases will require more targeted changes, which we can defer until we work on those parts of the codebase.", "reactions": {"url":
