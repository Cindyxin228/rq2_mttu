which when summing up the remaining bytes can overflow 2^32 bytes. Since the spec mandates that descriptor chains must not exceed 2^32 bytes, let's just terminate iteration once we overrun.\r\n\r\nThe tests demonstrate how the overflows happened before. While virtio-queue does not directly suffer from any consequences, this guards consumers from having to handle this on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nLink: https://rust-vmm.slack.com/archives/CFH3R8PFV/p1682002847952759\r\n\r\n### Summary of the PR\r\n\r\nTerminate iterating over a descriptor chain that is longer than 2^32 bytes.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your PR, please make sure you addressed the following\r\nrequirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] All commits in this PR are signed (with `git commit -s`), and the commit\r\n  message has max 60 characters for the summary and max 75 characters for each\r\n  description line.\r\n- [ ] All added/changed functionality has a corresponding unit/integration\r\n  test.\r\n- [ ] All added/changed public-facing functionality has entries in the \"Upcoming \r\n  Release\" section of CHANGELOG.md (if no such section exists, please create one).\r\n- [ ] Any newly added `unsafe` code is properly documented.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/issues/236/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/issues/236/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/issues/235", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/issues/235/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/issues/235/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/issues/235/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/pull/235", "id": 1676263211, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCv4bz85OvmE2", "number": 235, "title": "fuzz: iterate only over descriptor chains", "user": {"login": "andreeaflorescu", "id": 2815944, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2815944?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu", "html_url": "https://github.com/andreeaflorescu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-20T08:33:25Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-21T13:06:38Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-21T10:57:15Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/pulls/235", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/pull/235", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/pull/235.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-virtio/pull/235.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-21T10:57:15Z"}, "body": "### Summary of the PR\r\n\r\nWe were iterating over both descriptor chains, and descriptors in a chain. This was triggering a timeout when running the fuzzer. When implementing a device though, this timeout should not happen because the device implementation must make sure to only retrieve as many descriptor chains as it needed.
