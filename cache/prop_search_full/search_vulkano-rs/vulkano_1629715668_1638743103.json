I've also reorganised the modules a bit, so that the modules for each state type are placed under `graphics` instead of directly in `pipeline`. This should make it neater when ray tracing pipelines are introduced. I've included some new documentation as well, especially for the `graphics` and `vertex_input` modules.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this, I came across a few existing shortcomings that need to be addressed in future PRs:\r\n- Specifying shader interface entries using a general numeric type instead of a `Format`, and allowing more flexible matching between shader and attribute format. This is issue #1667, and requires refactoring the `Vertex` trait and the code in `BuffersDefinition`.\r\n- Allowing multiple variables to share a location, using the `component` decoration. This is made possible with `VertexInputState` as introduced in this PR, but it is not supported when using `BuffersDefinition`. It also requires rethinking of the `Vertex` trait.\r\n- 64-bit input values. Because they take up two components per value, and must be matched exactly by the attribute format, they need special care.

However, I noticed that this reserve is filled with new descriptor sets as soon as the previous one runs out, which causes problems for variable counts.\r\n\r\nWhen the reserve is empty, and you call `next`, it creates a new internal `UnsafeDescriptorPool`, then immediately allocates as many descriptor sets as possible from it. It then returns one of those descriptor sets for you to build, and adds the rest in its reserve. In the case of variable count layouts, this would mean that it allocates not just one descriptor set with the desired variable count, but a whole bunch of them.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that this would lead to a lot of wasted descriptor sets, because those descriptor sets can only be used if the variable count is exactly the same. Perhaps the allocation strategy should be changed so that it allocates only one descriptor set at a time, and the reserve is only filled when allocated descriptor sets are dropped and returned to the pool.

I fixed this by getting rid of the old method of populating the p_next structures and instead using the Ash functionality.\r\n- The exportable image must also be created with an additional structure [VkExternalImageCreateInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo.html). I added a method to `UnsafeImage` which does this, and I used it accordingly in `AttachmentImage`.\r\n- Issue 17 of OpenGL [EXT_external_objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_external_objects.txt) demands that the mutable bit be set when some common extensions are present. I thus set it to true by default, but perhaps @hakolao can provide his input on whether this would make sense when sharing images with CUDA.\r\n\r\nThe result of these issues was heavy visual corruption on the AMD radeonsi driver. Interestingly, the Intel Iris driver does not suffer from visual corruptions even with the p_next creation structures missing.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining issue at the moment is a crash happening with the Intel Iris driver, when flushing the signal semaphore command from the OpenGL side. Running a debug version of the driver, it prints out `Failed to submit batchbuffer: Invalid argument`. Given that the driver does not pass the piglit `vk-semaphores-2` test, this is probably a problem within the Iris driver. I will submit a bug report to the Mesa repository.\r\n\r\nI have created some [sample code](https://gist.github.com/fayalalebrun/8845ba4464af687895cf49ba96b105d6). This program draws to a shared texture with Glium from another thread, which is the drawn to the window by Vulkano. This texture oscillates between a black and green color.

Examples of how this looks are in the... well, examples.\r\n\r\nI added support for the `ext_extended_dynamic_state` and `ext_extended_dynamic_state2` extensions, which add \"dynamicness\" to a lot of existing pipeline state.

"Changelog:\r\n```markdown\r\n- **Breaking** `Compare` is renamed to `CompareOp` to match Vulkan.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- Replaced the various dynamic state querying methods of `GraphicsPipeline` with two: `dynamic_state` to query a single dynamic state, and `dynamic_states` to iterate over all of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the Vulkan spec, if a pipeline contains _fixed_ state, then it overwrites any _dynamic_ state that was previously set. Vulkano didn't track this before, but it became an issue with #1684. This PR fixes that by tracking, for every graphics pipeline, which state is \"baked into\" the pipeline, which it expects to be given dynamically, and which state isn't in the pipeline at all. `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` in turn deletes all the overwritten state whenever you bind a new pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe changelog doesn't mention any of this, since it's internal behaviour. The only user-visible changes are the rename, and the different interface on `GraphicsPipeline` and the two new types I introduced for this purpose, `DynamicState` and `DynamicStateMode`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1722/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1722/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1721", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1721/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1721/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1721/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1721", "id": 1010153036, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAk0cF84sabv3", "number": 1721, "title": "Group command buffer state retrieval under a new `CommandBufferState`", "user": {"login": "Rua", "id": 3090610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA2MTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rua", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-09-28T20:01:38Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-03T08:54:22Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-29T06:20:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1721", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1721", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1721.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1721.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-29T06:20:06Z"}, "body": "Changelog:\r\n1.

of a project. The existing examples lack usable \"wholes\". E.g. deferred example is great, but it could even go as far to demonstrate something more useful rather than a triangle.\r\n\r\nI've found that I prefer Vulkano over e.g wgpu and other libraries which is why I'd like to see nicer examples here.\r\n\r\nI thought a simple interactive fractal explorer app made over the weekend could demonstrate Vulkano usage better inside a non-trivial project. Or just get new interested developers up to speed faster.\r\n\r\n It contains\r\n - Compute pipeline to calculate Mandelbrot and Julia fractals writing them to an image target\r\n - Graphics pipeline to draw the fractal image over a quad that covers the whole screen\r\n - Renderpass rendering that image over swapchain image\r\n - An organized `Renderer` with functionality good enough to copy to other projects\r\n - Simple `FractalApp` to handle runtime state\r\n - Simple Input system to interact with the application\r\n\r\nLet me know if you prefer to keep the examples more \"contained\" around specific features or if I'm doing something wrong with vulkano here.

Added a `spirv` module to the main crate, which contains an auto-generated parser for SPIR-V files, and various other utilities that can be used to analyze shaders at runtime.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SPIR-V parsing types and functions, auto-generated from the SPIR-V grammar document, which is included. The grammar is a JSON document, so this adds `serde_json` as a build-dependency for parsing. Some of the code has been moved from Vulkano-shaders and reworked. In particular, any parse errors that are reported will include information on the affected instruction, where the error happened, and the SPIR-V words of the instruction for debugging.\r\n\r\nThis is still a draft; the main parsing feature is now done, but I want to add code to gather some additional data from the module after it's parsed.

This does not work well with `Cuda` interops and I think it's better to use dedicated allocations.~~\r\nEdit: I suppose the file descriptor might  stay the same anyway... But I found my issues with the buffers and images disappear when using the dedicated allocation.\r\n\r\n- Example: Let's say my first buffer is vertices, second indices. The indices would be pointing somewhere else than my cuda buffer pointer when filling the indices with cuda (offsetting didn't seem to help).\r\n\r\nI had solved this for months by using my own pool and by allocating a chunk of memory for buffers, and then using that one chunk for my purposes managing offsets myself on the cuda pointers. This though is rather needless and does not work with images. I want images :D\r\n\r\nAll kinds of weird bugs appeared when trying to let Vulkano choose whether the allocation becomes dedicated or not.

This feature improves type-safe interoperability between shaders.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis Pull Requests addresses an old-standing issue in Vulkano-Shaders of lack of a type-safe way of interoperability between shaders' interfaces.\r\n\r\nAssume the user declares two independent shaders relaying on the same glsl struct `Foo` in their layouts(e.g. one compute shader writes to the buffer with this struct, another one reads from the same buffer). Prior to this PR the user would have to put two independent invocations of Vulkano Shaders macro producing two independent sets of `Shader`, `Layout` and a  `Foo` Rust structs in the `ty` submodules per each invocation. Direct interoperability between these two Rust `Foo` structs is impossible because Rust treat them as independent types in independent submodules(even though both structs are completely the same in their definitions, fields and names). The user would have to workaround this problem either by introducing explicit casting between generated Rust types, or maybe through the unsafe transmutations between types. In either way the user would have to deal with multiple duplicate Rust types growing multiplicatively when the number of shaders is grow.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature in Vulkano Shaders macro to compile several shaders together. In this new mode the macro inspects all types mentioned in the sources of the shaders, checking if there are no signature clashes between them, and puts final generated Rust structs without duplications in a single shared `ty` submodule common for all specified shaders.\r\n\r\nNote, this is not a Breaking change. This new feature is still optional for the users. Also, I provided an example that demonstrates how to use it in practice.\r\n\r\nRelated to #259.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1694/reactions",

This avoids interpretation problems where the underscore is significant for the meaning.\r\n  - The `ty` method and the `FormatTy` enum are removed. They are replaced with the `NumericType` enum, which concerns itself only with the numeric representation and not with other properties. There are now three `type_*` methods to retrieve it, for colour, depth and stencil respectively.\r\n  - The `planes` method now returns a slice containing the equivalent single-plane formats of each plane.\r\n- **Breaking** The `ImageAccess` trait no longer has the `has_color`, `has_depth` and `has_stencil` methods. This information can be queried using the `aspects` or `type_*` methods of `Format`.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- Non-breaking `Format` additions:\r\n  - Formats and their metadata are now auto-generated from vk.xml. This significantly expands the support for YCbCr formats in particular.\r\n  - The `compatibility` method returns an object that can be used to check the compatibility of two formats, explained [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap43.html#formats-compatibility-classes).\r\n  - The `components` method returns the number of bits in each colour component.\r\n  - The `compression` method returns the compression scheme as a new enum, `CompressionType`.\r\n  - The `requires_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` method returns whether the \"sampler YCbCr conversion\" must be enabled on an image view and sampler in order to use this format.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a bunch of new formats that weren't supported yet, expands with new methods to query particular properties, and makes the existing methods more sane. I also wrote some better documentation for the `format` module. The ability to test for format compatibility allows #1666 to be solved, while all the other new methods fulfill other validity-testing use cases that are currently unimplemented. Sampler YCbCr conversion would certainly be worth a future PR.\r\n\r\nThe biggest, and perhaps most controversial breaking change is that the variants are now uppercase snake-cased like in C, rather than camelcased like is customary in Rust. But I found that this increases readability of the names a lot for complex formats. Take `G16_B16R16_2PLANE_420_UNORM` for example. In Rust camelcase, this would end up as `G16B16R162Plane420Unorm`, where the 16 and 2 are no longer separated, and no distinction is made between components in the same plane and components in different planes (G in one plane, B and R in the other). Similar problems occur with names like `G8B8G8R8_422_UNORM` and `PVRTC1_2BPP_UNORM_BLOCK`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1687/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1687/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685", "id": 981579328, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzIxNTk5NzE0", "number": 1685, "title": "Update wgpu link in readme", "user": {"login": "heavyrain266", "id": 71175207, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTc1MjA3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71175207?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266", "html_url": "https://github.com/heavyrain266", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-08-27T20:36:14Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-28T09:09:45Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-27T23:05:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1685", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-27T23:05:17Z"}, "body": "Previous link provided currently archived version.\r\n\r\n1.

Because not everything is lumped into the draw call now, users can be more flexible in what state they set. It should also be easier to introduce additional state, from extensions or future Vulkan versions, without breaking existing code (but of course at the cost of horribly breaking everything in one go now, haha).\r\n\r\nVulkano previously performed no validation on push constants at all, and this PR adds some validation. But it's currently impossible to validate everything. The reason is rather embarassing: the specification is not clear on when push constants remain valid after they have been set. This is a known issue to the Vulkan spec team: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/1485. Until the spec is clarified on that matter, Vulkano can't do much itself.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1684/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
