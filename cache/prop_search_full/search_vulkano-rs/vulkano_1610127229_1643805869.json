In my particular use case, I used a `sampler2DArray[]` to store textures of different sizes/formats, with auto-generated descriptors and name-to-index lookup - which didn't quite work out at first because one of the arrays only have a single image.

The project is more like a tech demo / simulator, but I'll continue on it separately to make a game. But I wanted to release the simulator as is and thought it would be nice to addition to Vulkano showcase. I also use my [egui_winit_vulkano](https://github.com/hakolao/egui_winit_vulkano) integration so I can use [Egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) for the user interface.\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hakolao/sandbox/master/img/sandbox.gif)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the weirdest part of this Simulator is just having been able to make the Cellular Automata work with compute shaders.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder why Vulkano isn't more popular, or if it is, why isn't it visible like `wgpu` is or others. I've found the API much nicer to work with than any other rendering APIs that I've use (limited use).

The original intent was to make this into multiple separate PRs, but because they all overlap in scope, they depend on each other and would have a lot of merge conflicts. Putting it all in one was easier. The good news is that most of the breaking changes are in things that I expect only more advanced Vulkano users would use. None of the examples had to be changed.\r\n\r\nThe new vk.xml added in #1793 includes a new section with format information, so I rewrote the part of autogen that generates the formats to use the XML data instead of trying to parse it from the names. It's much cleaner this way. I changed some of the method names and other details on `Format` to match the terminology used in the XML.\r\n\r\nI found that `UnsafeImage` was lacking a lot, so I basically rewrote the whole thing. It has a builder now, which helps when there's a lot of parameters and it also prevents having to break things when new parameters are added. More validation checks were also added, and some correctness issues were addressed. As far as I can tell, it's completely safe to construct now, so the builder is not `unsafe`. I think that the \"safe\" image types could be changed to use a builder as well, but I think it would be even nicer to have a single generic image type that can handle all use cases, instead of all the different ones that Vulkano has now.\r\n\r\nRegarding the move of `ComponentMapping`: at the moment `ImageView` is the only thing that uses it, but I had a look at the Vulkan spec, and it seems that it's actually used quite frequently in extensions to the `Sampler` that Vulkano doesn't currently support, but may support in the future. Moreover, only image views that are used as sampled images can actually be used with a component mapping, storage images and attachment images can't, so it's already associated with sampling even if indirectly.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1797/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1797/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1796", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1796/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1796/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1796/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1796", "id": 1100795298, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAk0cF84w4YII", "number": 1796, "title": "Fix documentation", "user": {"login": "dpytaylo", "id": 18236144, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjM2MTQ0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18236144?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo", "html_url": "https://github.com/dpytaylo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpytaylo/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-01-12T21:14:03Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-23T21:07:20Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-23T19:27:52Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1796", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1796", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1796.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1796.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-23T19:27:52Z"}, "body": "1.

Specifically, it now includes information about samplers that are used with specific sampling instructions, storage images that are used with atomic instructions, and which images are sampled by each sampler. This is needed for additional validation checks required by the spec that Vulkano doesn't currently implement. These checks are not included in this PR, but it at least makes it possible to implement them.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `mutable` field has been changed so that it applies for each index individually for multi-descriptor bindings. This means that different buffers or images in an arrayed binding can have different mutability. Furthermore, the mutability is determined based on whether any instructions write to the variable now, instead of whether it has the `readonly` qualifier. Consequently this qualifier is probably no longer needed (although it might help the driver optimise).\r\n\r\nThere are a few shortcomings still that are more difficult to solve:\r\n- For arrayed/multi-descriptor bindings, the reflection code can only determine the descriptor index being accessed if the index is a constant within the SPIR-V code. Indices could be non-constant (with e.g. the `shader_sampled_image_array_dynamic_indexing` feature), in which case the reflection code can't figure it out.\r\n- I'm unsure if atomic operations on storage buffer data count as \"mutable\" or not for the purposes of synchronisation. For now, I've left them as not mutable.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1786/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1786/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1783", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1783/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1783/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1783/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1783", "id": 1084947979, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAk0cF84wFm1M", "number": 1783, "title": "Fix undefined behaviour on external semaphore & image creation; Fix wrong device chosen on hybrid graphics", "user": {"login": "fayalalebrun", "id": 2482295, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODIyOTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2482295?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun", "html_url": "https://github.com/fayalalebrun", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fayalalebrun/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2021-12-20T15:57:02Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-04T21:15:41Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-04T21:14:18Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1783", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1783", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1783.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1783.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-04T21:14:18Z"}, "body": "Currently, whenever an exportable image or semaphore are created, the p_next structure used to specify the exportable handle types falls out of scope prematurely, which means segmentation faults can occur in certain situations, most likely when the stack memory is overwritten or is invalidated. \r\n\r\nIn order to fix this, I've not only made sure to define these p_next structures in the appropriate scope, but I've also changed the implementations to use ash builders.

The `exact_entrypoint_interface` argument to the `shader!` macro is removed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Arc-blroth This effectively undoes #1559. This could be controversial, and I realise I was in favour of the original change back in April, but I have a few reasons for making this change:\r\n1. Since #1729 and #1744, the information that is gathered from shaders is only what is *required* as a minimum by the shader. It no longer generates a full-blown descriptor set layout like it did before. In this light, I think it makes more sense that the requirements reflect the entry point chosen by the user, instead of every possible entry point.\r\n2. As noted at https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1556#issuecomment-821658405, different entry points can have conflicting requirements. For example, one entry point could want a buffer on binding 0, another could have a texture on the same binding.\r\n3. I want to improve checking whether a storage descriptor is mutable or not, by analysing whether a given entry point performs any write operations on it. This is what the official validation layer does, and it would remove the need for users to put `readonly` in their shaders. This check makes more sense on a per-entrypoint basis.\r\n4. I would like to do more validation on shader requirements than currently, with additional fields on `DescriptorRequirements`. The official validation layer checks for atomic operations on images, which require `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_ATOMIC_BIT`. It also makes a list of which images are used with which samplers, which is needed for checking if the image and sampler are compatible. This is needed for supporting the `VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` extension, which I'd like to implement at some point. This extra validation only makes sense on a per-entrypoint basis too.\r\n\r\nBoth `ComputePipeline` and `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` have ways to construct a pipeline with a user-provided pipeline layout, so the user already has the ability to make a layout with more sets and bindings than the minimum needed by the shader entry point. When using raw Vulkan, this is what the user would always have to do; the ability to create a minimal layout automatically based on the requirements of the shader is purely a convenience to the user.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, an advantage to creating an explicit pipeline layout that is compatible with multiple shaders: it allows descriptor sets to remain bound when switching between pipelines, as long as the shaders have compatible interfaces. So this may be something Vulkano should actually encourage the user to do (in documentation), and make it more explicit that creating a new layout based on the minimum requirements is only a convenience that's useful for certain situations, not generally.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1778/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

Added convenience constructors for writing non-arrayed bindings.\r\n- **Breaking** Descriptor sets are no longer constructed using a builder, but with an iterator of `WriteDescriptorSet` items. See in the examples how this is used.\r\n  - `PersistentDescriptorSet::start` has been replaced with three constructors, `new`, `new_variable` and `new_with_pool`. Each of these takes an iterator of `WriteDescriptorSet`.\r\n  - `SingleLayoutDescSetPool::next` takes an iterator of `WriteDescriptorSet` as well.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes how descriptor sets are constructed, which will probably break a lot of existing code. But it allows for some things that were not possible before:\r\n- It is possible to leave some descriptors unset, if the shader does not use them. This is especially important if `PARTIALLY_BOUND` support is added later.\r\n- `push_descriptor_set` can be applied incrementally, like it was intended by the spec.\r\n- It makes it easier to add support for updating existing descriptor sets (after constructing/using them), which allows more efficient usage and is also needed for `UPDATE_AFTER_BIND`. For this to work, descriptor sets need some kind of locking mechanism to prevent updates when the descriptor set is in use.\r\n\r\nI realised that `PersistentDescriptorSet` and `SingleLayoutDescSet` have a lot of code in common, so I created a new `DescriptorSetInner` type to handle the common behaviour. This type is not public, it's only an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, I will be investigating whether I can add support for the `VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template` extension, which was promoted to Vulkan 1.1. This extension introduces an alternative way to update descriptor sets that reads the data directly from a buffer on the host (CPU), which can be more efficient than constructing `WriteDescriptorSet` objects.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1774/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1774/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1772", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1772/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1772/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1772/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1772", "id": 1071571297, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAk0cF84vaJTr", "number": 1772, "title": "Upgrade to Rust 2021, update dependencies", "user": {"login": "Rua", "id": 3090610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA2MTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rua", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-12-05T22:12:08Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-14T10:34:19Z", "closed_at": "2021-12-16T08:46:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1772", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1772", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1772.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1772.patch", "merged_at": "2021-12-16T08:46:44Z"}, "body": "```markdown\r\n- **Breaking** Updated to half 1.8, smallvec 1.7, winit 0.26, raw-window-handle 0.4.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- Upgraded to Rust 2021.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRust 2021 is a much smaller change than 2018 was, but it's still nice to have, especially for the ability to call `into_iter` on arrays properly now.

If there is no variable count binding in the layout, this should be 0.\r\n  - The `alloc` method of `UnsafeDescriptorPool` now takes an iterator of `DescriptorSetAllocateInfo`.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- For `PersistentDescriptorSet` when using a layout with a variable count binding, allocate only the number of descriptors needed instead of always the maximum.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #1740.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to retain variable count functionality for `SingleLayoutDescSetPool`. I thought it would be enough to split the internal reserve of available descriptor sets based on the number of variable descriptors. However, I noticed that this reserve is filled with new descriptor sets as soon as the previous one runs out, which causes problems for variable counts.\r\n\r\nWhen the reserve is empty, and you call `next`, it creates a new internal `UnsafeDescriptorPool`, then immediately allocates as many descriptor sets as possible from it. It then returns one of those descriptor sets for you to build, and adds the rest in its reserve. In the case of variable count layouts, this would mean that it allocates not just one descriptor set with the desired variable count, but a whole bunch of them.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that this would lead to a lot of wasted descriptor sets, because those descriptor sets can only be used if the variable count is exactly the same. Perhaps the allocation strategy should be changed so that it allocates only one descriptor set at a time, and the reserve is only filled when allocated descriptor sets are dropped and returned to the pool.

Previously, the pipeline layout object was used for this, but a pipeline layout isn't really the right place for it, since the same layout could be used with multiple shaders, each with their own specific requirements. Moreover, a shader might not actually use every descriptor that's declared in the pipeline layout, the layout can be a superset of what the shader needs. In this PR, only the resources the shader actually needs are checked. Descriptors that aren't used by the shader can still be bound, but are ignored in the check.\r\n\r\nIn theory this means that it's now safe to create a descriptor set that doesn't contain resources in all of its descriptors, because all that matters is that the resources needed in the shader are valid. That is required for allowing incremental bindings for push descriptors. But that isn't implemented yet; I'm still thinking of ways to do that.

I fixed this by getting rid of the old method of populating the p_next structures and instead using the Ash functionality.\r\n- The exportable image must also be created with an additional structure [VkExternalImageCreateInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo.html). I added a method to `UnsafeImage` which does this, and I used it accordingly in `AttachmentImage`.\r\n- Issue 17 of OpenGL [EXT_external_objects](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_external_objects.txt) demands that the mutable bit be set when some common extensions are present. I thus set it to true by default, but perhaps @hakolao can provide his input on whether this would make sense when sharing images with CUDA.\r\n\r\nThe result of these issues was heavy visual corruption on the AMD radeonsi driver. Interestingly, the Intel Iris driver does not suffer from visual corruptions even with the p_next creation structures missing.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining issue at the moment is a crash happening with the Intel Iris driver, when flushing the signal semaphore command from the OpenGL side. Running a debug version of the driver, it prints out `Failed to submit batchbuffer: Invalid argument`. Given that the driver does not pass the piglit `vk-semaphores-2` test, this is probably a problem within the Iris driver. I will submit a bug report to the Mesa repository.\r\n\r\nI have created some [sample code](https://gist.github.com/fayalalebrun/8845ba4464af687895cf49ba96b105d6). This program draws to a shared texture with Glium from another thread, which is the drawn to the window by Vulkano. This texture oscillates between a black and green color.

Some of these were existing types that were renamed.\r\n  - Most of the state-setting methods on `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` are deprecated. State is now set using a `_state` method, which is given one of the above state types.\r\n- **Breaking** `DynamicStateMode` is replaced with a simple `bool`.\r\n- **Breaking** The presence of dynamic state in the pipeline state is now expressed more explicitly with two new types, `StateMode` and `PartialStateMode`.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- Added support for lots more dynamic state, most of which requires features or extensions to use.\r\n- Added support for discard rectangles, in the `pipeline::discard_rectangle` module.\r\n- Added support for line rasterization state, in the `pipeline::rasterization` module.\r\n- Added support for color write enable state, in the `pipeline::color_blend` module.\r\n- `GraphicsPipeline` now has methods to return each state object it was created with.\r\n- `ash` has been updated to 0.33.3, which provides new features and extensions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA very large PR this one! A lot of new states and features are added here. I decided to change how state is provided to `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` because there was starting to be too much of it, making the number of methods unreadably large. Now, instead, the builder simply takes state objects, each of which has a pure Vulkan equivalent. These state objects have convenience builder methods where appropriate, and sensible defaults. Examples of how this looks are in the... well, examples.\r\n\r\nI added support for the `ext_extended_dynamic_state` and `ext_extended_dynamic_state2` extensions, which add \"dynamicness\" to a lot of existing pipeline state. In addition, I added three completely new pipeline states.\r\n\r\nI hope I didn't miss out on any important/breaking changes.

with two: `dynamic_state` to query a single dynamic state, and `dynamic_states` to iterate over all of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the Vulkan spec, if a pipeline contains _fixed_ state, then it overwrites any _dynamic_ state that was previously set. Vulkano didn't track this before, but it became an issue with #1684. This PR fixes that by tracking, for every graphics pipeline, which state is \"baked into\" the pipeline, which it expects to be given dynamically, and which state isn't in the pipeline at all. `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` in turn deletes all the overwritten state whenever you bind a new pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe changelog doesn't mention any of this, since it's internal behaviour.

Added a `spirv` module to the main crate, which contains an auto-generated parser for SPIR-V files, and various other utilities that can be used to analyze shaders at runtime.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SPIR-V parsing types and functions, auto-generated from the SPIR-V grammar document, which is included. The grammar is a JSON document, so this adds `serde_json` as a build-dependency for parsing. Some of the code has been moved from Vulkano-shaders and reworked. In particular, any parse errors that are reported will include information on the affected instruction, where the error happened, and the SPIR-V words of the instruction for debugging.\r\n\r\nThis is still a draft; the main parsing feature is now done, but I want to add code to gather some additional data from the module after it's parsed.

This feature improves type-safe interoperability between shaders.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis Pull Requests addresses an old-standing issue in Vulkano-Shaders of lack of a type-safe way of interoperability between shaders' interfaces.\r\n\r\nAssume the user declares two independent shaders relaying on the same glsl struct `Foo` in their layouts(e.g. one compute shader writes to the buffer with this struct, another one reads from the same buffer). Prior to this PR the user would have to put two independent invocations of Vulkano Shaders macro producing two independent sets of `Shader`, `Layout` and a  `Foo` Rust structs in the `ty` submodules per each invocation. Direct interoperability between these two Rust `Foo` structs is impossible because Rust treat them as independent types in independent submodules(even though both structs are completely the same in their definitions, fields and names). The user would have to workaround this problem either by introducing explicit casting between generated Rust types, or maybe through the unsafe transmutations between types. In either way the user would have to deal with multiple duplicate Rust types growing multiplicatively when the number of shaders is grow.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature in Vulkano Shaders macro to compile several shaders together. In this new mode the macro inspects all types mentioned in the sources of the shaders, checking if there are no signature clashes between them, and puts final generated Rust structs without duplications in a single shared `ty` submodule common for all specified shaders.\r\n\r\nNote, this is not a Breaking change.

This avoids interpretation problems where the underscore is significant for the meaning.\r\n  - The `ty` method and the `FormatTy` enum are removed. They are replaced with the `NumericType` enum, which concerns itself only with the numeric representation and not with other properties. There are now three `type_*` methods to retrieve it, for colour, depth and stencil respectively.\r\n  - The `planes` method now returns a slice containing the equivalent single-plane formats of each plane.\r\n- **Breaking** The `ImageAccess` trait no longer has the `has_color`, `has_depth` and `has_stencil` methods. This information can be queried using the `aspects` or `type_*` methods of `Format`.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- Non-breaking `Format` additions:\r\n  - Formats and their metadata are now auto-generated from vk.xml. This significantly expands the support for YCbCr formats in particular.\r\n  - The `compatibility` method returns an object that can be used to check the compatibility of two formats, explained [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap43.html#formats-compatibility-classes).\r\n  - The `components` method returns the number of bits in each colour component.\r\n  - The `compression` method returns the compression scheme as a new enum, `CompressionType`.\r\n  - The `requires_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` method returns whether the \"sampler YCbCr conversion\" must be enabled on an image view and sampler in order to use this format.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a bunch of new formats that weren't supported yet, expands with new methods to query particular properties, and makes the existing methods more sane. I also wrote some better documentation for the `format` module. The ability to test for format compatibility allows #1666 to be solved, while all the other new methods fulfill other validity-testing use cases that are currently unimplemented. Sampler YCbCr conversion would certainly be worth a future PR.\r\n\r\nThe biggest, and perhaps most controversial breaking change is that the variants are now uppercase snake-cased like in C, rather than camelcased like is customary in Rust. But I found that this increases readability of the names a lot for complex formats. Take `G16_B16R16_2PLANE_420_UNORM` for example. In Rust camelcase, this would end up as `G16B16R162Plane420Unorm`, where the 16 and 2 are no longer separated, and no distinction is made between components in the same plane and components in different planes (G in one plane, B and R in the other). Similar problems occur with names like `G8B8G8R8_422_UNORM` and `PVRTC1_2BPP_UNORM_BLOCK`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1687/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1687/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1685/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685", "id": 981579328, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzIxNTk5NzE0", "number": 1685, "title": "Update wgpu link in readme", "user": {"login": "heavyrain266", "id": 71175207, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTc1MjA3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71175207?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266", "html_url": "https://github.com/heavyrain266", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/heavyrain266/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-08-27T20:36:14Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-28T09:09:45Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-27T23:05:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1685", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1685.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-27T23:05:17Z"}, "body": "Previous link provided currently archived version.\r\n\r\n1.

This matches how these commands work in Vulkan.\r\n  - Validity of the state is checked by the dispatch/draw commands.\r\n  - `DynamicState` is removed; each individual state now has its own command to set it. This includes some states that were not previously included in `DynamicState`.\r\n- **Breaking** `StateCacher` is removed; its task is now partially handled by `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`.\r\n```\r\n```markdown\r\n- `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now has methods to return the state set by previous commands.\r\n- Added support for `u8` index buffers with the `ext_index_buffer_uint8` extension.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the followup PR I mentioned in https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1661#discussion_r685322007. It has been long in the making, and figuring out descriptor set and layout compatibility has been a particular pain, so I'm glad this one is over with! Once again, this brings Vulkano design closer to Vulkan, hopefully without sacrificing safety or idiomaticity. Because not everything is lumped into the draw call now, users can be more flexible in what state they set. It should also be easier to introduce additional state, from extensions or future Vulkan versions, without breaking existing code (but of course at the cost of horribly breaking everything in one go now, haha).\r\n\r\nVulkano previously performed no validation on push constants at all, and this PR adds some validation. But it's currently impossible to validate everything. The reason is rather embarassing: the specification is not clear on when push constants remain valid after they have been set. This is a known issue to the Vulkan spec team: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/1485. Until the spec is clarified on that matter, Vulkano can't do much itself.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1684/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

"Changelog:\r\n```markdown\r\n- **Breaking** `StencilFaceFlags` is renamed to `StencilFaces`, and its variants are also shortened.\r\n- **Breaking** `DynamicStencilValue` now contains a `front` and a `back` value.\r\n- **Breaking** The stencil state commands of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now take a `StencilFaces` value and a `u32` instead of `DynamicStencilValue`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way the dynamic state for stencil values was set up was wrong, perhaps due to a misunderstanding of how things work. For each dynamic state setting (compare mask, write mask and reference), there are always two values associated: the value applied to front faces, and the value applied to back faces. These values should both be set when drawing, but Vulkan lets you set both values independently or in one go.\r\n\r\nThe way Vulkano seems to have treated this previously is as if the face specifier is simply part of the dynamic state being set, but it's not; both values should always be specified. This is why `DynamicStencilValue` is changed so that it always contains both a front and a back value. For the set commands of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, I stayed closer to raw Vulkan, so that you specify a new value and the face(s) for which this new value should apply.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1662/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1662/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1661", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1661/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1661/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1661/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1661", "id": 960468485, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzAzNDg4OTQz", "number": 1661, "title": "Add vertex and instance parameters to draw commands", "user": {"login": "Rua", "id": 3090610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA2MTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rua", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-08-04T13:39:03Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-03T08:54:52Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-12T14:14:02Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1661", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1661", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1661.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1661.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-12T14:14:02Z"}, "body": "Changelog:\r\n```markdown\r\n- **Breaking** The `draw` and `draw_indexed` commands on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` now take parameters to explicitly specify the range of vertices and instances to draw.\r\n- **Breaking** `BufferlessDefinition` is removed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solves the issue mentioned in #1619 that the user is unable to have full control over the vertices and instances being drawn.

`SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` accept any `IntoIterator` where they previously only accepted `Iterator`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1635. In order to do this, quite a few changes needed to be made elsewhere, some of which were in separate PRs that have already been merged. This PR contains only internal changes, nothing user facing. The following changes were made internally to `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`:\r\n- The builder now tracks which binding state was most recently set by which command.\r\n- `FinalCommand` is gone, so the built command buffer now uses the regular `Command`.\r\n- Each `Command` is now stored in an `Arc` instead of a `Box`, which allows them to be referenced from multiple locations. A future PR could probably change the remaining cases where a command index is used to simply clone the `Arc`.\r\n- Using this, draw and dispatch commands can now hold references to the bind commands that set the state they use.\r\n\r\nNow that `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` is tracking binding state, it partially overlaps in function with `StateCacher`. This could allow a future PR to make the latter obsolete entirely.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1650/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1648", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1648/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1648/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1648/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1648", "id": 953736825, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njk3NzMzODgx", "number": 1648, "title": "Add `VertexInput` type", "user": {"login": "Rua", "id": 3090610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA2MTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rua", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rua/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2021-07-27T10:26:57Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-10T08:38:35Z", "closed_at": "2021-07-28T08:50:52Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pulls/1648", "html_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1648", "diff_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1648.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/pull/1648.patch", "merged_at": "2021-07-28T08:50:52Z"}, "body": "Changelog:\r\nReplace the line about `VertexDefinition` with:\r\n```markdown\r\n- **Breaking** The `VertexDefinition` trait no longer has `AttribsIter` and `BuffersIter` as associated types.
