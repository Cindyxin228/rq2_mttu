This occurs by spawning a\nsubprocess that passes <code>--all-features</code>. <code>cargo test --doc</code> works with most combinations of\nfeature flags, including the default. The combination of these changes means that crater will now\nrun on <code>time</code>.</li>\n<li><code>libc</code> and <code>num_threads</code> are only included as dependencies when needed. They were previously\nunconditionally included.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>time::format_description::parse_owned</code>, which returns an <code>OwnedFormatItem</code>. This avoids &quot;lifetime\nhell&quot;, where all your structs now need a lifetime because a single field has one. Note that when\npossible, the borrowed format item (just called <code>FormatItem</code>) is still preferred, as it has\nsignificantly fewer allocations. The new <code>OwnedFormatItem</code> is usable for both formatting and\nparsing, as you would expect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The parser for runtime format descriptions has been rewritten. A side effect of this is that some\nerrors have slightly changed. No existing API has been altered, so this is not a breaking change.\nHowever, you may notice different errors, which are hopefully better! The parser for compile-time\nformat descriptions has not yet been swapped out. If you notice any bugs, please file an issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/d97594b9f5cfeab0335c16687e26a8b51c56a526\"><code>d97594b</code></a> 0.3.17 release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/88f5c134f3c55465f896a806c267c664280bda40\"><code>88f5c13</code></a> Fix concurrency for GitHub actions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/e5e2a601880a63dc28a657c31aea156d470d510b\"><code>e5e2a60</code></a> Update lints</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/27ea0d44f46c2875ea121ccbb0fec1b844531194\"><code>27ea0d4</code></a> Use <code>parse_owned</code> in tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/4887aa7c43465296e959766d15a4e97e9da2d339\"><code>4887aa7</code></a> Add <code>format_description::parse_owned</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/2ba92f67b1d55389c6a6692557428c2dbe58c0be\"><code>2ba92f6</code></a> Configure codecov</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/2cba2ef2f56db69f31bab953ba217b825875d208\"><code>2cba2ef</code></a> Add tests for <code>OwnedFormatItem</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/4d18c08d8e3d6411370e888374ae580e026544c4\"><code>4d18c08</code></a> Implement owned format descriptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/139aba1460f142b06eace74bc176ab7113dd9521\"><code>139aba1</code></a> Move <code>FormatItem</code> definition to its own module</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/commit/e4b40add3fe4ecadc5ef9345e0233e06dfb5d233\"><code>e4b40ad</code></a> Remove extraneous debug call</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/compare/v0.3.16...v0.3.17\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=time&package-manager=cargo&previous-version=0.3.16&new-version=0.3.17)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
