users of `domain` that may use `Dname` as keys in standard library collections, who may want to query those collections with non-owned `Dname`.\r\n\r\nInclude a doc comment testing that a collection of `Dname<Vec<u8>>` can be queried with a `Dname<[u8]>`.\r\n\r\nthis comes from talking with @edmonds today, who was trying to do the seemingly-reasonable operation of building a map of `Dname` and associated attributes, then looking entries in that map up from a `Dname` built from a `&[u8]`. unfortunately, i think the best we can do is best-effort implementations of `Borrow` for `T: AsRef<[u8]>` that seem \"useful enough\"; there would need to be another impl for someone who has made a collection keyed on `Dname<Bytes>`, for example.\r\n\r\n~_ideally_ we'd be able to write `impl<Octs: AsRef<[u8]>> Borrow<Dname<[u8]>> for Dname<Octs>`, but `rustc` (unfortunately, correctly), realizes that that permits `impl Borrow<Dname<[u8]>> for Dname<[u8]>`, which conflicts with the [blanket impl of `Borrow<T> for T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html#impl-Borrow%3CT%3E-for-T) in stdlib. i figured noting that wrinkle is helpful in the doc comment for any future confused souls, but i don't know your appetite for other `Borrow` impls (or this one!) in `domain` itself - users _could_ add a newtype in their code and write an appropriate `Borrow` impl for any owned octet collections they're using in their containers.~\r\n\r\nedit: turns out the above issue was trying to write an `impl<Octs: AsRef<[u8]> + ?Sized>`, but `impl<Octs: AsRef<[u8]>` alone is

traits and types defined in `base::octets` for their equivalent in the `octseq` trait. These are mostly the same except that they facilitate Generic Associated Types as stabilized in Rust 1.65. This results in subtly changed trait bounds, though mostly these should be invisible to the user.\r\n\r\nOne notable change is that `octseq` makes the error type of the `OctetsBuilder` generic and uses `Infallible` for those types where appending data will never fail (which, for most users, is all of them). It provides methods for either case and we are mirroring these in `domain`. While this means that converting you code to using the PR will require some work, that work should mostly be removing unwraps \u2013 which is nice.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re using the opportunity to clean up a few more things that have crept into the code over time. A list of which will be added here:\r\n\r\n*  The range, slice, and split methods on the domain name types have changed. They have been merge into a single method taking ranges \u2013 except for those on `Dname` that require type changes. The split methods now take references and don\u2019t change `self` anymore. This is somewhat required by the limitations imposed by the new `Octets` trait but feels better, anyway.\r\n\r\n* The `Parse`, `Compose`, and `Scan` traits have been demoted to mere extension traits for foreign types (primarily the built-in integers, so that you can do things like `u16::parse`). All other types now simply have methods matching the patterns. Where generics are necessary, dedicated traits have been added. E.g., there now are `ParseRecordData` and `ComposeRecordData` traits that are implemented by all record data types.\r\n\r\n* Composing of record data and options has been switched to a scheme where the size is predetermined whenever possible instead of composing the data and then updating the length after. Since this is not possible for record data that uses compressed names when compression is actually in use, the old scheme is still used in this particular case.", "reactions": {"url":
