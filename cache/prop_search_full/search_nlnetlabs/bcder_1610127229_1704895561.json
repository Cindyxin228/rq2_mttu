entire way that errors are handled while decoding.\r\n\r\nSources now provide errors related to them failing the get more data when there should be more via the associated `Source::Error` type. This has been renamed from `Source::Err` for consistency with other such associated types.\r\n\r\nA new type `ContentError` is introduced for errors where incorrectly encoded data is encountered, be actual encoding errors or data that isn't following the ASN.1 definition or informal profiles. This type wraps an error message that currently can be either a static `str` or a boxed `Display` trait object but can be extended if necessary later.\r\n\r\nSince both source and content errors can happen during decoding, the compound type `DecodeError` wraps both these types. For content errors it also stores where in source the error happened to facilitate debugging. Currently, this type only allows displaying the error. It can be extended if additional access to the internally stored error is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe various content decoding methods now return a `DecodeError`.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement all these changes, the `Source` trait had to be adjusted. First, it needs to be able to provide the current position. This meant that it couldn\u2019t be implemented on `Bytes` and `&[u8]` directly anymore. Therefore, the new trait `IntoSource` allows to convert a type into its `Source` implementation.\r\n\r\nFinally, the trait's methods got cleaned up a bit. Specifically, `Source::advance` now only allows advancing as far as the length most recently returned by `Source::request` which also means it cannot fail anymore but needs to panic if the length is too large. This consistent to how `Source::bytes` already behaves.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NLnetLabs/bcder/issues/65/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,
