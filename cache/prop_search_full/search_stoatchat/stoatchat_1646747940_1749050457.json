I've got a preliminary cross-compilation (`amd64`/`arm64`) setup going with the `base`, `bonfire`, and `delta` container images here. Testing has been a bit wonky, but all six images are building on my local M1 machine.\r\n\r\nWith cross compilation, `buildx` of `base` for both platforms takes about **10 minutes** for me vs **???** with emulation \ud83d\ude04.\r\n\r\nI plan to create a separate branch and try triggering some build and push Actions on my fork, but wanted to get the work out there sooner for comment in case my removal of `cargo install` in the separate service images was going to cause problems.\r\n\r\n\u270c\ufe0f ", "reactions": {"url":
