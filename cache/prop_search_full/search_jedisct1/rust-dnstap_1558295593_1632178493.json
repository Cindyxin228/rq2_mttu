In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please merge this PR and migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then._\n\nDependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.\n\n[Learn more about migrating to GitHub-native Dependabot][learn]\n\nPlease note that
