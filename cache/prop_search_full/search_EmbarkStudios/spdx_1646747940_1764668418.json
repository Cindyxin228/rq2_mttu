All the metadata is static so we can look it up as necessary. `name`, `full_name`, and `flags` have been changed to getter methods to accommodate this. This brings their size down from 48 bytes to 8 bytes. Reducing the size of the index type is unlikely to bring any further benefit, since these types are stored in enums that have variants just as large.\r\n- The external document reference variants in `AdditionItem` and `LicenseItem` have been boxed, since I don't expect them to be very common. This brings `AdditionItem` and `LicenseItem` down from 56 bytes to 16. [They *could* be 8 bytes if Rust learns to optimize them better.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3204) This in turn takes `LicenseReq` from 104 bytes to 32.\r\n\r\nTuning the `SmallVec`
