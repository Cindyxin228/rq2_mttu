released (release announcement forthcoming).\r\n\r\nFor derive users, there isn't too much different.  By specifying a default `#[clap(action)]` or `#[clap(value_parser)]` attribute, you opt-in to the new behavior that will be the default in clap 4.0.  The main difference is instead of the `parse` attribute that is unique to the derive, you now have the `value_parser` attribute which comes from `Arg::value_parser`.  When no `value_parser` is specified, we'll default to `value_parser!(T)` which will auto-select an appropriate value parser for the given field's  core type.  In practice, this means the default `value_parser` for `PathBuf` is now safe to use.\r\n\r\nWe also renamed `ArgEnum` to `ValueEnum` to make the name more meaningful and for some future work we'll be doing.  `value_parser` mostly gets rid of the need for `value_enum` attribute except for when dealing with defaults, so I just left the attribute in place.  I went ahead and switched some enums that were almost `ValueEnum` to being `ValueEnum`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/431/reactions",

a local filesystem path.

various config options in the `bans` and `licenses` that allow specifying a crate had an optional `version` component that could be used to restrict the match to a specific semver range. If none was specified, this would default to the `*` wildcard match to match any version of the crate. However, `*` has a non-intuitive interaction with pre-releases...they actually won't match. This causes user confusion since pre-releases are relatively rare in the rust ecosystem, and most people (myself included) think that `*` means everything, not everything, except for this niche case. So now, all config `VersionReq`s are _actually_ optional, and if not specified will match any version.\r\n\r\nEven though this is _technically_ a breaking change, I actually consider this a bug fix

If the `allow` list represents the set licenses for a project that have gone through some external approval process, such as vetting it with a legal department.\r\n2. You're checking a single project in a workspace that shares its `deny.toml` for all members, but not all members have identical dependency sets.\r\n3. You'd like to use `deny.toml` as part of a project template, and configure it with some default set of licenses you find acceptable\r\n4. ... others, for sure...\r\n\r\nAs it is, this warning isn't a huge deal, but is annoying/unhelpful if you don't care about it. I suspect that it's useful for catching typos or keeping configuration tight (and so I think \"warn\" is the right default for it), but there are enough reasons to want to turn it off that it seems justified to me for it to be an option.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to add support for a config property which controls the lint level for this check, so I just did that. I guess setting it to `deny` could be desirable in some cases, although it seems a little dodgy to me for various reasons... That said, I didn't see a reason to forbid that sort of thing, and allowing it to be configured as a `LintLevel` seemed more consistent.\r\n\r\n### Regarding the code:\r\n\r\nI don't care about the name of this property, so if you'd like me to change it LMK. I think this name is clear, but it is a bit verbose and maybe there's something better or more consistent. (Unfortunately, a lot of the more obvious names I thought of were actually confusing because of the usage of \"allow\" to refer to both the lint level and the list being linted)\r\n\r\nI've tested it manually, since AFAICT this code isn't covered by tests. Or maybe I just missed them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nP.S. I also fixed the `.gitattributes` in the first commit. I'm fine dropping that commit (it's unrelated to the patch and not really my business) but that file *is* binary, and so it shouldn't be marked as text. Without this, git kept insisting on replacing CRLF with LF in it (or maybe it was the other way around), which was very annoying, and definitely does not result in a valid zstd file.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/368/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/368/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/364", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/364/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/364/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/364/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/364", "id": 984335886, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzIzNzgxNjk2", "number": 364, "title": "Added deny.toml and cargo.toml headers to code snippets", "user": {"login": "TuckerBMorgan", "id": 9058927, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTg5Mjc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9058927?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan", "html_url": "https://github.com/TuckerBMorgan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TuckerBMorgan/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-08-31T21:24:52Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-02T17:40:29Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-02T17:40:29Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pulls/364", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/364", "diff_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/364.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/364.patch", "merged_at": "2021-09-02T17:40:29Z"}, "body": "Took a look at the docs to add the file headers for deny, and Cargo, seemed to only to be two place in a single file.

Checklist\r\n\r\n* [X] I have read the Contributor Guide\r\n* [X] I have read and agree to the Code of Conduct\r\n* [X] I have added a description of my changes and why I'd like them included in the section below\r\n\r\n### Description of Changes\r\n\r\nSince `difference` is unmaintained, replace it with `similar` exactly matching the previous behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso remove unencountered ban skips\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI debated using `dissimilar` vs `similar`\r\n\r\nI tried using `dissimilar` first since: it's half the size, twice the downloads, and the maintainer is already sponsored by embark studios\r\nHowever due to the way it finds differences I needed to write quite a bit of logic to replicate the structure output by the existing `difference` changeset\r\n\r\nIf you have these inputs:\r\n\r\noriginal:\r\n```\r\nabc\r\ndef\r\n```\r\n\r\nnew:\r\n```\r\nabc\r\ndgg\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gives the changes like so:\r\n\r\nunchanged:\r\n```\r\nabc\r\nd\r\n```\r\n\r\ndeleted:\r\n```\r\nef\r\n```\r\n\r\ninserted:\r\n```\r\ngg\r\n```\r\n\r\nso you then need to account for the shared `d` and just generally it was more code than you probably want to maintain for a simple diff in an info log people wont see on the default warn level\r\n\r\n`similar` had a line by line diff which made it easy to recreate the `difference` behavior in a couple of extra lines\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI used manual escape codes rather than `ansi_term` to keep the colors identical to `difference`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/blob/88dda4a8c827af9b06ab2cc0e4bac0656dd2f7bd/src/cargo-deny/fix.rs#L127-L128\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI saw in a PR swapping difference to similar they had speed regression issues but I found the speed to be about the same (slightly faster in a quite quick and unscientific test)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-pretty-assertions/pull/51\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hyperfine --warmup 3 '../../target/debug/cargo-deny -L info fix --dry-run' './new/cargo-deny -L info fix
