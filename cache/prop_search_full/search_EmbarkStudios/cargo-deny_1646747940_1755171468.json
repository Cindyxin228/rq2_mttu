have any mistakes for contribution, please let me know...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons you might want this:\r\n\r\n1. If the `allow` list represents the set sources for a project that have gone through some external approval process, such as vetting it with a legal department.\r\n2. You're checking a single project in a workspace that shares its `deny.toml` for all members, but not all members have identical dependency sets.\r\n3. You'd like to use `deny.toml` as part of a project template, and configure it with some default set of sources you find acceptable\r\n4. ... others, for sure...\r\n\r\nAs it is, this warning isn't a huge deal, but is annoying/unhelpful if you don't care about it. I suspect that it's useful for catching typos or keeping configuration tight (and so I think \"warn\" is the right default for it), but there are enough reasons to want to turn it off that it seems justified to me for it to be an option.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to add support for a config property which controls the lint level for this check, so I just did that. I guess setting it to `deny` could be desirable in some cases, although it seems a little dodgy to me for various reasons... That said, I didn't see a reason to forbid that sort of thing, and allowing it to be configured as a `LintLevel` seemed more consistent.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- This PR is for #781 \r\n- This PR modification is very similar with #368 \r\n- config name, `unused-allowed-source` is inspired by `licenses.unused-allowed-licens` in #368 ", "reactions": {"url":

issue where crate sources were not being correctly determined as crates.io when using cargo 1.85.0 due to the change in how directory names are calculated, which would cause eg. workspace dependency checks to fail.\r\n\r\nThe advisory databases no longer use tame_index to perform the directory naming as it doesn't really make sense in the first place, so now it just uses a similar method, but using xxhash instead which gives the same properties as the cargo 1.85.0 change, namely that the hash is the same for the same url regardless of the host platform (endianness/pointer width/arch). It also now uses the last path component as the start of the name which is a much nicer way to name the directory.\r\n\r\nThis also updates to the rust-version to 1.85.0 and moves to edition 2024.",

0.9.\r\n\r\nThe breaking change from 0.8.0 appears to be the addition of a value to a pub enum associated with [TE (terse executable)](https://uefi.org/specs/PI/1.8/V1_TE_Image.html) support; at first glance, it does not look like this should affect cargo-deny\u2019s usage of goblin since it doesn\u2019t match exhaustively on this enum, but it turns out that we do need to add the new `te` feature to the requested `goblin` features in order for the `peek_bytes` API function to be available; see https://github.com/m4b/goblin/blob/d096260201158ed34d64728fd1ab0ca125e2f956/src/lib.rs#L240 and:

- `deny`\r\n- `unmaintained` - `deny`, old default = `warn`\r\n- `unsound` - `deny`, old default = `warn`\r\n- `notice` - `deny`, old default = `warn`\r\n- `severity-threshold` - CVSS severity no

deprecates several fields which will be removed in a future update. I'll explain in detail why below, but the TLDR is that cargo-deny surfaces several configuration options that were added because we _could_, but not necessarily because they are useful in practice.\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\n### [`deny`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/cfg.html#the-allow-and-deny-fields-optional) \r\n\r\nThis field was only added for consistency with `[bans]` but makes no sense for `[licenses]`, if a license you don't explicitly allow is used it is implicitly denied.\r\n\r\n### [`copyleft`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/cfg.html#the-copyleft-field-optional)\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to treat these differently from any other license, if it's not explicitly allowed it should be denied, and it just adds confusion due to the terrible default.\r\n\r\nSee: #602\r\nSee: #354\r\n\r\n### [`allow-osi-fsf-free`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/cfg.html#the-allow-osi-fsf-free-field-optional)\r\n\r\nSimilarly to copyleft, this field just makes no sense and was only added because the SPDX metadata allowed us to query this information.\r\n\r\n### [`default`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/cfg.html#the-default-field-optional)\r\n\r\nThis was added so that users could just ignore/warn all their dependencies not following the set of allowed licenses, but just isn't much value. Even in large projects with literally hundreds of external dependencies the set of licenses that need to be allowed are relatively small compared to the total set of licenses in SPDX due to the Rust ecosystem generally using only a handful of licenses, with rare exceptions.\r\n\r\n### [`unlicensed`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/cfg.html#the-unlicensed-field-optional)\r\n\r\nCrates that don't specify a license via `[package.license/license-file]` or have a license file in their package source are incredibly rare, and there is already a [mechanism](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/cfg.html#the-clarify-field-optional) to provide/override license information for those rare crates.\r\n\r\n## Advisories\r\n\r\n### Blanket\r\n\r\n- [`vulnerability`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/cfg.html#the-vulnerability-field-optional)\r\n- [`unmaintained`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/cfg.html#the-unmaintained-field-optional)\r\n- [`unsound`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/cfg.html#the-unsound-field-optional)\r\n- [`notice`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/cfg.html#the-notice-field-optional)\r\n\r\nThere's no need to blanket handle any of these specific advisory types, there just aren't enough advisories (currently, this could change in the future) that a typical workspace will encounter that they can't be handled explicitly via `ignore`.\r\n\r\nSee: #449\r\n\r\n### [`severity-threshold`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/cfg.html#the-severity-threshold-field-optional)\r\n\r\nThis optional field is available in rustsec advisories, but provides no real value as it's just flavor on top of a reported vulnerability, but doesn't fundamentally change that it is a vulnerability, and can either be ignored or better yet, updated to a version without the vulnerability.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/606/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/606/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/605", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/605/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/605/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/605/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/605", "id": 2144871493, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCxvMOc5na_YQ", "number": 605, "title": "Refactor config", "user": {"login": "Jake-Shadle", "id": 2316028, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTYwMjg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316028?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle", "html_url": "https://github.com/Jake-Shadle", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Jake-Shadle/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-20T17:10:42Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-24T12:47:06Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-20T18:04:53Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pulls/605", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/605", "diff_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/605.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/605.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-20T18:04:53Z"}, "body": "This PR completely refactors the deny configuration, notably:\r\n\r\n### `toml-span`\r\n\r\n`toml-span` is now used for parsing toml files (currently only deny.toml, but eventually cargo manifests as well), replacing `toml`.  This was done so that span information is _always_ available for keys and values if we want to use it, as well as just reducing external dependencies and build times, as serde is no longer used.\r\n\r\n### `PackageSpec`\r\n\r\nSpecifying a package spec via the name + version combo occurs in many locations in the config, but this has verbose in both the simple case, where you just want to specify a crate name (eg. `[bans.deny]`), as well as needing an entire extra key if you _do_ want to specify the version requirement.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it was not possible to specify just a string previously due to toml + serde making us decide between supporting plain strings for package specs, and span information.\r\n\r\nIn all cases (and a few new ones) where the package name + version could be used, now a simple string can be used instead, or, if you want/need to supply additional values as a table, the `crate` key can be used instead which follows a simple format as a single string, instead of the separate name/version keys. `name` and `version` are still supported, but are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### Format\r\n\r\nThe string format of `PackageSpec` is quite simple:\r\n\r\n1. No version - `<crate_name>` = `*`\r\n1. Exact - `<crate_name>@<semver>` = `=<semver>`\r\n2. Requirements - `<crate_name>:<semver_requirements>` = `<semver_requirements>`\r\n\r\n### Add `reason`, `use-instead`\r\n\r\nMany items can now be tagged with a `reason = \"<reason>\"` and/or `use-instead = \"<crate_name>/<url>\"` to add explanatory/helpful messages that are surfaced with diagnostic messages. This was added to fix #578 instead of the typical fallback of relying on toml comments that might not be part of the diagnostic span.\r\n\r\n### `[advisories.ignore]`\r\n\r\nYanked crates can now be ignored by specifying a crate spec + optional reason as a string or table, while still supporting advisory ids.\r\n\r\n### Root table improved\r\n\r\nThe `targets`, `all-features`, `features`, `no-default-features`, `exclude`, and `exclude-dev` keys have been moved to the new `graph` table, as they all affect the dependency graph that cargo-deny performs checks against. The `feature-depth` key has been moved to the `output` table. The old locations are still respected, but are deprecated. Note also that `targets` can now just take a string instead of `triple = <target_triple>`.\r\n\r\nResolves: #264\r\nResolves: #539\r\nResolves: #578\r\nResolves: #579 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/605/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/605/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/603", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/603/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/603/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/603/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/603", "id": 2126838811, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCxvMOc5mdxZZ", "number": 603, "title": "Add pre-commit hook definition", "user": {"login": "mlegner", "id": 5960634, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjA2MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5960634?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlegner", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlegner/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-02-09T10:16:23Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-09T12:31:29Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-09T11:47:57Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pulls/603", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/603", "diff_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/603.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/603.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-09T11:47:57Z"}, "body": "This allows using cargo-deny as a pre-commit hook out of the box.

But I can't think of an alternative that's equal-or-better in correctness short of introducing even more configuration.\r\n\r\n(I suspect that the whole idea of counting path-only or git-only deps as wildcard versions *ever* is wrong, because [the Cargo documentation says](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-path-dependencies) that \u201c\u2026the version key always implies that the package is available in a registry. version, git, and path keys are considered [separate locations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#multiple-locations) for resolving the dependency\u201d \u2014\u00a0which implies that a dep *without* `version` is different from a dep with a wildcard version. However, figuring out Cargo's behavior there and how cargo-deny should treat it feels like a rabbit hole I don't want to go down just to fix #488. I left a TODO comment suggesting further consideration.)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/599/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 3, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/599/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/597", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/597/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/597/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/597/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/597", "id": 2110984696, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCxvMOc5lnlKN", "number": 597, "title": "Explain some caveats in license detection", "user": {"login": "workingjubilee", "id": 46493976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDkzOTc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46493976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee", "html_url": "https://github.com/workingjubilee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-01-31T21:17:35Z", "updated_at": "2024-05-17T01:45:28Z", "closed_at": "2024-02-07T07:40:58Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pulls/597", "html_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/597", "diff_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/597.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/597.patch", "merged_at": "2024-02-07T07:40:58Z"}, "body": "Hi!
