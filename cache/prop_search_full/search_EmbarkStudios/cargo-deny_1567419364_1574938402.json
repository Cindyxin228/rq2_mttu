two ways which this crate uses to discover license\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nThe first method searches for paths starting with \"LICENSE\"\r\nin the root of the current crate.\r\nThe second, uses a path specified by a crate author (in the Cargo.toml,\r\nunder the package table, a license-file can be specified).\r\n\r\nThe paths collected by the first method are absolute.\r\nThe path collected by the second is, however, relative to the crate.\r\n\r\nThe program however expects the paths to be absolute. For example,\r\nin 'get_expression()', paths will be made relative by using the\r\n'strip_prefix' method on the path. If the path is already relative,\r\nas was the case before this commit, the program crashes.\r\n\r\nNow perhaps the bug can also be fixed by making all paths relative,\r\nhowever since I'm not well acquainted with the code base it is difficult\r\nto make such a judgement, and as such this fix seemed safer to me.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have read the [Contributor Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n* [x] I have read and agree to the [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n* [x] I have added a description of my changes and why I'd like them included in the section below\r\n\r\n### Description of Changes\r\n\r\nChanges the license-file as specified by a crate author to be used internally as an absolute path instead of a relative path.\r\n\r\nI'd like them included because I use these kinds of paths in my [sic](https://github.com/foresterre/sic) program and would like to keep using them.

dependency graph for any crate that fails license checks.
