This means that, with the approach used in https://github.com/cloudflare/foundations/pull/60, code calling enable_syscall_sandboxing would get an error because seccomp is already active if it happened to be running inside a docker container - even though it could still safely call enable_syscall_sandboxing.\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/cloudflare/foundations/pull/60, the original motivation for that change was because of the use of the [tokio::runtime::Builder::on_thread_start](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/struct.Builder.html#method.on_thread_start) hook leading to double seccomp initialization. This hook was used to ensure that any threads initialized before seccomp is configured on the main thread also had seccomp active, but it led to a risk of double seccomp initialization leading to a crash.\r\n\r\nThis PR rolls back most of the changes in #60, instead simply exposing the `get_current_thread_seccomp_mode` method so applications can decide for themselves how to handle these scenarios. In our case, we'll use it to log a warning if we're about to enable seccomp and it's already enabled.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

This constrained the design and made things grosser than they might otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that we're already in the situation where the next release we do is going to need to be a major version bump, *anyway*. So we might as well revisit this, and do it the less-gross way that (slightly) breaks API compatibility.\r\n\r\nWe can minimize the extent to which we break API compatibility by having slog_logger() return a `Arc<RwLock<impl Deref<Target = Logger>>>`. This is nearly the same thing as it used to be.\r\n\r\nThis PR consists of two commits; one that reverts PR #47, and one that puts the functionality back in the new way. If you are reviewing it, you can either review the PR as a whole (which will show you the diff vs current main branch) or you can review only the second of the two commits (which will show you the diff vs how things looked prior to PR #47).

This function, as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.rs/socket2/latest/socket2/struct.Socket.html#method.set_reuse_port) is only available under \"Unix and neither Solaris nor illumos\". This PR ensures that this line is only ran on targets where it is supported. This allows `metrics` to be used on e.g. Windows. This does change the behaviour between unix and non-unix systems, so if another solutions is prefered please feel free to suggest! To note: According to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14388706/how-do-so-reuseaddr-and-so-reuseport-differ), Windows with only `SO_REUSEADDR`, set by the line above, behaves close to exactly the same as BSD with both `SO_REUSEPORT` and `SO_REUSEADDR`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cloudflare/foundations/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cloudflare/foundations/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
