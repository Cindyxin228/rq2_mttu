[`server.rs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/foundations/blob/8409e9186c9b98afd690f884b4a00ca5779f5c55/foundations/src/telemetry/server.rs#L138) the `socket2::Socket::set_reuse_port` function is used. This function, as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.rs/socket2/latest/socket2/struct.Socket.html#method.set_reuse_port) is only available under \"Unix and neither Solaris nor illumos\". This PR ensures that this line is only ran on targets where it is supported. This allows `metrics` to be used on e.g. Windows. This does change the behaviour between unix and non-unix systems, so if another solutions is prefered please feel free to suggest! To note: According to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14388706/how-do-so-reuseaddr-and-so-reuseport-differ), Windows with only `SO_REUSEADDR`, set by the line above, behaves close to exactly the same as BSD with both `SO_REUSEPORT` and `SO_REUSEADDR`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cloudflare/foundations/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cloudflare/foundations/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
