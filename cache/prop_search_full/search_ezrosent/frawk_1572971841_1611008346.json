You can now skip the header line by passing the `-H` flag and then access fields by name by looking up the column name in new builtin `FI` variable. The core challenge here is to integrate the new `FI`-related functionality  _without_ completely trivializing the fields inferred in the projection pushdown analysis.\r\n\r\nI went about this by adding to the constant string analysis already used to eliminate regex lookups to gathering a set of strings passed as keys to `FI`. We need corresponding changes in the used field analysis to ensure we \"look the other way\" when accessing a field that comes from a value in `FI`. After all of that is done, special runtime primitives munge the relevant column indexes gleaned from the header line into the used field set we are using at runtime. This avoids complicated schemes where we run custom logic on the first line of input before yielding control back to the frawk program.\r\n\r\nAll of this was complicated by the fact that I discovered some soundness issues in the existing dataflow analyses that had been implemented so far. This PR includes fixes and tests for those issues, and unifies the implementations in a common framework so that future bugs will only have to be fixed once.", "reactions": {"url":

This analysis is optional, but it is an opt-out.\r\n* frawk currently models reading from commands similarly to how it models reading from files. Among other things, that means that there isn't support for reading from commands in some of the more optimized code-paths (such as CSV, TSV) from a subshell; those use-cases still  have to be passed through stdin.

Indeed, tight loops, particularly those involving maps, are a good deal slower on this branch (sometimes 20-40% slower). However, since I now anticipate compute-bound scripts will use the LLVM backend, I do not think this poses a huge problem.
