the API (preferring an `std::iter::Iterator` over a getter with explicit indices, that must be bound-checked)\r\n* This improves performance by:\r\n    * efficiently caching \"constant\" data (i.e. that does not depend on a given `EVENT_RECORD`), so that it can be reused over various `EVENT_RECORD`s.\r\n    * avoiding cloning some structures\r\n* This adds a \"Property not found\" error, and fixes #38 (I was too lazy to extract this commit outside of this MR, as it would quickly conflict with other branches)\r\n* This is one step towards a better multi-threading capability of this crate,

Windows will give back as argument of the callback This points at `UserTrace.data`, which previously lived on the stack. This means that moving the UserTrace (e.g. by returning it in a function result) would break the pointer. This is fixed by putting UserTrace.data on the heap. It is now the responsability of the ferrisetw developer (and not its user, who was unaware of it) to *not* move it.\r\n\r\nThis changes the public API, so this means this should be released as a new
