However we have a problem with `birdc::Error` which does not implement `std::error::Error`, which makes it hard to use and compose with our error types. I've quickly implemented `std::error:Error` and `std::fmt::Display` for it. We would greatly appreciate if you could merge this changes and release new version we could use.\r\n\r\nI don't know this library very well yet, so please look if implementation of `Display` is done correctly. Especially `Error::ProtocolError` variant.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amodm/birdc-rs/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amodm/birdc-rs/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
