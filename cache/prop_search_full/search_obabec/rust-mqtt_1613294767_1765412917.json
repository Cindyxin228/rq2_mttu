"https://github.com/obabec/rust-mqtt/pull/47.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-13T08:10:43Z"}, "body": "My understanding is that `NoMatchingSubscribers` indicates that the broker received a QoS1 or QoS2 message and handled it correctly, but there were no subscribers. So this isn't really an error, more a \"warn/info\" - I believe it's also optional, so some brokers may return success even when there are no subscribers.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `RawMqttClient` handled any puback packet with `NoMatchingSubscribers` by returning an error - this loses the packet identifier. This in turn prevents higher level clients from working properly - they should expect to receive every puback, even with `NoMatchingSubscribers` set, so that they know the broker has received the message and it does not need to be resent as part of QoS1/2 handling. They might have separate additional logic to respond to the `NoMatchingSubscribers` reason code, e.g. tell a user that messages are not being subscribed to, so this is useful data but not an error.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1. Add a boolean field to `Event.Puback`, this is true if there were subscribers (reason code was `Success`), false otherwise (reason code was `NoMatchingSubscribers`). This is a breaking change to users of `RawMqttClient` - they must check the new field if they want to respond to the case where there are no matching subscribers. I did wonder about making this a struct-like variant, but since the others are all tuples I've left it this way for now.\r\n2. Neaten up the code in `RawMqttClient` to make it clearer how the packet data is used and avoid a (safe) unwrap and multiple returns.\r\n3. Update `MqttClient` to check the extra field in `Event.Puback`, and if there are no matching subscribers convert this back to an `Err(NoMatchingSubscribers)`. I think this means that users of `MqttClient` shouldn't see any changes.\r\n\r\nFixes #46 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/issues/47/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/issues/47/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/issues/45", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/issues/45/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/issues/45/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/issues/45/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/obabec/rust-mqtt/pull/45", "id": 2639064148, "node_id": "PR_kwDOGxpnrs6BGeXG", "number": 45, "title": "Fix index out of bouds error", "user": {"login": "andoriyu", "id": 148123, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODEyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148123?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu", "html_url": "https://github.com/andoriyu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andoriyu/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-11-06T19:45:38Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-13T08:10:30Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-13T08:10:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/obabec/rust-mqtt/pulls/45", "html_url": "https://github.com/obabec/rust-mqtt/pull/45", "diff_url": "https://github.com/obabec/rust-mqtt/pull/45.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/obabec/rust-mqtt/pull/45.patch", "merged_at": "2025-09-13T08:10:29Z"}, "body": "Noticed that when I juse large MQTT payloads (i.e. larger than link MTU) writting to recv_buffer causes errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR ====================== PANIC ====================== \u2514\u2500 <mod> @ \u2514\u2500 <invalid location: defmt frame-index: 81>:0 ERROR panicked at /home/andoriyu/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/rust-mqtt-0.3.0/src/client/raw_client.rs:538:48: range end index 66788 out of range for slice of length 64000</mod>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndex values I was getting made no sense: I knew the exact size of a MQTT notification and it was smaller than 66788.
