All `virt_` funcs have no prefix, and for instance, `virt_read` becomes just `read`. This is because these functions also work on physical memory accesses, and other custom views.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are just 3 primary traits an user would interact most with: `Os`, `Process`, `MemoryView`.\r\n\r\nOptionally, there is `VirtualTranslate`, which is available only with DMA, and `PhysicalMemory`, which is the first thing available on DMA, but it is not meant to be used.\r\n\r\nDid not auto-impl `MemoryView` on `PhysicalMemory`, because of conflicting implementations with CGlue. Instead, there are 2 functions - `phys_view`, and `into_phys_view` to create a `MemoryView` out of a `PhysicalMemory` object. I think this is good, because that allows an OS to have a default virtual memory view, and then optionally provide a secondary physical memory view. I believe physical memory lies kinda not in OS' control so it makes sense. A thing to note is that `CGlue` helper is not being generated for these functions - an alternative way to acquire phys mem view needs to be provided, perhaps through the FFI-lib.\r\n\r\n`PhysicalMemory` was not removed, because it is the interface connectors implement. While it could be possible to fully merge the traits through associated types, I believe it is not worth it, because they have slight variations in them, and user experience might be a little confused.\r\n\r\n`MemoryView` can be extended with structures that allow to build additional views on top of each other. Think isolating a slice of emulator memory, perhaps even re-mapping pages, and then performing reads inside the emulated address space. I think this change is also necessary for sane nested introspection.\r\n\r\nFinally, there should be some efficiency improvements, because the core read/write data stream is an iterator, which would allow for streamed reads.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/memflow/memflow/issues/67/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0,

changes throughout. Most notably, removal of some old traits, addition of more general traits and structures, renames of functions to be more general, removal of old interfaces.\r\n\r\nBiggest breaking change: removal of `memflow-win32-ffi`. All previous functionality and more will be provided by `memflow-ffi`.\r\nAnother big change is removal of `memflow::process` module. It was replaced with a much simpler mechanism in the `memflow::os` module.\r\n\r\nIn memflow-win32, `Kernel`, `KernelBuilder`, and `KernelInfo` were renamed to `Win32Kernel`, `Win32KernelBuilder`, and `Win32KernelInfo`.\r\n\r\nAdded generic traits: `OSInner`, `OS`, `Process`.\r\n`OS` provides all functionality that a generic OS would provide: access to processes, as well as optional features like keyboard input, physical/kernel virtual memory access. It does not limit itself to be based on DMA, and a `Kernel` could in theory be implemented as an abstraction for native OS APIs. Applications are endless, and include: clean nested introspection.\r\n`OS` is a supertrait of `OSInner`. It is needed, because `OSInner` accepts lifetime `'a`, which can only be removed once GAT (Generic Associated Types) are available.\r\n`Process` abstracts away a single process. It provides: virtual memory access, module list, basic process information.\r\n\r\nProcesses and modules are now described in a simple C compatible way: `ProcessInfo`, and `ModuleInfo` structs.
