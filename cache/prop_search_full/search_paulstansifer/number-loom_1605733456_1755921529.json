The user can now select between a pencil tool and a flood fill tool.\n\n- The pencil tool allows drawing on the canvas by clicking and dragging, which was the previous default behavior.\n- The flood fill tool allows filling a contiguous area of the same color with the selected color by clicking on it.\n\nA `Tool` enum was introduced to manage the current drawing tool, and the UI was updated with buttons to switch between tools.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paulstansifer/number-loom/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/paulstansifer/number-loom/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
