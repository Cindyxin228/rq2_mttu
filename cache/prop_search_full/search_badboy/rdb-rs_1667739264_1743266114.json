Python library[ redis-rbd-tools](https://github.com/sripathikrishnan/redis-rdb-tools) is outdated and doesn't support newer redis versions and this one was long archived but promising. So I went ahead and added support for new encoding types, refactored the code and added python bindings with Maturin. \r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n - New RDB version and Datatypes\r\n - Rust based integration tests\r\n - Fixtures for protocol and plain output\r\n - Redis integration test covering 6.2 - 7.4\r\n - Option to output to file\r\n - Error handling with thiserror\r\n - Support for new encoding types:\r\n    - listpack\r\n    - quicklist\r\n    - sorted set v2\r\n - Python bindings with Maturin\r\n\r\nContributing this here as part of a bid to become maintainer of this project. Thanks again for the nice chat leading up to this!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/badboy/rdb-rs/issues/19/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/badboy/rdb-rs/issues/19/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
