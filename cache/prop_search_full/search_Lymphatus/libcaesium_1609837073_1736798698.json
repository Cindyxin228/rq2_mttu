E.g. caesium-clt has also a `display_error`, then when libcaesium calls  `display_error`, the one from caesium-clt was called.\r\n\r\nThere are also other solutions,\r\n\r\n1. Using compiler/linker-specific options\r\nFor example, with the GCC extension, `__attribute__ ((visibility (\"hidden\")))` hides the function. Alternatively it is possible to pass a list of functions to be exported.  See also: https://developer.ibm.com/articles/au-aix-symbol-visibility/\r\n\r\nHowever, this fashion is compiler/linker-specific, so that will lead to nightmare maintenance troubles. One thousand configuration for one thousand compilers.\r\n\r\n2. Code amalgamation. This technique is used by sqlite, where 100+ source files were merged into a single 7.5MB 220,000+ LOC `sqlite3.c` by script, then symbols not desired to be exported can just be marked `static`. See also: https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html\r\n\r\nI believe this may be the best option, however I am too lazy for it. :)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Lymphatus/libcaesium/issues/10/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Lymphatus/libcaesium/issues/10/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
