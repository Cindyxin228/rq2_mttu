deserialize a property we expect to be 64 bits and it's actually 32 bits, we can safely convert over.\r\n\r\nThis fixes issues where Roblox previously had values serialized as 32 bits, but then they got upgraded to 64 bits later on. This only really occurs in older files, but it's a good blanket fix to have regardless.\r\n\r\nThere might be a better solution with migrations but I'm not as familiar with that; we can always remove this change if that gets figured out. I don't think this will break anything, unless Roblox goes from 64 back to 32 for a value and rbx_dom doesn't update in time, though that doesn't seem very likely. It's more likely that this will automatically migrate a value if Roblox changes something from 32 bits to 64.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #301, and rbx_xml's fix is tracked in #303.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything else I need to change! I wanted to make a test for this, but I couldn't figure out how to get a binary file in the wrong format other than my repo file, and it looks like the file resolutions paths are broken on my cursed Cygwin setup, so I couldn't run any tests.

Approach 1 as described in the issue. I ended up having to touch `WeakDom::transfer` as well, because that method could also create collisions.\r\n\r\nIt feels a bit icky to hard code the property name in these checks, but it's *very* unlikely that we or Roblox will ever want to give it a different name.\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally changes `WeakDom::insert` to accept a none `Ref` for the parent (previously, it'd just fall over and panic). The reason why is that I wanted to reuse the `UniqueId` checking code in `WeakDom::new` (to uphold the invariant even when the prop is in the root builder), but `WeakDom::insert` did not allow a none parent. The only difference for insertions with none parent vs some parent is whether the parent's list of children is extended, so it's pretty minimal & I think it makes sense.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/288/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/288/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/287", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/287/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/287/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/287/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/287", "id": 1761672686, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCUtmo85TPxnc", "number": 287, "title": "Fix write_interleaved_bytes so that it actually writes interleaved", "user": {"login": "kennethloeffler", "id": 13822714, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNzE0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822714?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler", "html_url": "https://github.com/kennethloeffler", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennethloeffler/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-06-17T06:29:21Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T22:11:49Z", "closed_at": "2023-06-19T19:13:04Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pulls/287", "html_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/287", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/287.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/287.patch", "merged_at": "2023-06-19T19:13:04Z"}, "body": "write_interleaved_bytes fails right now because it's just writing the bytes in their original sequence (see the results [here](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/actions/runs/5296791237/jobs/9588138111))!

that the issue was with our implementation of `Serializate` in `BinaryString`.\r\n\r\nWe're currently using `serialize_bytes` to serialize the internal buffer of it, and using `<Vec<u8>>::deserialize` to deserialize it. This was fine for a while but after upgrading to `rmp-serde` version `1.1.1`, it has broken. After giving it some thought I've realized that our implementation is outright wrong because we're assuming `Vec<u8>` and `&[u8]` serialize the same. A lot of the time this is true, but it won't always be, so we should stop making that assumption.\r\n\r\nThis PR does just that and instead makes it so we just use `Vec<u8>`'s serialize and deserialize implementations. It's easy to implement a `Visitor` and continue to use `serialize_bytes` but that ends up being a lot of code that we don't need to have. The cost to the database does not exist (I checked) so there's no downside.\r\n\r\nI've also included a new and upgraded database so that nobody else has to go through the process of updating. This comes with a few snapshot changes but nothing surprising (I am horrified to learn we weren't tracking things like `ChildData` though).", "reactions": {"url":

I also have some general questions and concerns:\r\n* The Font value I saw in a hex editor looked different from what rbx-dom would output. Does rbx-dom do some transformation on all binary property data to make them sense? Maybe I didn't read deep enough about it. Should I have included information about that in my documentation of the Font type?\r\n* The Font type has a u8 and u16 which act a lot like enums but aren't exactly enums. I made special types for these with support for an `Other` so that any new items should _just work_ even if they're not nicely represented.  Was this the correct move? I could have represented Weight with just a u16, but Style needs a u8 <-> name converter so that it can be serialized to/from xml.\r\n* The FontStyle type serializes to xml by name, but to binary as u8. I included an `Other` enum variant here since I figured having support for unknown new values was a good thing, _but that was before I saw how xml did it_. This means unknown new FontStyles can go from binary -> binary, but not binary -> xml or xml -> anything. Is this okay, or do we want to remove the `Other` variant here? Related: in cases where the variant is unknown, I default to `Normal`. Would it be better to error?\r\n* The default font style I have listed is unstyled Source Sans Pro. This matches the default when you make a new object in Studio, but _not_ the default when loading a type in Studio that's missing the Font property. Studio will actually give TextLabels (and such) that are missing the Font property and unstyled _Arial_ font. Should that be our default, or should Source Sans Pro be our default?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/248/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/248/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/247", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/247/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/247/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/issues/247/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/247", "id": 1533168343, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCUtmo85HYC2q", "number": 247, "title": "Fill out XML spec document", "user": {"login": "Dekkonot", "id": 4625546, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjU1NDY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4625546?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dekkonot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dekkonot/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-01-14T07:18:22Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-23T17:05:15Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-28T01:51:32Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pulls/247", "html_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/247", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/247.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/pull/247.patch", "merged_at": "2023-04-28T01:51:32Z"}, "body": "Wrote out a spec file for the XML file format since it's long overdue.
