would be the subject of the snapshot function if a change occurred to any of the contributing paths.\r\n\r\nNow, none of the members of `contributing_paths` are special, and the snapshot function instead looks at `instigating_source`, a new metadata member for this purpose that is either a path or a project node + name pair.", "reactions": {"url":
