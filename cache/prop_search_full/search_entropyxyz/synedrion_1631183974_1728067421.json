Specifically, REDIST protocol.\r\n\r\nInternal:\r\n- Switched from using `HoleVec` to `BTreeMap` when accumulating messages from other nodes.\r\n- Added a `Finalizable` trait to handle tasks or checking whether the round can be finalized, and if not, whose messages are missing. (see #85)\r\n- Added `num_parties()` and `party_idx()` methods to `Round`\r\n- Added `ShareIdx` type (a part of #31, decoupling `PartyIdx` from the share index)\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

MessagePack results in an inefficient encoding of `Uint` values (see https://github.com/RustCrypto/formats/pull/1112, it is currently merged but will take some time to propagate); also Bincode is already used by `entropy-core`.\r\n- Pack `Signed` values before serializing. They are bounded, and the bound is often much smaller than the full size of the integer, so we now serialize only the actual significant bytes.\r\n- The change above leads to a slight variation in message sizes because `Signed::random_bounded_bits_scaled()` could produce numbers with a slightly different bound (because the `scale` is the RSA modulus, which can be either `PRIME_BITS * 2` or `PRIME_BITS * 2 - 1` in size, depending on the value of the RSA primes). This PR changes it to always produce a number with a fixed bound. \r\n\r\nFor reference, the message sizes after this PR are:\r\n- Keygen & Aux: 80b, 42kb, 65kb\r\n- Presigning + Signing: 1kb/2kb, 11kb, 2kb, 40b\r\n\r\nThe reduction is 1.5x-2x compared to the base of the PR (mainly due to replacing MessagePack with Bincode; the packing is much less impactful since most of the size is taken by unbounded integers).

The errors we get can fall under the following categories:\r\n- Usage errors or library bugs. These are returned as `LocalError` or `Error::Local`, and the user code can't really do much with them besides logging them and halting the protocol execution (or the whole application).\r\n- Provable faults of a single party (e.g. a signed malformed message or an invalid proof within a message). These are returned as `Error::Provable` (TODO: attach the implicating messages with them) and can be published to prove that a node with a given `Verifier` misbehaved.\r\n- Proofs of the correct execution of a protocol. These are returned as `Error::Proof` when the protocol could identify that an error occurred, but couldn't pinpoint the guilty party. Then some independent observer (or each node) must collect these proofs from each participating node, and at least one of them will be either malformed or not provided, thus pointing at the guilty party.\r\n- Unprovable faults of a remote node, e.g. invalid signature or a duplicate message. These can have more or less weight depending on the guarantees of the message delivery channel, so the course of action is chosen by the user code.
