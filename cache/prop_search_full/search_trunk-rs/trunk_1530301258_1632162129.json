For the last few weeks I've been working axum 0.2 which cleans up and improves pretty much all parts of axum. There is a number of breaking changes as well. Everything is detailed in our [changelog](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\nWhile axum 0.2 isn't shipped yet, all the API level changes are done. I expect to `cargo publish` next week. As part of that I'm going through crates on crates.io to make sure everything still works on 0.2.\r\n\r\nThis PR currently uses a git dependency but once 0.2 is shipped then I'll remove that and depend directly on 0.2 from crates.io. Hence the draft PR.\r\n\r\nThanks for using axum!

Probably error handling around that area should be improved to make error messages clearer?\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/224/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/224/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/221/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221", "id": 962944487, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzA1NjYwMjcz", "number": 221, "title": "Add hooks", "user": {"login": "techninja1008", "id": 4208789, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDg3ODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4208789?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008", "html_url": "https://github.com/techninja1008", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/techninja1008/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2021-08-06T18:08:19Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-20T01:48:31Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-20T01:48:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/pulls/221", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221", "diff_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/221.patch", "merged_at": "2021-08-20T01:48:30Z"}, "body": "Hi all.

The main takeaway is that we now have two kinds of `dist` directory: staging and final. Plugins should output to staging, and Trunk itself moves things from staging to final. In theory, a plugin could put files in final itself which is pretty undesirable. If we move to untrusted plugins, this might be a good action to restrict.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [ ] Updated README.md with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/108/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/108/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/107", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/107/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/107/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/107/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/107", "id": 788536959, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU3MDMwMjYx", "number": 107, "title": "Run `cargo fmt`", "user": {"login": "philip-peterson", "id": 1326208, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjYyMDg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1326208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson", "html_url": "https://github.com/philip-peterson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philip-peterson/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-01-18T20:44:23Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-23T18:22:03Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-23T18:22:03Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/pulls/107", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/107", "diff_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/107.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/107.patch", "merged_at": "2021-01-23T18:22:03Z"}, "body": "This PR runs cargo fmt to apply some changes not caught by CI.

The main focus is on inlining raw HTML. But you can also inline CSS and JavaScript (without compression).\r\n\r\nThe new inline pipeline allows including the content of files directly into `index.html`. Just add `<link data-trunk rel=\"inline\" href=\"path/to/file\">` to the position in your `index.html` where the content of the files should be placed, and you're good to go. There are three content types available: `html`, `css`, and `js`. `html` is pasted into `index.html` as is, `css` is wrapped in `style` tags and `js` is wrapped in `script` tags.\r\nThe type can be specified with the `type` attribute. If not specified, it's inferred from the file extension.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n````css\r\n/* path/to/file.css */\r\nheader {\r\n    color: blue;\r\n}\r\n````\r\n````html\r\n<!-- path/to/file.html -->\r\n<header>LOGO</header>\r\n````\r\n````js\r\n// path/to/file.js\r\nalert(\"Hello Trunk\");\r\n````\r\n````html\r\n<!-- index.html -->\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n        <title>Inline

rebuild loop. \r\n\r\n![trunk_infinite_loop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18517402/96332710-d9fe6000-1065-11eb-8e5a-155b75518cd3.gif)\r\n\r\n**Cause:**\r\nhttps://github.com/thedodd/trunk/blob/fdef076e05cad6b89e597b1ed2f33bce9b01c786/src/watch.rs#L87-L91\r\n\r\nPaths `p` (_ignored path_) and `path` (_event path_) are often incorrectly evaluated as different, because some paths aren't canonicalized/normalized. As the result, events coming from ignored folders `dist` and `target` were handled and their content changed again by Trunk. Those changes caused firing new events and the cycle repeated.\r\n\r\nExamples of such paths (`p` and `path` wrapped in `println!`):\r\n```\r\n...\r\n____\r\nIGNORED PATH: \"C:\\\\work\\\\repos\\\\stremio-seed-poc\\\\target\"\r\nEVENT PATH: \"C:\\\\work\\\\repos\\\\stremio-seed-poc\\\\.\\\\target\"\r\n____\r\nIGNORED PATH: \"\\\\\\\\?\\\\C:\\\\work\\\\repos\\\\stremio-seed-poc\\\\dist\"\r\nEVENT PATH: \"C:\\\\work\\\\repos\\\\stremio-seed-poc\\\\.\\\\dist\"\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Path with `target` is added through the _ignore channel_ during the build from manifest's metadata.\r\nhttps://github.com/thedodd/trunk/blob/fdef076e05cad6b89e597b1ed2f33bce9b01c786/src/config/manifest.rs#L23\r\n\r\n- Paths with dot (`\\\\.\\\\`) are created by watcher:\r\nhttps://github.com/thedodd/trunk/blob/fdef076e05cad6b89e597b1ed2f33bce9b01c786/src/watch.rs#L108\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nCanonicalize/normalize all paths coming to the ignored path resolver.\r\n\r\nI tried to canonicalize paths as soon as possible in this PR to prevent unnecessary extra `canonicalize` calls. However it's still possible, for instance, to pass \"raw\" paths through _ignore channel_ to reintroduce the similar issue.\r\n\r\nSo working with paths seems to be quite error-prone. I'm not sure there is an universal solution - e.g. introduce a custom `path` wrapper that would implicitly normalize all paths.", "reactions": {"url":

such:\r\n`<link data-trunk rel=\"rust|sass|...\" data-attr0 data-attr1/>`.\r\nThe links may appear anywhere in the HTML and Trunk will process them and\r\nreplace them or delete them based on the associated pipeline's output.\r\nIf the link element does not have the `data-trunk` attribute, it will not\r\nbe processed.\r\n\r\nThe `--manifest-path` flag has been removed in favor of the new link\r\nstyle: `<link data-trunk rel=\"rust\" href=\"path/to/Cargo.toml\"/>`. This is optional,\r\nand will default to the Cargo.toml of the source HTML's parent dir if\r\nnot specified.\r\n\r\nUpdate README describing new asset pipeline declaration pattern.\r\n\r\ncloses #50\r\ncloses #72 \r\n\r\n### todo\r\n- [x] ensure HTML pipelines replace their source HTML element. If declared in the `head`, then it should be replaced there, if declared in the `body` then it should be replaced there.\r\n- [x] update README describing new functionality.\r\n- [x] update README to clarify that when `data-trunk` links are processed, their HTML will be replaced based on where they exist in the DOM. So if links need to appear in the HTML body for including the WASM/JS, adding the `data-trunk` link to the HTML body will solve that problem.\r\n- [x] update docs for `rust-worker` asset type. The `href` attr should behave exactly as it does for the `rust` asset type.\r\n\r\n### for anyone willing to review\r\nPlease take a look at [the rendered README file](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/blob/804c3909f395b0f6db0472a90c542078b6dd8efd/README.md). The main thing which needs review/feedback here is the pattern which I've landed on for declaring assets (which is mostly discussed in the **assets** section of the README).", "reactions": {"url":
