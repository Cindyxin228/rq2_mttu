[lol_html](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html).\r\n\r\nThe `nipper::Document` struct that was used in various parts of the application is now replaced with Trunk's own `Document` struct, that has various ease of use methods to mask the `lol_html::HtmlRewriter` and its caveats. \r\n\r\n## Fixes:\r\n - https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/742\r\n - Possibly a few other stuff mentioned in `nipper`'s [issues](https://github.com/importcjj/nipper/issues).\r\n\r\nAny of the tests mentioned are run locally on my Ryzen 5 5600 CPU, so take the performance results with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n## Compile time:\r\n`lol_html` taking longer to compile was consistent across multiple runs.\r\n| Used dependency | duration |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| lol_html | 3m 12s |\r\n| nipper | 3m 08s | \r\n\r\n## Runtime:\r\nTested on `yew-tailwindcss`, `no-rust`, and `yew` examples.\r\nResults were within margin of error, both were pretty much the same.\r\nMight do more runtime testing later.\r\n\r\n## Notes:  \r\nI believe the change will be better in the long term, as issues due to `nipper` might keep popping up in the long run.\r\nThat being said, the replacement `html_lol` does have some down sides. It is heavily intended for streaming HTML, and not reading a String directly, which causes the API to be a bit weird for our use case. I think this could be turned into an performance advantage with various changes to Trunk in the future.

Implement an \"update check\", so that trunk can let you know that there's a newer version available.\r\n\r\nThe update check can be disabled by disabling the feature `update_check`.

revealed that std::fs::copy will generate modification events on the source file (the file being copied) on some platforms. This has proven to be a source of difficulty for the FS watcher, and has lead to infinite build loops, despite the fact that none of the files / directories being watched were actually changed.\r\n\r\nHere we implement a post-build cooldown interval of 1s. This ensures that in very fast builds, we do not end up receiving a modification event due to std::fs::copy (from the copy source).\r\n\r\nMoreover, any FS events which have accumulated during the 1s cooldown will be purged. Altogether this will hopefully fully address the recursive build issue, and will hopefully not disrupt the development workflow.\r\n\r\n**Related Issues**\r\n- closes https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/issues/588\r\n- extends https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/569\r\n- closes https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/issues/461\r\n- closes https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/issues/422\r\n- closes https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/516\r\n- closes https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/459\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [x] Updated README.md with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/593/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/593/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/592", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/592/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/592/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/592/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/592", "id": 1858115320, "node_id": "PR_kwDOETa5UM5YUjfO", "number": 592, "title": "Remove HTML glob in example tailwind.config.js", "user": {"login": "0e4ef622", "id": 8326135, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjYxMzU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326135?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622", "html_url": "https://github.com/0e4ef622", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/0e4ef622/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5299103389, "node_id": "LA_kwDOETa5UM8AAAABO9nmnQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/labels/disposition:merge", "name": "disposition:merge", "color": "2BB245", "default": false, "description": "The tagged item should probably be merged"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-08-20T12:54:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-22T15:17:38Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-22T15:17:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/pulls/592", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/592", "diff_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/592.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/592.patch", "merged_at": "2023-08-22T15:17:38Z"}, "body": "I copied this example for a project, but the `**/*.html` pattern was likely causing tailwind to scan the `target` directory making builds unreasonably slow.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [x] Updated README.md with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [x] Updated `site` content with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [x] Squash down commits to one or two logical commits which clearly describe the work you've done.

If you don't, then Dodd will \ud83e\udd13.\n\nWe currently have a few open security advisories, most prominently the use of `wee_alloc`. None of the advisories are actually targeted towards the main `trunk` binary, but instead in the examples. Still good to bump trunks deps as well, to stay up to date.\n\nAll examples are a bit old in regards to dependencies, so all were bumped to the latest, and I unified the version scheme used (was a mix of `0.1.1` vs `0.1` and `1.0.0` vs `1` and so on). Personally prefer to use the full version requirement, but we already use the short versions in trunk itself, so its all consistent.\n\nOnly thing that's outstanding is the bump from **yew** v0.18 to v0.19. The `yew-tailwindcss` example can probably be updated easily, but I prefer to do that as separate PR. For the `yew` example, we might consider removing `ybc` in favor of a non-framework implementation, as it's not actively developed anymore?\n\n### Further notes\n\nIt seems the `notify` v5 is finally out, and has moved debouncing logic into a separate crate. I didn't update it as part of this PR, as we had lots of forth and back with that crate in the past. Probably best to do extensive testing when we update this, as it can cause quite some potential trouble.\n\nThe v4 to v5 docs recommend also, that it's best for the app to check a file's content when receiving an update, so we might just combine that with other ideas of avoiding re-compilation of code on each event.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/436/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/436/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/430", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/430/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/430/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/issues/430/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/430", "id": 1367147391, "node_id": "PR_kwDOETa5UM4-pMCn", "number": 430, "title": "Pass attrs through on script tags", "user": {"login": "k3d3", "id": 1247908, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDc5MDg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1247908?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3", "html_url": "https://github.com/k3d3", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/k3d3/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2022-09-09T01:00:42Z", "updated_at": "2022-09-09T01:27:06Z", "closed_at": "2022-09-09T01:27:06Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/trunk-rs/trunk/pulls/430", "html_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/430", "diff_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/430.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/pull/430.patch", "merged_at": "2022-09-09T01:27:06Z"}, "body": "<!--\r\nThank you for taking the time to open a pull request!\r\nPlease review the checklist below and perform each of\r\nthe applicable tasks. \u2764\ufe0f!\r\n-->\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [ ] Updated README.md with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [ ] Updated `site` content with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [X] Squash down commits to one or two logical commits which clearly describe the work you've done.
