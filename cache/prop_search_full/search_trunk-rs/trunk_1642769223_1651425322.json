I took some inspiration from it, but I ended up with a different design that solves some of the questions joshyrobot raised. \r\n\r\nInstead of a separate `rel=\"rust-worker\"` asset type, which duplicates a lot of attributes and code, I made a `data-type` attribute for `rel=\"rust\"` which can be either `main` or `worker`. For backwards compatibility reasons I made `main` the default, even though it complicates the code a bit. Workers are built with `wasm-bindgen --no-modules`, and a small wrapper is included that loads the hashed module. The wrapper is named after the binary name if provided, otherwise the project name. I have also used this name to make the logs and file names clearer, as it got confusing fast when multiple modules were named `index-{hash}`.\r\n\r\nMy use case for this is for use in a yew project. I have tested it with a private yew project, but annoyingly it requires a PR to yew as well, to tell it to use the trunk generated wrapper instead of creating a new one. I'll probably create that one if some variant of this PR gets merged.\r\n\r\nFeel free to bikeshed both the design and implementation. I suspect there might be considerations related to e.g. #203 and the issues it links that are relevant to this.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md describing pertinent changes.\r\n- [x] Updated README.md with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [x] Updated `site` content with pertinent info (may not always apply).\r\n- [x] Squash down commits to one or two logical commits which clearly describe the work you've done.
