that controls the behavior of the PROXY v2 encoder (if `--proxy` is also set).\r\n\r\nThe PROXY v2 protocol supports [encoding additional TLVs] after the address block:\r\n\r\n    If the length specified in the PROXY protocol header indicates that\r\n    additional bytes are part of the header beyond the address\r\n    information, a receiver may choose to skip over and ignore those\r\n    bytes, or attempt to interpret those bytes.\r\n\r\n    The information in those bytes will be arranged in Type-Length-Value\r\n    (TLV vectors) in the following format. The first byte is the Type of\r\n    the vector. The second two bytes represent the length in bytes of\r\n    the value (not included the Type and Length bytes), and following\r\n    the length field is the number of bytes specified by the length.\r\n\r\n            struct pp2_tlv {\r\n                uint8_t type;\r\n                uint8_t length_hi;\r\n                uint8_t length_lo;\r\n                uint8_t value[0];\r\n            };\r\n\r\n    A receiver may choose to skip over and ignore the TLVs it is not\r\n    interested in or it does not understand. Senders can generate the\r\n    TLVs only for the information they choose to publish.\r\n\r\nAdditional, there is a range of TLV codepoints [reserved for application-specific data]:\r\n\r\n    The following range of 16 type values is reserved for\r\n    application-specific data and will be never used by the PROXY\r\n    Protocol. If you need more values consider extending the range with\r\n    a type field in your TLVs.\r\n\r\n            #define PP2_TYPE_MIN_CUSTOM    0xE0\r\n            #define PP2_TYPE_MAX_CUSTOM    0xEF\r\n\r\nThis commit uses the codepoint 0xEA for dnstap-replay's PROXY v2 timespec TLV. This TLV represents the timestamp at which the original DNS response was processed. This allows the DNS server under test (receiving replayed DNS queries with prepended PROXY v2 headers) to recover the original timestamp of the DNS query, which allows for testing time-dependent behavior. Because of buffering and processing latency, etc. there can be a small but non-negligible amount of delay (up to a few seconds) between when the original DNS server responds to the original query and when the DNS server under test processes the replayed DNS query.\r\n\r\nThe timespec TLV encodes a \"timespec\"-compatible structure which represents the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch, represented as a combination of a whole number (seconds) and fractional part (nanoseconds). The whole number is represented as a little endian 64-bit integer and the fractional part is represented as a little endian 32-bit integer.\r\n\r\n[encoding additional TLVs]: https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/v2.7.0/doc/proxy-protocol.txt#L514-L534\r\n[reserved for application-specific data]: https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/v2.7.0/doc/proxy-protocol.txt#L677-L682", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/issues/46/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/issues/46/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/issues/45", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/issues/45/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/issues/45/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/issues/45/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fastly/dnstap-utils/pull/45", "id": 1575383642, "node_id": "PR_kwDOF9cY8M5JfKTS", "number": 45, "title": "dnstap-dump: `NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp()` \u2192 `NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp_opt()", "user": {"login": "edmondsfastly", "id": 73626355, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNjI2MzU1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73626355?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly", "html_url": "https://github.com/edmondsfastly", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edmondsfastly/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-02-08T03:07:53Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-08T03:15:54Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-08T03:15:50Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fastly/dnstap-utils/pulls/45", "html_url": "https://github.com/fastly/dnstap-utils/pull/45", "diff_url": "https://github.com/fastly/dnstap-utils/pull/45.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/fastly/dnstap-utils/pull/45.patch", "merged_at": "2023-02-08T03:15:50Z"}, "body": "[`NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp()`](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/naive/struct.NaiveDateTime.html#method.from_timestamp) has been deprecated in favor of [`NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp_opt()`](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/naive/struct.NaiveDateTime.html#method.from_timestamp_opt).
