While this hostcall exists on the fleet and had been updated\r\ninternally, we hadn't updated Viceroy to have access to it as well\r\nthrough a public update. This commit brings Viceroy in line with the\r\ncurrent Rust SDK release and stubs out the\r\n`auto_decompress_response_set` function for `Request` that can be\r\nimplemented for local testing in a commit. For now this will stop\r\nclients from crashing when testing locally.\r\n\r\nFixes #110\r\n\r\nIn order to test I ran the sample program locally from the linked issue.

The main downside is that there's a bit of boilerplate around TCP/TLS streams.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, this PR also refactors the CLI backend health checks to use the Viceroy library, rather than connecting in its own way, which will help ensure we keep those in sync.\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that this PR:\r\n\r\nFixes #91 \r\nFixes #96", "reactions": {"url":
