CONFIG\r\n\t- It was convenient to call everywhere as a global variable\r\n\t- It made it hard to set configuration after the launch process (from cli args)\r\n\t- There is a bit of a `CONFIG`/`config` mess due to wanting to not wanting to change the call sites too much for this PR.\r\n\t\r\n### Changes\r\n- `allowed_endpoints` reverted back to [*]\r\n\t- No need to force users to create a toml file to enable private UnifiedPush services\r\n- merged UserConfig into Config, the separation wasn't all that useful\r\n\t- UserConfig only held the data and the loading by env path toml\r\n\t- Config only wrapped the signal ws server and the crate version\r\n\t\t- crate version is only used as an endpoint in the web service, so it got moved there\r\n\t- Most of the functionality called the data from UserConfig anyways\r\n- replaced `print_cfg()` in `test` command with `config::print()`\r\n- moved all config methods out of `impl`, due to `lazy_static!` -> `OnceLock`\r\n\t\r\n### Questions\r\n- UX discussions needed for `allowed_endpoints`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mollyim/mollysocket/issues/13/reactions", "total_count": 1,
