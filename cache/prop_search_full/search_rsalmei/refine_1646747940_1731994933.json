After a complete overhaul of the code, it's time to release 1.0!\r\nIt's an accomplishment I'm proud of, which took over 70 commits and a month's work, resulting in almost all the code being rewritten. It is more mature, stable, and well-structured now.\r\n\r\nThe major motivation for this version is the rebuild Partial mode! We can now rebuild collections even when some paths are not available! This means that files not affected by the specified naming rules will stay the same, keeping their sequence numbers, while new files are appended after the highest sequence found. It is handy for collections on external drives or cloud storage which are not always connected, allowing you to, even on the go, rebuild new files without messing up previous ones.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/4/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/3", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/3/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/3/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/3/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsalmei/refine/pull/3", "id": 2443900727, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHZhxfM53MvZX", "number": 3, "title": "v0.16", "user": {"login": "rsalmei", "id": 6652853, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTI4NTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6652853?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsalmei", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsalmei/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 7279909946, "node_id": "LA_kwDOHZhxfM8AAAABseqcOg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/labels/size/XXL", "name": "size/XXL", "color": "E50009", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2024-08-02T03:05:04Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T03:07:22Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-02T03:07:18Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/pulls/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsalmei/refine/pull/3", "diff_url": "https://github.com/rsalmei/refine/pull/3.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/rsalmei/refine/pull/3.patch", "merged_at": "2024-08-02T03:07:18Z"}, "body": "### New in 0.16\r\n\r\n- complete overhaul of the scan system, allowing directories to be extracted alongside files\r\n- new `join` command, already with directory support\r\n- new magic `-i` and `-x` options that filter both files and directories\r\n- new filter options for files, directories and extensions\r\n- rename: include directory support\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/3/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rsalmei/refine/issues/3/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
