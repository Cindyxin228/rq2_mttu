However, `Signals` would return `Poll::Ready`, which would cause the Server to miss any other signal after that. This is probably better than just quitting on `SIGHUP`, because it's common to repurpose it for something other than quitting.\r\n\r\nThis is technically a breaking change, but it will only break the code from someone that was relying on using `SIGHUP` to stop the server from handling other future signals, which seems weird...\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR fixes or closes an issue, reference it here.

There is one potential footgun with `config` module. It's that it pack multiple service factory calls into one future. This result in any failure of service would trigger restart of all the packed services. This could be an issue when service factories have dependent on external state.\r\n\r\n2.  `actix-server` right now have a strict 1:1 mapping between socket and service. This lead to duplicated service types across worker threads and preventing service state share when multiple sockets can/should share one service. `config` module get in the way of resolving this issue as it has a unique set of API.\r\n\r\n3. Nothing use `config` module.\r\n\r\nThe removal would be tempoaray until socket/service mapping is figured out.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR fixes or closes an issue, reference it here. -->\r\n<!-- Closes #000 -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/349/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/349/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/346", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/346/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/346/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/346/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/346", "id": 862407433, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjE4OTg0NzA2", "number": 346, "title": "prepare codec 0.4.0 release", "user": {"login": "robjtede", "id": 3316789, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede", "html_url": "https://github.com/robjtede", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-04-20T04:48:31Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-21T10:08:44Z", "closed_at": "2021-04-21T10:08:44Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/pulls/346", "html_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/346", "diff_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/346.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/346.patch", "merged_at": "2021-04-21T10:08:44Z"}, "body": "## PR Type\r\n<!-- What kind of change does this PR make?

As previous service states are set to `WorkerServiceStatus::Failed` which would skip future readiness check and render they skip `poll_ready` check from then on.\r\n\r\nWhen multiple services are started with `ServerBuilder::configure` API the factory service future would return a vec of `(Token, BoxedServerService)` type. And the restart logic would always take the first element from the vec. Making there is no way to restart any service other than the first one registered to `configure`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these two bug with properly handle every error returned with `Service::poll_ready` and not skip to next untill the last one is resolved. After the service restart the `Token` of restarting service would be used to get the correct element in returned vector instead of only using the first one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR fixes or closes an issue, reference it here. -->\r\n<!-- Closes #000 -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/318/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/318/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/317", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/317/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/317/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/issues/317/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/317", "id": 849952501, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjA4NjA0NjY2", "number": 317, "title": "Use named type for WorkerState::Restarting and Shutdown", "user": {"login": "fakeshadow", "id": 7859909, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk5MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7859909?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow", "html_url": "https://github.com/fakeshadow", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fakeshadow/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-04-04T20:13:19Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-04T20:53:19Z", "closed_at": "2021-04-04T20:53:19Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-net/pulls/317", "html_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/317", "diff_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/317.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/317.patch", "merged_at": "2021-04-04T20:53:19Z"}, "body": "## PR Type\r\n<!-- What kind of change does this PR make? -->\r\n<!-- Bug Fix / Feature / Refactor / Code Style / Other -->\r\nRefactor\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nCheck your PR fulfills the following:\r\n\r\n<!-- For draft PRs check the boxes as you complete them. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Format code with the latest stable rustfmt\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n<!-- Describe the current and new behavior. -->\r\n<!-- Emphasize any breaking changes. -->\r\nUse named type for `WorkerState` enum variants.
