@clux\r\n\r\nThis is an extended version of #13, which fixes the concern related to the repeated definition of the \"Author\" struct as different JSON objects. The strategy I applied here is the same as is used for recursive definitions already: when a struct with the same name as an existing definition is encountered, the name is disambiguated by adding the container name as a prefix.\r\n\r\nThis works well for me and allows all events to exist in events.txt without breaking Push and Ping. However:\r\n 1. ~~It is overeager, because repeated structs are redefined under different names even if their definition is identical (i.e., we may end up with several copies of what is really the same struct).~~\r\n 2. It may break existing code, since the names of some nested structs have changed.\r\n\r\nIf neither of those is a concern, this fix should comprehensively address #13.", "reactions": {"url":
