A synchronous API is also exposed, which is implemented\r\nby simply waiting on the asynchronous API futures.\r\n\r\nThis also modifies the existing Tty logic so that the storage type of\r\nthe data is a Vec<u8> rather than a String. This is also how the Rust\r\nstandard library persists data from the standard streams. In my\r\nparticular application, I'm using stdin/stdout as the communication\r\nmethod between a container a host application. In it, a byte-based protocol is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nStreaming works by performing a TCP upgrade; upgrading a higher-level\r\nHTTP connection to a lower-level TCP byte stream upon agreement with the\r\nserver. Docker will automatically upgrade HTTP container log requests to\r\nTCP byte streams of a custom std{in,out,err} multiplexing protocol if\r\nthe client requests it with the 'Connection: Upgrade' header.\r\n\r\n## How did you verify your change:\r\n\r\nI've got a project that implements a nontrivial byte-based protocol to send command/reply frames from the host app to the container over stdout/stdin. I can successfully parse, send, and process frames in both directions asynchronously with this patch.\r\n\r\n## What (if anything) would need to be called out in the CHANGELOG for the next release:\r\n\r\n  * The `Container::logs` function now returns a `tty::Chunk` type containing raw bytes, rather than a `TtyLine` object containing a UTF-8 string.\r\n  * The standard streams of
