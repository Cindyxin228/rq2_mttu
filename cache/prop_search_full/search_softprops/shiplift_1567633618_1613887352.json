In particular, `{Containers, Images, Networks, Services, Volumes}::get()` now return a `{Container, Image, Network, Service, Volume}` which is tied to the lifetime of the `Docker` they container rather than the lifetime of the `{Containers, ...}` which created them. This means we no longer have to create unnecessary locals such as `images` in the following code to avoid the compiler complaining about `temporary value dropped while borrowed`\r\n```rust\r\nlet images = docker.images();\r\nlet mut stream = images.build(&options);\r\n```\r\nInstead, we can write the following as you would intuitively expect to work.\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut stream = docker.images().build(&options);\r\n```\r\n\r\nVarious other methods were also fixed. Generally, anything that returned a stream is now exclusively tied to the lifetime of the `Docker` used to create them (or `Transport` for `transport.rs`) rather than the lifetime of both the `Docker` and whatever they use as input (e.g. `ExecOptions` for `Container::exec()`).\r\n\r\nFurther, I renamed lifetimes from `'a` to `'docker` and made some lifetimes explicit to make the code easier to read and understand.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this closes an open issue please replace xxx below with the issue number\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCloses: #271 \r\n\r\n## How did you verify your change:\r\n\r\nRan unit tests.\r\n\r\n## What (if anything) would need to be called out in the CHANGELOG for the next release:\r\n\r\nThis should be backwards compatible because in every case I made the lifetimes less restrictive.

Please apply formatting with `cargo +nightly fmt --all` before submitting a pr.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What did you implement:\r\n\r\nI added options to set the `StopSignal` and `StopTimeout` options in [`/container/create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40/#operation/ContainerCreate).\r\n\r\nSince StopSignal can be either a string or a number, I added methods for both. I thought about using [`nix::sys::signal::Signal`](https://docs.rs/nix/0.19.1/nix/sys/signal/enum.Signal.html) but it seemed unnecessary to bring in the entire library for a single enum.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this closes an open issue please replace xxx below with the issue number\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you verify your change:\r\n\r\nI tested this manually on my codie-discord project which uses shiplift.\r\n\r\n## What (if anything) would need to be called out in the CHANGELOG for the next release:\r\n\r\nThe changelog was updated in this PR.\r\n\r\n* add StopSignal and
