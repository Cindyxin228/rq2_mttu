test that case).\r\n\r\n#### How did you verify your change:\r\n\r\nI compiled https://github.com/dbaron/wgmeeting-github-ircbot/ with a modified version of hubcaps (although applying this patch to the 0.5 release, since I didn't want to figure out the changes needed to upgrade my code to hubcaps master), and ran the test version to successfully remove the label in dbaron/wgmeeting-github-ircbot#40, which had previously failed with the failure described in https://github.com/dbaron/wgmeeting-github-ircbot/issues/40#issuecomment-577728948.\r\n\r\n#### What (if
