executable that is tested.\r\n\r\nThere's a bit of code already there for specifying arguments for the executable.\r\n\r\nMy idea currently is to call the executable with commands to tell it how it should behave, for example \"subscribe to topic A\", \"send message on topic A\", \"subscribe to topic B\", ... etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a rough sketchup for now, but I'd like to get some feedback on it. The idea is to let the tests later specify how the executable should behave for the test but there might be also an opportunity somewhere that the tests are feeded with commands and they test their individual thing for a given procedure the executable follows...\r\n\r\n@TheNeikos what do you think?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheNeikos/cloudmqtt/issues/117/reactions",
