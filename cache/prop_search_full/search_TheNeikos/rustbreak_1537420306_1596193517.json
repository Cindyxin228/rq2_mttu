tests (mainly to `lib.rs`) and some integration tests (`tests/integration_test.rs`).\r\nChanges to the code:\r\n- Fix the save order in `Database::put_data` with `save=true`. (During rebase I saw you fixed it independently in #78.) Also factors out the code shared between`Database::put_data` and `Database::save` (as was stated in a TODO comment) to a privat method `Database::save_data_locked`.\r\n- Only read lock `Database.data` in functions which didn't require a write lock but did acquire one.\r\n- Reduce potential for deadlocks as reported by TSAN (on the added tests), by never acquiring multiple locks at the same time. I don't think those deadlocks could actually be created through the API since all methods seem to always acquire the required lock on `Database.data` before the one on `Database.backend`, but I don't see any reason in the current implementation to not release the first lock before acquiring the second.\r\n  Also the common code between `Database::load` and `Database::get_data` with `load=true` has been factored out (even further) into `Database::load_get_data_lock`, and `Database::inner_load` is commented out (no longer used).\r\n\r\nThere were quite some merge conflicts during rebase, so I hope I didn't break anything while fixing them.
