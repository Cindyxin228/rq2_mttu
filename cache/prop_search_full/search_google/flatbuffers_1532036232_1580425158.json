evolution of enums.\r\nNumerical result of conversion `binary->json->binary` might depend on flag `output_enum_identifiers` and enum value.\r\nThe first commit adds a simple test case.\r\nLet's imagine we receive a binary message with `color=(1u << 2) | Color_Blue | Color_Red)`.\r\nIf `output_enum_identifiers=false`, json output will be correct: `color: 13`.\r\nBut for `case output_enum_identifiers=true` it will be: `color: \"Red Blue\"`.\r\nIf convert this wrong JSON back into a binary message, the `(1u << 2)` flag will be lost.\r\nThis PR fixes it (function `PrintScalar`).\r\n\r\nOther changes are refactoring to improve readability and performance.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/flatbuffers/issues/5706/reactions",

to have access to the flatbuffer schemas in the shipped product I'm building. I find it hard to manage the schemas used in different libraries even with the bfbs format. I have many libraries (50+) built on various platforms (C++) and each have there own set of unique schemas. This make packaging the schemas after the build complicated. With the cross platform support, access to the schemas make it even more complicated.\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to ensure the schema used to produce the generated code can also be stored in the source code and not rely on external files, zip, etc for the schema definition. The idea is to take the binary schema data and encode it into the generated source. That way the schema definition can optionally be part of the binaries (dll/exe/etc). This solves some of the cross platform packaging issues and also ensures the schemas will not be lost.\r\n\r\nUsing the following will generate code for the schema:\r\nflatc.exe --cpp --bfbs-gen-embed monster.fbs\r\n\r\nThe binary schema can be accessed using the generated header file monster_bfbs_generated.h and the struct <root_type>BinarySchema.\r\n\r\nSee the example in sample/sample_bfbs.cpp  \r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include \"monster_bfbs_generated.h\" \r\n\r\n// Initialize parser by deserializing bfbs schema from source.\r\nflatbuffers::Parser

For each table, generate a `Traits` nested class that provides compile-time information about the Flatbuffers table type in an extensible way.  This will make Flatbuffers generated C++ code more friendly to code bases that make use of C++ template meta-programming techniques to manage the serialization process.  Initially, we populate the `Traits` class simply with the associated factory function for the table.  Example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n       // The name of the Flatbuffers type (and namespace) must\r\n       // be hard-coded when writing the factory function.\r\n       auto monster = cpp17::MyGame::Example::CreateMonster(fbb, ...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n       using TypeToCreate = cpp17::MyGame::Example::Monster;\r\n       auto monster = TypeToCreate::Traits::Create(fbb, ...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature, as currently implemented, requires building with C++17 or greater, and thus it is guarded behind `--cpp-std` >= `c++17` in the flatbuffers C++ generator.  `generate_code.sh` results are included as well as a new unit test case exercising this new feature.\r\n\r\n2.

"merged_at": "2020-01-09T20:12:10Z"}, "body": "Good afternoon, \r\n\r\n@mzaks and I hope with this PR we would be able to add an official implementation for swift, it's heavily inspired by the `C++` and `C#` implementations. There are some elements that are still missing such as the code generator and also documentation for the code base, however I found that we can implement those after getting an initial review for the swift code base, and if it lives up to the standards. \r\n\r\nThe `FlatBuffer` class  uses apples underlaying `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` which allows is to write directly to the memory, and lefts a lot of heavy weight from our shoulders, since this implementation comes which the following function `storeBytes` with takes a value and it's Bytes representation and just adds it to the buffer. `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` the name is a bit misleading since it's actually safe to use if everything writing the bytes is well structured. and since we don't really allow the user to get to the underlying adding and pushing to the buffer and only allowing them to do so through the `builder` it would be completely safe to use it.\r\n\r\nThe `FlatBuffersBuilder` class uses the same underlying logic as `C++` and `C#`, but unlike `C#` it relies on generics to actually add bytes and elements into the buffer. we took a different approach regarding adding the structs into the buffer, since swift uses the `storeBytes` to actually store the struct into the buffer, and since `FlatBuffers` do not allow string in `Structs` we took that into our advantage. \r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct Vec2: Writeable {\r\n    var _x: Float32\r\n    var _y: Float32\r\n    var _z: Float32\r\n    var _c: Color2\r\n\r\n     init(x: Float32, y: Float32, z: Float32, color: Color2) { _c = color; _x = x; _y = y; _z = z }\r\n\r\n     static func createVec2(_ bb: FlatBuffersBuilder, v: Vec2) -> Offset<UOffset> {\r\n        return bb.create(struct: v)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe following struct will be able to be directly inserted into the buffer, and we will be implementing a reader struct that will read the Writable struct as shown below. This will have the same concept as the builder Objects in c++. The readers were implemented to follow the `C#` way of fetching elements from the buffer.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct Vec2_Read: Readable {\r\n    private var __p: Struct\r\n    init(_ fb: FlatBuffer, o: Int32) { __p = Struct(bb: fb, position: o) }\r\n    var c: Color2 { return Color2(rawValue: __p.readBuffer(of: Int32.self, at: 12)) ?? .red }\r\n    var x: Float32 { return __p.readBuffer(of: Float32.self, at: 0)}\r\n    var y: Float32 { return __p.readBuffer(of: Float32.self, at: 4)}\r\n    var z: Float32 { return __p.readBuffer(of: Float32.self, at: 8)}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the test case are passing, and they were created by the `flatc` code generator for both `C++` and `C#`, and the basic implementation of swift was verified against those two since the code generator isn't implemented yet. \r\n\r\nwhat's missing:\r\n1- Code Generator\r\n2- Documentation\r\n3- Benchmarking\r\n\r\nwhen merging this PR we would be closing the following issues, Closes #5504. and I will be rebasing the commit before merging for sure\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/flatbuffers/issues/5603/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

flatbuffer without incurring an additional memcopy to an intermediary `byte[]`.  This change adds two new static methods to the Java `FlatBufferBuilder` to improve this. \r\n\r\nFirst is a method that takes a `byte[]` with an `offset` and `length`, so that large `byte[]` doesn't have to be copied to an intermediary before being copied into the `FlatBufferBuilder` internal buffer. Secondly, a method that takes `ByteBuffer` is provided, as internally the `FlatBufferBuilder` using a `ByteBuffer` for storage. This method then can rely on the efficiency of the `ByteBuffer.put(ByteBuffer other)` copy. This should handle 'direct' and native `ByteBuffer`s as well as buffers with different limits and position markers.\r\n\r\nThis change also updates the Java generation code for `byte[]` fields to internally use those new static methods described above.  Previously the code generation generated for-loop and added each element one at a time; this comes with increased overhead costs of the extra method invocations. \r\n\r\nAdded Tests to the JavaTest.java file that test different type of copies.\r\n\r\n**Performance gains:**\r\n\r\nCopied 1 MB `byte[]` 1,000 times.\r\n\r\nOriginal implementation: avg = 2.4 ms / copy\r\nNew implementation: avg = 0.1 ms / copy\r\n\r\nWhich is roughly a **~25x** speed up.
