It can replace\n>   the bunch of free functions: `image::{load_*, open, image_dimensions}` while\n>   enabling new combinations such as `open` but with format deduced from content\n>   instead of file path.\n> - Fixed `const_err` lint in the macro expanded implementations of `Pixel`. This\n>   can only affect your crate if `image` is used as a path dependency.\n> \n> ### Version 0.22.2\n> \n> - Undeprecate `unsafe` trait accessors. Further evaluation showed that their\n>   deprecation should be delayed until trait `impl` specialization is available.\n> - Fixed magic bytes used to detect `tiff` images.\n> - Added `DynamicImage::from_decoder`.\n> - Fixed a bug in the `PNGReader` that caused an infinite loop.\n> - Added `ColorType::{bits_per_pixel, num_components}`.\n> - Added `ImageFormat::from_path`, same format deduction as the `open` method.\n> - Fixed a panic in the gif decoder.\n> - Aligned background color handling of `gif` to web browser implementations.\n> - Fixed handling of partial frames in animated `gif`.\n> - Removed unused direct `lzw` dependency, an indirect dependency in `tiff`.\n> \n> ### Version 0.22.1\n> \n> - Fixed build without no features enabled\n> \n> ### Version 0.22\n> \n> - The required Rust version is now `1.34.2`.\n> - Note the website and blog: [image-rs.org][1] and [blog.image-rs.org][2]\n> - `PixelMut` now only on `ImageBuffer` and removed from `GenericImage`\n>   interface. Prefer iterating manually in the generic case.\n> - Replaced an unsafe interface in the hdr decoder with a safe variant.\n> - Support loading 2-bit BMP images\n> - Add method to save an `ImageBuffer`/`DynamicImage` with specified format\n> - Update tiff to `0.3` with a writer\n> - Update png to `0.15`, fixes reading of interlaced sub-byte pixels\n> - Always use custom struct for `ImageDecoder::Reader`\n> - Added `apply_without_alpha` and `map_without_alpha` to `Pixel` trait\n> - Pixel information now with associated constants instead of static methods\n> - Changed color structs to tuple types with single component. Improves\n>   ergonomics of destructuring assignment and construction.\n> - Add lifetime parameter on `ImageDecoder` trait.\n> - Remove unecessary `'static` bounds on affine operations\n> - Add function to retrieve image dimensions without loading full image\n> - Allow different image types in overlay and replace\n> - Iterators over rows of `ImageBuffer`, mutable variants\n> \n> [1]: https://www.image-rs.org\n></tr></table> ...
