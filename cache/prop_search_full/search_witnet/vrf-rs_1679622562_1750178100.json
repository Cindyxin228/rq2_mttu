Rework error handling. Make error handling messages substituted by derived macro on `Error` enum, with macro provided by `thiserror` crate. Update and bump up project dependencies.**\r\n\r\nHey guys!\r\n\r\n`Failure` crate is vulnerable in terms of `Fail` type non-local implementation and marco expansion.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/andrcmdr/secure-enclaves-framework/security/dependabot/37\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/andrcmdr/secure-enclaves-framework/security/dependabot/36\r\n\r\nI've recently made a fix for that vulnerability by completely removing `failure` crate and replacing it with `thiserror`. Problem caused by non-local impl of `Fail` type and `Fail` macro expansion in already unsupported `failure` crate. Strange error handling solution overall. Better not to introduce such dependencies and use standalone error handling approach from Rust stdlib.\r\nAlso changed an `Error` type in dummy.rs implementation to that errors and its messages from `openssl` submodule, that's more correct.\r\nAlso updated some outdated dependencies (as OpenSSL, which also was vulnerable several times recently).\r\n\r\nThus opened up this PR as interested in this library further development, other additional cipher suites implementation and library support overall.\r\n\r\nFeel free to take it and pull from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/andrcmdr/vrf-rs/commit/3304a65e5abae98618db70c729d21d36f4dbc7fd\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/andrcmdr/vrf-rs\r\n\r\nWonderful library, following RFCs, appreciate your work!
