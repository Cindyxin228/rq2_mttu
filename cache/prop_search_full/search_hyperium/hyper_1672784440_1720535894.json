"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3691.patch", "merged_at": "2024-07-01T13:19:43Z"}, "body": "This change adds a `try_send_request()` method to `SendRequest`. This method returns a `TrySendError` type, which allows for returning the request back to the caller if an error occured between queuing and trying to write the request.\r\n\r\nThis method is added for both `http1` and `http2`.\r\n\r\nCloses #3673 \r\nCloses https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2325\r\n\r\n(Well, after hyper-util makes use of it.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nIf you try to `send_request(req)` at the same time the server is closing the connection, it's possible hyper will notice the HUP before the request gets serialized. If so, theoretically the request is safe to try on another connection.\r\n\r\nBut there isn't a mechanism for hyper to give the request _back_. And since the pool was moved out of hyper, it doesn't know how to just grab another connection.\r\n\r\n**Need**: a mechanism to return the request on specific kinds of errors.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n- Something like `try_send_request(req)`, which returns a `TrySendError`.\r\n- Embed the request into the `hyper::Error`.\r\n- Put some channel-like thing in `req.extensions()`.\r\n\r\n### TrySendError\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut req = Request::new(body);\r\nloop {\r\n    match tx.try_send_request(req).await {\r\n        Ok(_) => yay,\r\n        Err(TrySendError::Queued { error, request }) => {\r\n            req = req_back;\r\n            continue;\r\n        },\r\n        Err(TrySendError::Sent { error }) => {\r\n            return Err(e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- From a Rust perspective, it's simple. There's [`std::sync::mpsc::TrySendError`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/enum.TrySendError.html) as prior art.\r\n- Cheap, no allocations needed, even on the happy path.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- Would be needed for each `http1::SendRequest` and `http2::SendRequest`.\r\n- Intangibly, it feels \"clumsy\". Why wouldn't `send_request()` have handled this?\r\n    - If after trying this out and finding it should be the way, we could create `fn send()` and hide `try_send_request()` and `send_request()`.\r\n- Structural matching and enums must be designed with future-compatility changes.\r\n    - We don't have to expose an enum. It can just have methods.\r\n\r\n### Embed in `hyper::Error`\r\n\r\nAfter writing all this out, this is probably not possible.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Feels more elegant.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- How do you access the request after?\r\n    - Adding `Error::request()` set of APIs seems to pollute the type.\r\n        - Perhaps an `ext` API can access it...\r\n            - But that would require allocation even on success.\r\n- What if you keep the `Error` around but didn't expect the `Request<B>` to live with it?\r\n    - Is this really a problem? Unknown... But if it is...\r\n    - Could an `ext` be set to signal to hyper that it's OK? Then it becomes opt-in.\r\n- Cannot embed `Request<B>` if the body is `!Send`\r\n    - Can we even do this generically at all?\r\n    - Maybe if the `ext` passed converts into an `Any`...\r\n\r\n### Pass `ext::CaptureTrySend`?\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut req = Request::new(body);\r\nloop {\r\n    // inserts a capture channel extension, returns the receiver\r\n    let try_rx = hyper::ext::capture_try_send(&mut req);\r\n\r\n    match tx.send_request(req).await {\r\n        Ok(_) => yay,\r\n        Err(e) => {\r\n            // take it back\r\n            if let Some(req_back) = try_rx.req().await {\r\n                // try again...\r\n                req = req_back;\r\n                continue;\r\n            } else {\r\n                return Err(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Works with any `B`\r\n- Doesn't keep request stuck in the `Error` for longer than expected\r\n\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- Requires allocating `req.extensions()` for basically every request...\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3691/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0,

According to RFC 9110 \"HTTP Semantics\", the `Trailer` header is not listed as a \"hop-by-hop\" header in section 7.6.1. [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html) specifies that a sender intending to generate one or more trailer fields in a message should use the `Trailer` header in the header section to indicate potential trailer fields, as mentioned in section 6.6.2.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation in hyper may result in unnecessary warnings for gRPC calls, as gRPC implementations, such as grpc-go, routinely use the `Trailer` header to indicate the presence of trailers after the response body. (See this behavior in [grpc-go's implementation](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/d32e66ce27447a0a217464a36fdd3935801c0453/internal/transport/handler_server.go#L306).\r\n\r\nThis fix updates hyper to correctly allow the `Trailer` header in HTTP/2 responses, aligning it with RFC 9110 and preventing misleading warnings in environments using gRPC, such as linkerd2-proxy, which prints a warning `Connection header illegal in HTTP/2: trailer` on every gRPC call.\r\n\r\nNote: [Mozilla's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection) mistakenly lists `Trailer` as a hop-by-hop header, which is incorrect.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3648/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3648/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3644", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3644/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3644/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3644/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3644", "id": 2257649895, "node_id": "PR_kwDOAWaYQc5taSCM", "number": 3644, "title": "Customization of whether server date headers are sent", "user": {"login": "edwardwc", "id": 76141700, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTQxNzAw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76141700?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc", "html_url": "https://github.com/edwardwc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/edwardwc/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-04-22T23:53:14Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-29T18:12:22Z", "closed_at": "2024-04-29T18:12:22Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/pulls/3644", "html_url": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3644", "diff_url": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3644.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3644.patch", "merged_at": "2024-04-29T18:12:22Z"}, "body": "Initially starting with issue #912 then followed up with pull request #2751, this pull request addresses the need for customizing whether the server sends the `date` header for http/2 and http/1.1.\r\n\r\nAccording to RFC7231#7.1.1.2, it is not always preferable to send the `date` header if the system may not have access to time or may not be accurate.

using the Hyper FFI interface is correct, because it is under-documented. I've tried to document things better based on my reading of the Rust code, client.c, and my knowledge of the Rust async ecosystem. @seanmonstar please take a look and let me know if I've gotten anything wrong. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThe general themes are:\r\n\r\n - I gave each struct a detailed description, including how to get one.\r\n - I added a list of methods for each struct. I know users can find the methods by searching for the struct name, but having them all in one place makes it much easier to quickly understand the operations on a struct.\r\n - I made task-creation functions consistently say \"Creates a task that X\" instead of \"does X\", to make it clearer that nothing happens right away.\r\n - I tried to cross-reference functions, to make it easy to figure out \"how to get one\" and \"what to do next.\"\r\n - I specifically documented the relationship between a `hyper_clientconn` and a `hyper_io`, and why that means that a `hyper_clientconn` goes with a TCP/TLS connection for its lifetime.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3424/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,
