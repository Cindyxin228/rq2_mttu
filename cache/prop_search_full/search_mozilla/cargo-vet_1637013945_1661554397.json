(initial shifts to \"exemptions\" happens here and is smeared through the commits, but most changes are in the last commit)\r\n\r\n* second commit: `regenerate audit-as-crates-io` impl, just runs check_audit_as_crates_io and sets all erroring policies to `Some(false)`. This is now implicitly performed by `init` so that `check` will be guaranteed to pass again.\r\n\r\n* third commit: `regenerate imports` impl. This is identical to `fetch imports` except it sets an `accept_changes` flag to true. The bulk of the change here is to execute `eula_for_criteria` while fetching the imports to cache the value in `description` if it has a `description_url` and to check if it differs from the previously cached value (if it exists). The `accept_changes` flag determines if a mismatch is an error.\r\n\r\n* fourth commit: \"exemptions\" rename. I avoided renaming some of the test files to minimize the diff on the tests. We can finish that in a second pass.\r\n\r\nThe second and third commit both merit me writing some tests for that functionality. The second is kinda trivial, while the third would require me setting up a new kind of test that can mock the fetch..?\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/237/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/237/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/235", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/235/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/235/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/235/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/235", "id": 1287932553, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHAJrh846hsdY", "number": 235, "title": "Allow specifying global options after subcommands", "user": {"login": "mystor", "id": 1261662, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE2NjI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1261662?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor", "html_url": "https://github.com/mystor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-06-28T21:42:00Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-28T22:09:31Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-28T22:09:31Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/pulls/235", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/235", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/235.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/235.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-28T22:09:30Z"}, "body": "This patch makes a number of changes to subcommand parsing and help formatting to allow global options to be specified on subcommands as well as on the toplevel command.

This is to avoid potential mistakes, as it would be easy to miss the fact that the wrong version\r\nwas selected.\r\n\r\nSecond, when suggesting criteria to certify, the command will try harder to find the relevant set of criteria. If the diff or version\r\nbeing certified isn't found in the `suggest` output history, it will now also check the unaudited table, and fall back to running the resolver to determine what criteria would heal the graph when specified for this revision.\r\n\r\nThis pass with the resolver is intended to be more relaxed that `suggest`, as the precise delta being checked is already known, so it\r\nshould be able to give suggested criteria even for audits which would not be suggested by the `suggest` algorithm.\r\n\r\nFixes #192 ", "reactions": {"url":

Each of the changes are described below:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Use the 'dirs' crate to store our cache in a platform-appropriate cache directory</summary>\r\n\r\nThis is a more persistent place to write the cache than in the temporary\r\ndirectory, and we'll implement a GC mechanism on top of it to clean out\r\nunnecessary cache files over time in a later commit.\r\n\r\nThis also renames some variables to reflect that the directory is now\r\nexplicitly a cache, rather a temporary directory.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>More aggressively make parallelizable io async</summary>\r\n\r\nThis makes all io around networking and diffing crates async, and attempts to\r\nrun things concurrently as much as possible. For example, when generating\r\ndiffstats for suggest, all crate downloads and their diffs are run concurrently\r\nwith limits to avoid too many connections to crates.io at once.\r\n\r\nThis refactor also includes some extra logic which was added to the package\r\nfetching logic to ensure that we update the mtime on the .crate file whenever\r\nit is accessed, so that information can be used in the next patch for GC.\r\n\r\nTo make this change, the cache needed to be made shareable across multiple\r\nconcurrent tasks. The core mutable state was moved behind a mutex, and new\r\ntables of async OnceCells were added to ensure that only one task would attempt\r\nto download or diffstat each crate at a time.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the time to perform a `cargo vet suggest` on\r\nmozilla-central with an empty cache and use of the cargo registry cache\r\ndisabled, reduced from ~18s to ~1.5s.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Add a 'vet gc' command to remove old packages from the cache</summary>\r\n\r\nThis command will delete any unrecognized files in the cache directory, as well\r\nas old/out-of-date packages. In addition, a `--clean` flag was added which is\r\neven more aggressive, removing even the diffcache and command-history.json.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nFixes #191\r\nFixes #132 ", "reactions": {"url":

"2022-06-14T22:38:37Z"}, "body": "This rejigs a crapton of code to make all networking completely explicit and async.\r\n\r\nTo make this more tolerable, some things that randomly do networking (notably compute_suggest) have been hoisted out of methods and must now have their result passed in, keeping those parts of the code \"network pure\".\r\n\r\nTo keep the rest of the code logically sync/main-threaded, we now spin-up a tokio runtime whenever we have a burst of \"need to do some async work\". One of the nastier consequences of this is that anything that wants to be async needs to be rooted in all `'static` inputs even though we subsequently block on them, so i had to rejig some stuff to take e.g. String instead of &str or be a free function instead of a method. Some of this could be cleaned up by requiring `Arc` instead of `&`, but I'm still feeling out the design space.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by #90, #132, and #167.\r\n\r\nFor #132, this is only a partial answer as it only parallelizes networking in places where queries are non-conflicting \"by construction\" and does not allow for greater parallelism in suggest by kicking off every package's suggest in parallel. In particular a \"first suggest\" will still be very slow because none of the git-diffing or even cache-sniffing is parallel, only the downloading.\r\n\r\nFor #167, it now makes all code \"trivially\" --frozen correct, as the only way to get network access is to call something that checks that flag.\r\n\r\nFor #90, it was just going to be another situation where I need to do a bunch of network-poking and so I wanted to have a better story for when/where networking can happen. To complete it (which is what this PR will do when it's complete) I will need to further factor the code to pull DepGraph construction out of `resolve` and instead make the DepGraph an *input* to resolve. This is because computing is_third_party will become a value that depends on the Network to check if a non-crates.io dep *does* exist on crates.io.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/173/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/173/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/172", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/172/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/172/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/172/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/172", "id": 1268026624, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHAJrh845fgBP", "number": 172, "title": "Switch to toml_edit to get more control over serialization", "user": {"login": "mystor", "id": 1261662, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE2NjI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1261662?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor", "html_url": "https://github.com/mystor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mystor/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-06-10T21:06:48Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-13T16:45:07Z", "closed_at": "2022-06-13T16:45:07Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/pulls/172", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/172", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/172.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/172.patch", "merged_at": "2022-06-13T16:45:06Z"}, "body": "This allows us to perform custom formatting behaviours in a visitor over the serialized `toml_edit::Document`.

resolver in two major ways:\r\n\r\n* We use the cargo-metadata structures to compute our own structures and then stop looking at them, preferring interned package ids over raw strings\r\n* We attempt to more correctly handle the build-and-dev distinctions by doing two-phase analysis in several places\r\n  * When computing our topological sort, we first ignore dev-deps to get the \"normal\" build graph and compute roots, then we augment the graph by visiting dev-deps\r\n  * When resolving we now have a second pass `resolve_dev` step that is essentially the same as `resolve_first_party` but which only looks at dev-deps and does not record any successes. This essentially emulates a virtual root \"dev\" node on top of the real node.\r\n\r\n(I also did some drive-by requested output cleanups and had to insert some more manual sorting that was only incidentally happening because packageids are already name+version.)\r\n\r\nCurrent quirks that fall out of this implementation:\r\n\r\n* At no point do we ever distinguish build-deps from normal-deps. In implementation I realized the semantics of build-policies are weird to try to implement via \"bubble ups\". Also I have potentially convinced myself that we might be able to get away with eliminating the normal-build distinction by claiming the following adjustment to safe-to-deploy: for crates which exist to generate code like proc-macros and cc, \"safe-to-deploy\" refers to the *generated* code, and not the implementation itself. This is usually pretty clear because there aren't many crates that are incidentally used for builds that aren't *explicitly* for that purpose! This is certainly true for all proc-macros!\r\n\r\n* dev-deps are only every analyzed in the context of a virtual root node. As such, it is \"impossible\" to inherit policies from a parent and so we only ever use a build-and-dev policy directly on the node or the default root build-and-dev policy. I think this actually makes sense: **the quality of a particular package's tests has literally no impact on its parents**, and I don't really see a reason why the tests for a particular subtree would have higher or lower standards?

file\r\n  * Check looks for a .cargo-ok file which is written only after a complete successful fetch+decompress\r\n* Downloading the crate vaguely mimicks Cargo but with less sanity checks\r\n  * GET the url\r\n  * assume it's a tar.gz file and unpack to our cache\r\n  * write the .cargo-ok file\r\n* The diff_cache is now only loaded and written once per execution, instead of repeatedly\r\n\r\nSince we no longer run 'cargo' during fetch/diffing, everything seems significantly more responsive. Also now *everything* feeds into this common machinery so there's less random garbage in each command since most of the details are handled by the Cache.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't handle #29.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/60/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/60/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/53", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/53/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/53/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/53/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/53", "id": 1221501678, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHAJrh843GWvk", "number": 53, "title": "make more things optional", "user": {"login": "Gankra", "id": 1136864, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY4NjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136864?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra", "html_url": "https://github.com/Gankra", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-04-29T20:36:32Z", "updated_at": "2022-04-29T22:10:05Z", "closed_at": "2022-04-29T22:10:05Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/pulls/53", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/53", "diff_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/53.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/pull/53.patch", "merged_at": "2022-04-29T22:10:05Z"}, "body": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/53/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/53/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
