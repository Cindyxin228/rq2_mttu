highlights:\r\n(NB: TODOs blocked by release on docs.rs)\r\n\r\n### Ergonomics improvements\r\nA new `runtime::WatchSteamExt` (#899 + #906) allows for simpler setups for streams from `watcher` or `reflector`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- let stream = utils::try_flatten_applied(StreamBackoff::new(watcher(api, lp), b));\r\n+ let stream = watcher(api, lp).backoff(b).applied_objects();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `util::try_flatten_*` helpers have been marked as deprecated since they are not used in the new pipeline.\r\n\r\nA new `reflector:store()` fn allows simpler reflector setups #907:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- let store = reflector::store::Writer::<Node>::default();\r\n- let reader = store.as_reader();\r\n+ let (reader, writer) = reflector::store();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional conveniences getters/settes to `ResourceExt` for manged_fields and creation_timestamp #888 + #898, plus a `GroupVersion::with_kind` path to a GVK, and a `TryFrom<TypeMeta> for GroupVersionKind` in #896.\r\n\r\n### CRD Version Selection\r\nManaging multiple [version in CustomResourceDefinitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/) can be pretty complicated, but we now have helpers and docs on how to tackle it.\r\n\r\nA new function `kube::core::crd::merge_crds` (TODO: docs.rs link) have been added (in #889) to help push crd schemas generated by kube-derived crds with different `#[kube(version)]` properties. TODO: link to kube-derive segment.\r\n\r\nA new example showcases [how one can manage two or more versions of a crd](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/blob/7715cabd4d1976493e6b8949471f283df927a79e/examples/crd_derive_multi.rs#L12-L31) and what the expected truncation outcomes are when moving between versions. \r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nExamples now have moved to `tracing` for its logging, respects `RUST_LOG`, and namespace selection via the kubeconfig context. There is also a [larger kubectl example](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/blob/master/examples/kubectl.rs) showcasing `kubectl apply -f yaml` https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/blob/7715cabd4d1976493e6b8949471f283df927a79e/examples/kubectl.rs#L149-L170 as well as `kubectl {edit,delete,get,watch}` via #885 + #897.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

use of a watcher stream\r\n- [x] Example usage updated ([pod_reflector reduces internal memory use by modifying out

extension written into `Writer` to take a mutator (defaults to the identity)\r\n\r\nThe first part is the most substantial, and it required tweaking the Default + Debug implementations (which were done via Derivative before). There might be some ways to get around this with less trait restrictions on `F` but it always complained without this, and it seems to work well in a real word setting in example with a straight closure.\r\n\r\nThe use case for the mutator is memory improvements. Currently you can customize structs with [partially typed resources](https://kube.rs/controllers/object/#partially-typed-resource), but you cannot drop the significant contributions from `ObjectMeta` via its managed fields. Additionally, it feels a bit wrong to me to recommend rewriting structs when what we really want is just to drop what parts of it we store, and that can be done with a mutator. By the time we use it we have already extracted the key parts for the keys in the state so it should be pretty user-safe as well.\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

feature doesn't make sense for us because all targets still depend on `openssl` anyway. This is because `native-tls` requires PKCS#12 to create `Identity` for authentication with client certificates, and `openssl` is the only trusted option to generate them.\r\nA feature to create `Identity` from PKCS#8 was added a few days ago, but `openssl` is still necessary because we need to support more private key formats.\r\n\r\n`native-tls` feature is currently broken on macOS because Security Framework cannot import PKCS#12 generated by OpenSSL v3 (#691). I'm sure more users will run into this, especially the new ones, so it's not a good default.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nMake OpenSSL the default because we can't make Rustls due to #153. I don't think there are any downsides?\r\n\r\nWe can also remove `native-tls` feature. `openssl` will continue to be required because I don't think the different key formats we need will be supported

We currently allow users to supply a fully custom tower stack (with `Client::new`), but this requires users to rewrite the full middleware stack, including a bunch of kube-isms like injecting the base URI and adding authn headers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nExplain the context and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve?\r\nIf a new feature is being added, describe the intended use case that feature fulfills.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a new `ClientBuilder` API that allows the user to customize the stack before boxing it into a `Client`. Currently it only has a low-level API for wrapping the stack in another `Layer`, with the intention to add more user-friendly helpers later on as the need arises.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSummarize the solution and provide any necessary context needed to understand the code change.\r\n-->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/855/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/855/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/854", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/854/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/854/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/854/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/854", "id": 1176102921, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCV2pXc40xwm7", "number": 854, "title": "portforward: Improve API and support background task cancelation", "user": {"login": "olix0r", "id": 240738, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDczOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240738?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r", "html_url": "https://github.com/olix0r", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3647066676, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCV2pXc7ZYdI0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/labels/changelog-change", "name": "changelog-change", "color": "292C21", "default": false, "description": "changelog change category for prs"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/milestones/10", "html_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/milestone/10", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/milestones/10/labels", "id": 7792063, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCV2pXc4AduW_", "number": 10, "title": "0.71.0", "description": "", "creator": {"login": "clux", "id": 134092, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDA5Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134092?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux", "html_url": "https://github.com/clux", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 14, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2022-03-22T14:44:08Z", "updated_at": "2022-04-12T21:15:44Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2022-04-12T21:15:44Z"}, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2022-03-22T00:10:27Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-22T20:10:48Z", "closed_at": "2022-03-22T17:53:07Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/pulls/854", "html_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/854", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/854.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/854.patch", "merged_at": "2022-03-22T17:53:06Z"}, "body": "The portforward utility spawns a background task and returns a future\r\nthat completes when the background task completes, but the spawned\r\ntask's `JoinHandle` is discarded, so there's no way to cancel the\r\nbackground tasks before all of the port forwards complete.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the `Portforwarder` type to hold the `JoinHandle`\r\nand exposes a `Portforward::abort` method that cancels the spawned task.\r\n`impl Future for Portforward` changes to await the background task's\r\ncompletion.

This dependency is almost always pulled-in via `chrono` crate (by optional default feature `oldtime`), but rarely anyone is using it. Almost all our dependencies already disable the default features on `chrono` - but `kube-rs` is the only exception I found so far. Turns out you don't use `oldtime` feature either.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nSimply disable the default features :)", "reactions": {"url":

This\r\nconfiguration should also be usable in [GitHub Codespaces][ghcs].\r\n\r\nThis configuration ensures that various tools are available including:\r\n\r\n* `cargo-deny`\r\n* `cargo-tarpaulin`\r\n* `k3d`\r\n* `kubectl`\r\n* rust stable-1.56 toolchain\r\n* rust nightly toolchain\r\n* a few related VS Code plugins\r\n\r\nWhile this developer image is based on rust 1.56 (the documented MSRV\r\nfor the project), it updates the default toolchain to be _nightly_ so\r\nclippy and rustfmt work as expected (since `kube-rs` depends on nightly\r\nversions of these tools).\r\n\r\n[dc]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers\r\n[ghcs]: https://github.com/features/codespaces\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I'd rather not commit configuration for any single editor into the repo. On the other hand, having a working development environment in VS Code should dramatically reduce the setup time for new contributors. We've recently adopted devcontainers in Linkerd ([1](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pull/7583) [2](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/pull/1432)), so I thought I'd share a modified version for `kube-rs`. At the very least, this would help me; but I won't be offended if this isn't accepted here.\r\n\r\nNote that I've tried to omit anything touching developer-specific personalization (choice of shell, etc), leaving that to be configured in a `dotfiles` repo ([eg](https://github.com/olix0r/dotfiles/blob/main/bootstrap.sh)) and in user-specific vscode configuration.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/788/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/788/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/786", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/786/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/786/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/issues/786/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/786", "id": 1104978112, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCV2pXc4xGvN5", "number": 786, "title": "runtime: Store resources in an `Arc`", "user": {"login": "olix0r", "id": 240738, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDczOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240738?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r", "html_url": "https://github.com/olix0r", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/olix0r/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 3647066676, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCV2pXc7ZYdI0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/labels/changelog-change", "name": "changelog-change", "color": "292C21", "default": false, "description": "changelog change category for prs"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/milestones/7", "html_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/milestone/7", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/milestones/7/labels", "id": 7602549, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCV2pXc4AdAF1", "number": 7, "title": "0.68.0", "description": "", "creator": {"login": "clux", "id": 134092, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDA5Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134092?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux", "html_url": "https://github.com/clux", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clux/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 8, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2022-01-24T04:39:40Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-01T07:19:14Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2022-02-01T07:19:14Z"}, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2022-01-16T07:24:59Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-26T02:29:34Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-25T09:31:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "type": null, "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kube-rs/kube/pulls/786", "html_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/786", "diff_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/786.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/786.patch", "merged_at": "2022-01-25T09:31:43Z"}, "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe read-side of `kube_runtime::reflector`  is allocation-heavy: each read incurs a clone of the entire resource data structure.
