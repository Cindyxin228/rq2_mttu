Excited to play with async await.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a nitpick, but your examples dont work as examples. As you probably know you have them hooked up as binaries. Which is totally fine. But with this change they also work as examples\r\n\r\n`cargo run --release --example list`\r\nWhich is kind of nice because it will list them at the command line\r\n```\r\njacob@j:~/Downloads/bluez-rs (examples)$ cargo run --release --example \r\nerror: \"--example\" takes one argument.\r\nAvailable examples:\r\n    discover\r\n    list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI kept the bins working as well, but if you dont need that functionality, those could be removed from the cargo toml. Or feel free to close\r\n\r\nThanks again!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/10/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/10/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/8", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/8/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/8/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/8/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/laptou/bluez-rs/pull/8", "id": 591410991, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzk2NTg4MjY4", "number": 8, "title": "Update bitvec from v0.16 to v0.17", "user": {"login": "tpoliaw", "id": 4491567, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTE1Njc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4491567?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw", "html_url": "https://github.com/tpoliaw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpoliaw/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-03-31T20:40:16Z", "updated_at": "2020-06-28T05:42:04Z", "closed_at": "2020-04-14T22:56:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/pulls/8", "html_url": "https://github.com/laptou/bluez-rs/pull/8", "diff_url": "https://github.com/laptou/bluez-rs/pull/8.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/laptou/bluez-rs/pull/8.patch", "merged_at": "2020-04-14T22:56:44Z"}, "body": "Bits trait was renamed to AsBits in v0.17.1 and LittleEndian/BigEndian\r\nwere renamed Lsb0 and Msb0 respectively.\r\n\r\nFixes #7 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/8/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/laptou/bluez-rs/issues/8/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]
