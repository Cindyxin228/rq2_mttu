I noticed that your current CI workflow takes a lot of time to run. This PR improves it:\r\n\r\n- Each step has been separated in different jobs (with matrix jobs for tests). This allows to run task concurrency, and makes the workflow easier to understand.\r\n- Dependencies are cached with [Swatinem/rust-cache](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache) and [baptiste0928/cargo-install](https://github.com/baptiste0928/cargo-install) to speed up workflows.\r\n- Clippy is also run on tests (I fixed few lints)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22115890/151025632-271f3329-7a63-4a1c-9c20-3786e985f7f3.png)\r\n\r\nWith these improvements, the workflow takes only 12 minutes to complete, vs. half an hour with the current one.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a lot of useless commits, I suggest you to squash-merge the PR instead of a regular merge.", "reactions": {"url":
