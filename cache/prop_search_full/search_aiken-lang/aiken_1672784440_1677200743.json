double-quotes for utf-8 bytearrays, and @\"...\" for string literals**\r\n    The core observation is that **in the context of Aiken** (i.e. on-chain logic)\r\n  people do not generally want to use String. Instead, they want\r\n  bytearrays.\r\n\r\n  So, it should be easy to produce bytearrays when needed and it should\r\n  be the default. Before this commit, `\"foo\"` would parse as a `String`.\r\n  Now, it parses as a `ByteArray`, whose bytes are the UTF-8 bytes\r\n  encoding of \"foo\".\r\n\r\n  Now, to make this change really \"fool-proof\", we now want to:\r\n\r\n  - [x] Emit a parse error if we parse a UTF-8 bytearray literal in\r\n    place where we would expect a `String`. For example, `trace`,\r\n    `error` and `todo` can only be followed by a `String`.\r\n\r\n    So when we see something like:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    trace \"foo\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    we know it's a mistake and we can suggest users to use:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    trace @\"foo\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    instead.\r\n\r\n  - [x] Emit a warning if we ever see a bytearray literals UTF-8, which\r\n    is either 56 or 64 character long and is a valid hexadecimal string.\r\n    For example:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    let policy_id = \"29d222ce763455e3d7a09a665ce554f00ac89d2e99a1a83d267170c6\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This is _most certainly_ a mistake, as this generates a ByteArray of\r\n    56 bytes, which is effectively the hex-encoding of the provided string.\r\n\r\n    In this scenario, we want to warn the user and inform them they probably meant to use:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    let policy_id = #\"29d222ce763455e3d7a09a665ce554f00ac89d2e99a1a83d267170c6\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Fix acceptance tests to use new syntax.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: <strike>Emit parse error when finding a ByteArray literal instead of String literal.</strike> (reverted later)\r\n \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Emit warning when detecting an hex string interpreted as UTF-8 bytes.**\r\n    This will probably save people minutes/hours of puzzled debugging. This is only a warning because there may be cases where one do actually want to specify an hex-encoded bytearray. In which case, they can get rid of the warning by using the plain bytearray syntax (i.e. as an array of bytes).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"912\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-18 at 11 33 13\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5680256/219855907-5ed2528e-11d6-45c0-9f79-f17cff56aff5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Remove parse error on bytearray literals for trace, todo & error, parse as String instead.**\r\n    This has been bothering me and the more I thought of it the more I\r\n  disliked the idea of a warning. The rationale being that in this very\r\n  context, there's absolutely no ambiguity. So it is only frustrating\r\n  that the parser is even able to make the exact suggestion of what\r\n  should be fixed, but still fails.\r\n\r\n  I can imagine it is going to be very common for people to type:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  trace \"foo\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ...yet terribly frustrating if they have to remember each time that\r\n  this should actually be a string. Because of the `trace`, `todo` and\r\n  `error` keywords, we know exactly the surrounding context and what to\r\n  expect here. So we can work it nicely.\r\n\r\n  However, the formatter will re-format it to:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  trace @\"foo\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Just for the sake of remaining consistent with the type-system. This\r\n  way, we still only manipulate `String` in the AST, but we conveniently\r\n  parse a double-quote utf-8 literal when coupled with one of the\r\n  specific keywords.\r\n\r\n  I believe that's the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/391/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/391/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/390", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/390/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/390/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/390/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/pull/390", "id": 1589633021, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHPXO-85KO7Iv", "number": 390, "title": "Remove complex constants.

untyped expression**\r\n    The goal is to handle this without bothering the code generation down the line. That is, we can handle it when transforming from the untyped AST to the typed one. That's why there's no 'TraceIfFalse' constructor in the typed AST. It has disappeared during type-check.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Implement parser & formater for 'TraceIfFalse'**\r\n    Interestingly enough, chumsky seems to fail when given a 'choice' with\r\n  more than 25 elements. That's why this commit groups together some of\r\n  the choices as another nested 'choice'.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Implement TraceIfFalse type-checking and AST transformation.**\r\n    This caused me some trouble. In my first approach, I ended up having\r\n  multiple traces because nested values would be evaluated twice; once\r\n  as condition, and once as part of the continuation.\r\n\r\n  To prevent this, we can simply evaluate the condition once, and return\r\n  plain True / False boolean as outcome. So this effectively transforms any\r\n  expression:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  expr\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  as\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  if expr { True } else { trace(\"...\", False) }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Make tracing configurable, when relevant.**\r\n    Tracing is now turn OFF by default when:\r\n\r\n  - building project\r\n  - building documentation\r\n  - building dependencies\r\n\r\n  It can be turned ON only when building project using `--keep-traces`.\r\n  That means it's not possible to build dependencies with traces. The\r\n  address `--rebuild` flag will also rebuild without traces.\r\n\r\n  Tracing is however turn ON by default when:\r\n\r\n  - checking the project (and running tests).\r\n\r\n  In this scenario, tracing can be disabled using `--no-traces` (if for\r\n  example, one want to analyze the execution units of specific functions\r\n  without having to manually remove traces from code).\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add new acceptance test scenario: 063**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Swap arguments to unify when inferring traces**\r\n    The first argument shows as what the compiler expects in the error message. So it must be the correct one or the error is actually misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"790\" alt=\"image\"

reasons:\r\n\r\n* we force functions to have a specific name to identify purpose\r\n* regardless of there being 4 script purposes validators essentially have two forms 3 arguments or 2 arguments\r\n* because the names of the function were special it caused some confusion about how to use the same 2 argument validator for 2 different purposes.\r\n* Generally you'll need to pattern match on the script context anyways so having special purpose keywords isn't very useful\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\n* Validator `functions` are still defined in the `validators` folder\r\n  * This makes collecting them easy and we won't have to change much to extract them\r\n  * This also means we never even see `validators` in `dependencies` when compiling deps so we don't have to bother filtering those out. Even if an aiken project is just a library, they could still use the validators folder to maintain example use cases for their library.\r\n* [x] New syntax for defining validator functions inside validator modules\r\n  * [x] New syntax captures extra params separately\r\n  * [x] Formatting for the new syntax\r\n* [x] Type checking for the new definition `Definition::Validator(Validator { .. })`\r\n* [x] If this new syntax is used outside of a validator module a warning should be presented\r\n<img width=\"792\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 12 34 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12070598/219113860-7a88813b-a677-4f2c-83b2-1e203fcf052d.png\">\r\n\r\n* [x] On check if a validator function does not have at least 2 arguments an error should be presented\r\n  * [x] move assertions for return type and arity check to `infer.rs` this allows these to happen during `aiken check` instead of just on `aiken build`\r\n\r\n### New Syntax\r\n\r\n```aiken\r\nvalidator foo {\r\n  fn(datum, rdmr, ctx) -> Bool {\r\n    True\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvalidator foo(extra: ByteArray) {\r\n  fn(datum, rdmr, ctx) {\r\n    True\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bonus\r\n\r\n* [x] fix if expression scoping during typechecking", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/372/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/372/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/368", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/368/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/368/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/368/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/pull/368", "id": 1581983544, "node_id": "PR_kwDOHPXO-85J1JYo", "number": 368, "title": "Ready to merge.

`Constant::Integer(BigInt)`.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a need for a new way to get the `integer_log2` of `Constant::Integer` in `machine::Value::to_ex_mem`.\r\n\r\nWe've added some tests to the bottom of the `machine` module.\r\n\r\n## UPLC Parser\r\n\r\nIt was pretty easy/simple to go from a string to bytes to `BigInt` when parsing.\r\n\r\n## Flat\r\n\r\nFor the flat decoding/encoding is seemed appropriate to just cast `BigInt` to and from `i128` which made things very simple.\r\n\r\nIt seemed unlikely that people will have hardcoded constant larger than that, which is really the only

Let's start simple\r\n  and try to get some basic schema generated already.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Refactor build steps to generate blueprints instead**\r\n    The blueprint is generated at the root of the repository and is\r\n  intended to be versioned with the rest. It acts as a business card\r\n  that contains many practical information. There's a variety of tools\r\n  we can then build on top of open-source contracts. And, quite\r\n  importantly, the blueprint is language-agnostic; it isn't specific to\r\n  Aiken. So it is really meant as an interop format within the\r\n  ecosystem.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Refactor test collection to use the new CheckedModules method**\r\n    And also, caught a little issue regarding the filtering of test cases.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Move UPLC dump into separate function + log event.**\r\n    ```\r\n    Compiling aiken-lang/stdlib 43d8e740ffdf5febc59e51b7f0d5f8506115340c (examples/hello_world/build/packages/aiken-lang-stdlib)\r\n    Compiling aiken-lang/hello_world 1.0.0 (examples/hello_world)\r\n   Generating project's blueprint (examples/hello_world/plutus.json)\r\n    Exporting UPLC (examples/hello_world/artifacts)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add title to blueprint's validators**\r\n    And use it to prefix UPLC artifacts' names.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add title and description to exported types in the blueprint**\r\n    This also fixes a bug where the documentation of record constructor arguments would be dropped after type-checking. Took me a while to pinpoint.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Refactor blueprint & handle annotated schemas**\r\n    This also now introduce two levels of representable types (because it's needed at least for tuples):\r\n\r\n  Plutus Data (a.k.a Data) and UPLC primitives / constants (a.k.a Schema).\r\n\r\n  In practice, we don't want to specify blueprints that use direct UPLC primitives because there's little support for producing those in the ecosystem. So we should aim for producing only Data whenever we can. Yet we don't want to forbid it either in case people know what they're doing. Which means that we need to capture that difference well in the type modelling (in Rust and in the CIP-0057 specification).\r\n\r\n  I've also simplified the error type for now, just to provide some degree of feedback while working on this. I'll refine it later with proper errors.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Allow testing blueprint generation from Aiken programs**\r\n    This is quite something, because now we have a testing pipeline that\r\n  can also be used for testing other compiler-related stuff such as the\r\n  type-checker or the code generator.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Support tuples in blueprint generation.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add support for generics in the blueprint generation.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Fix nested generics and phantom-types, and handle list special case**\r\n    List of pairs are actually encoded as 'map'.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Handle opaque single-variant-single-field special case.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Fix help on unknown::module error.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Improve error reporting for the blueprint generation.**\r\n    Actually link schema error to source code with a span and a label. This is easily done and provides some extra context.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Use IndexMap throughout**\r\n     In an ideal world, I should have handlded that directly at the conflicting commit in the rebase, but this would have bubbled up through all commits... which I wasn't really quite keen on going through. So here's an extra ugly commit that comes and 'fix the rebase'.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Replace 'assets' with generated blueprints.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Better use of From/Tryfrom within the blueprint module.**\r\n  \r\n- :round_pushpin: **Define serde's Serialize/Deserialize for Program<DeBrujin>**\r\n    This will be useful to re-use this behavior in other structure that contains a Program<DeBruijn> without having to manually serialize or deserialize the entire structure.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Implement serde's Deserialize for blueprints.**\r\n    Here's a trick though: I got lazy (a bit) and did not write a full deserializer for Schema because this is busywork and not at all necessary at this stage. Instead, I've made the blueprint parameterized by a generic type <T>; which represents the type of the underlying blueprint's schema. When deserializing from JSON, we can default to 'Value' to get a free deserializer. Since all we're interested about is the program and the metadata (purpose and title) of a validator, it works nicely.\r\n\r\n  Serialization however expects a Blueprint<Schema>, and most of the functions operates over a Blueprint<Schema> anyway.\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Implement new command: address**\r\n    This calculates a validator's address from validators found in a blueprint. It also provides a convenient way to attach a delegation part to the validator if needs be. The command is meant to provide a nice user experience and works 'out of the box' for projects that have only a single validator. Just call 'aiken address' to get the validator's address.\r\n\r\n  Note that the command-line doesn't provide any option to configure the target network. This automatically assumes testnet, and will until we deem the project ready for mainnet. Those brave enough to run an Aiken's program on mainnet will find a way anyway.\r\n\r\n---\r\n---\r\n\r\nErrors preview:\r\n<img width=\"712\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 12 41 32\"

However,\r\n  prior to this commit, the cache key would be based of the dependency\r\n  version which can be either:\r\n\r\n  - A commit hash\r\n  - A branch or tag name\r\n\r\n  However, in the latter case, it means that the very first time we end\r\n  up fetching a dependency will lock its version forever (or until the\r\n  cache is cleared). This was inconvenient.\r\n\r\n  This commit changes that so that we use not only a branch name as\r\n  cache key, but additionally, the etag returned by the GitHub API\r\n  server. The etag is part of the HTTP headers, so it can be fetched\r\n  quickly using a simple HEAD request. It changes whenever the content\r\n  behind the endpoint changes -- which happens to be exactly what we\r\n  want. With this, we can quickly check whether an upstream package has\r\n  been updated and download the latest version should users have\r\n  specified a branch name as a version number.\r\n\r\n  For example, my current cache now looks as follow:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n   /Users/ktorz/Library/Caches/aiken/packages/\r\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 aiken-lang-stdlib-1cedbe85b7c7e9c4036d63d45cad4ced27b0d50b.zip\r\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 aiken-lang-stdlib-6b482fa00ec37fe936c93155e8c670f32288a686.zip\r\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 aiken-lang-stdlib-7ca9e659688ea88e1cfdc439b6c20c4c7fae9985.zip\r\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 aiken-lang-stdlib-main@04eb45df3c77f6611bbdff842a0e311be2c56390f0fa01f020d69c93ff567fe5.zip\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- :round_pushpin: **Add new command group 'deps' and 'clear-cache' command.**\r\n    This allows in case of issues with dependencies to at least safely\r\n  remove cached packages.

For example:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  { 14 + 42 } * 1337\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  can now be written as:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  ( 14 + 42 ) * 1337\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  This may sound straightforward at first but wasn't necessarily trivial\r\n  in Aiken given that (a) everything is an expression, (b) whitespaces\r\n  do not generally matter and (c) there's no symbol indicating the end\r\n  of a 'statement' (because there's no statement).\r\n\r\n  Thus, we have to properly disambiguate between:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  let foo = bar(14 + 42)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  and\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  let foo = bar\r\n  (14 + 42)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Before this commit, the latter would be interpreted as a function call\r\n  and would lead to a somewhat puzzling error. Now, the newline serves\r\n  as a delimiting symbol. The trade-off being that for a function call,\r\n  the left parenthesis has to be on the same line as the function name\r\n  identifier -- which is a fair trade off. So this is still allowed:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  let foo = bar(\r\n    14 + 42\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  As there's very little ambiguity about it.\r\n\r\n  This fixes #236 and would seemingly allow us to get rid of the leading\r\n  `#` in front of tuples.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aiken-lang/aiken/issues/254/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,
