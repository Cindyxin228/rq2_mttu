This PR aims to implement the request.\r\n\r\nList here your changes\r\n\r\n- If an article does not present an `updated` property, use `published` instead.\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n\r\nI was presented a [feed](https://git.sr.ht/~julienxx/asuka/refs/rss.xml) that does contain this `published` property, but through a different identifier, i.e. `pubDate`. I hope `feed_rs` maps them to the same field, if doesn't how can we achieve this?\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease select relevant options.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the contribution guidelines of this project\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code:\r\n  - If I'm not mistaken the `updated` property is shown on the top right of any feed within the TUI, and we can still see that.
