continued buffer parsing if the CLIENT_SESSION_TRACK\r\ncapability flag was set, without first checking if the buffer was non\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nThis logic assumes that with this capability flag set, that we always\r\nget extra info back in the OK packet related to session state. This is\r\nnot the case, as evidenced by executing a single row insert, where the\r\nOK packet returned will not have session state attached.\r\n\r\nThis causes us to parse an empty buffer, which modified earlier buffer\r\ncontents, resulting in incorrect result for `Affected Rows`. The result\r\nthis caused was always 0, which wasn't caught by current testing.\r\n\r\nWe replicated this with the following real world test case:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (id INT);\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t1 (id) VALUES (4);\r\nrows_affected: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the Ok packet that came back from this insert:\r\n\r\n`x00/x01/x00/x02/x00/x00/x00`\r\n\r\nWe can see that the rows affected should be 1, and we also see that no\r\nextra session info was attached to this packet. If we log at the\r\nbeginning of parsing, right after we parse the buffer for the\r\nrows_affected data, we get the correct result. If we instead put a log\r\nat the end of the method right before the Ok body is returned, we get a\r\nvalue of 0, indicating that parsing an empty buffer caused us to modify\r\nearlier buffer results.\r\n\r\nIf we instead do a multi-row insert, we get the correct result:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (id INT);\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t1 (id) VALUES (1), (2), (3);\r\nrows_affected: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because session state is passed back in the case of multi-row\r\ninserts.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this by checking that the buffer is non empty in the\r\ncase that the CLIENT_SESSION_TRACK compatibility flag is set. This also\r\nupdates our testing so our basic OK packet example has a rows affected\r\nresult that is non-zero.\r\n\r\nThis has also been tested externally with a demo application using\r\n`mysql_async` to confirm that rows_affected is correct in the single row\r\ninsert case with this capability flag set.", "reactions": {"url":
